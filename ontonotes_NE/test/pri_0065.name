According to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> 's office they 've agreed to maintain a measure of security cooperation , which had been on the verge of complete breakdown .
A phone call also represents something of a coup for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> , which is anxious to boost its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> role .
It was apparently engineered by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Putin</ENAMEX> during his talks with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> .
