<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Xinhua News Agency</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August 31st</ENAMEX> , by reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jihua Wen</ENAMEX>
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zemin Jiang</ENAMEX> will soon be visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ukraine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> .
Recently , he was respectively interviewed by reporters from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Fangfei Garden</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Diaoyutai State Guest House</ENAMEX> , and answered questions on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sino - Russian</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sino - French</ENAMEX> relations , and regional , international issues .
When a reporter asked about the present situation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sino - Russian</ENAMEX> relations and the prospects of co-operation , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zemin Jiang</ENAMEX> said that relations between the countries of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> have been developing smoothly in the areas of politics , economy and trade , science and technology , education , culture , etc. , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 3 years</ENAMEX> , especially after President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> 's visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 1992</ENAMEX> .
Both countries have maintained high level contact and relations ; negotiations on border divisions have achieved important results and significant progress has been made in disarmament negotiations at the border regions .
Trade volume has exceeded the highest historical levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sino - Russian</ENAMEX> trade for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> running .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> have become important mutual trade partners .
He said that " the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> are close neighbors .
I think that the people of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries , namely <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> are happy about the development of relations between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zemin Jiang</ENAMEX> said to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> reporters : " at the invitation of President <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> , I will be visiting your beautiful country in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</ENAMEX> .
Together with President <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> leaders , I will explore establishing friendly , neighborly and mutual , co-operative <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sino - Russian</ENAMEX> relations that will extend into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</ENAMEX> so as to raise the co-operation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries in various areas to a new level . "
When a reporter asked whether the fact that now a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> citizens overstay short - term visas after entering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> will become a factor in tense relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and how this problem should be solved , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zemin Jiang</ENAMEX> expressed that with the continuous development of friendly , neighborly relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries are no longer isolated from each other , and relations between them have expanded , with rapidly increasing staff contacts .
This process is very natural .
He said that " because necessary legislation and measures can not keep up with demands of the situation and development , certain phenomena of disorder occur , especially in contact at the border regions , resulting in some passive influences .
We hold that this type of situation is not good and should be improved and stopped .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent days</ENAMEX> , the situation has improved to a certain extent because both sides have co-operated in the adoption of some measures . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zemin Jiang</ENAMEX> said that " we should not ' stop eating because of a hiccup ' .
I hold that this is a problem that appears while relations between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries are being developed , and that if both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> take sincere , friendly , calm and realistic attitudes towards a joint effort , these problems can be solved appropriately , and that they are not , nor can they be factors of tense <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sino - Russian</ENAMEX> relations . "
Speaking of the reason for the decrease in the volume of trade between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> so far <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zemin Jiang</ENAMEX> said that " We have noticed that compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the same period last year</ENAMEX> , there is a drop in the volume of trade between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half of this year</ENAMEX> .
The reasons for the drop are manifold : both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> are implementing economic reforms , and there are changes in demands for each other 's goods ; changes in the visa system have also brought some effects in contacts between traders of both sides .
In international trade , increases and decreases in trade volume happen frequently .
I believe that the drop in the volume of trade between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> is only a temporary phenomenon .
Through joint efforts of both sides in encouraging large , powerful and reputable companies from each country to develop co-operation , trade between both countries will develop even more healthily .
There is no doubt that issues in this area will be within the scope of talks between the leaders of both countries . "
When interviewed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> reporters , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zemin Jiang</ENAMEX> said that " the situation in the development of relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> has been very good since their normalization <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barisque</ENAMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April</ENAMEX> , and now at the invitation of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitterrand</ENAMEX> I will be carrying out a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> for national affairs .
Trade relations between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries have also more quickly reached normalization and development .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half of this year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> exports to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> increased by 42.2 % compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the same period last year</ENAMEX> . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zemin Jiang</ENAMEX> pointed out that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> are strongly complementary to each other in economy , and that development prospects are good .
Both sides have quite a lot of identical or similar viewpoints on international issues .
He said that " I believe that as long as both sides make joint efforts , friendly co-operative relations between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries will definitely continue to develop on the principles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sino - French</ENAMEX> communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations and the joint communique issued on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 12th this year</ENAMEX> . "
When reporters asked about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea 's</ENAMEX> nuclear issue and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's role , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zemin Jiang</ENAMEX> emphasized that there are two goals <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is seeking on this issue : to maintain the peace and stability of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Korean Peninsula</ENAMEX> and to realize a non-nuclear region in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Korean Peninsula</ENAMEX> .
He said that " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> has always advocated resolution through direct talks between relevant sides .
We welcome the preliminary results achieved by the talks between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> , and have been playing an active role . "
When answering the question on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's government is hoping for contact with each country in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , or wants to have contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Union</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zemin Jiang</ENAMEX> said that " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is willing to have contact with each country in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> and also develop friendly co-operative relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Union</ENAMEX> .
I think that these two are mutually exclusive . "
When a reporter asked to what level contacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> could be extended by a country that maintains diplomatic relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zemin Jiang</ENAMEX> emphasized that all countries that have established diplomatic relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> have expressed their admission that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the People 's Republic of China</ENAMEX> is the only legal government representing all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> is an inseparable part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
They promised not to establish official relations or have contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> that is of an official nature .
He said that we have no objections to economic and trade relations kept between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> that are purely people - to - people .
