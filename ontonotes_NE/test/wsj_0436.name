<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco D.S. Inc.</ENAMEX> , the drugstore chain that filed for bankruptcy - court protection <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , received a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 925 million</ENAMEX> offer from a group led by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> billionaire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bass</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> reacted cautiously , saying the plan would add <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 260 million</ENAMEX> of new debt to the highly leveraged company .
It was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> 's huge debt from its <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</ENAMEX> leveraged buy - out in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> that forced it to seek protection under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bankruptcy Code</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> insists that the proposal is simply an `` expression of interest , '' because under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> has `` exclusivity rights '' until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 28</ENAMEX> .
Those rights prevent anyone other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> from proposing a reorganization plan .
Also under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> , a reorganization plan is subject to approval by bondholders , banks and other creditors .
A financial adviser for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> bondholders , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Schulte</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chilmark Partners</ENAMEX> , had mixed reactions to the offer .
He said he feared a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> reorganization might force bondholders to accept a `` cheap deal , '' and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bass</ENAMEX> group 's offer would give them more money .
However , the group is offering to pay off bondholders in cash only -- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 260.5 million</ENAMEX> -- and no equity .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> bonds are high - yield , high - risk `` junk '' bonds ; holders have <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million</ENAMEX> in claims against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulte</ENAMEX> said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> received the offer <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 20</ENAMEX> , but issued a response <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> only after a copy of the proposal was made public by bondholders .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Acadia Partners Limited Partnership</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> , partnership that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Robert M. Bass Group</ENAMEX> , made the proposal .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bass</ENAMEX> is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> .
Analysts said the nation 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second - largest</ENAMEX> drugstore chain was a valuable company , despite its financial woes .
Its problem , they say , is that management paid too much in the leveraged buy - out and the current <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 515 million</ENAMEX> debt load is keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> in the red .
`` If bought at the right price , it could still be profitable , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Stein</ENAMEX> , an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> .
In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,900</ENAMEX> stores in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</ENAMEX> states represent a lot of real estate , he said , and demographics are helping pharmacies : The nation 's aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> 's parent company , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Anac Holding Corp.</ENAMEX> , said the company reported a loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16.2 million</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fiscal first quarter</ENAMEX> , compared with a loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 27.9 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year - earlier quarter</ENAMEX> .
Sales were <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 597.8 million</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.4 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</ENAMEX> .
The company , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Twinsburg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , said its operating profit before depreciation and amortization increased <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.2 million</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.1 million</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Acadia Partners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bass Group</ENAMEX> declined to comment .
The partnership also includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Equitable Life Assurance Society</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ENAMEX> .
The offer consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 410.5 million</ENAMEX> in cash and the rest in notes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Acadia</ENAMEX> would sell up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> of the equity in the reorganized company to creditors and bondholders in exchange for the cash distribution , but creditors and bondholders would receive no discount for their shares .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> 's chairman and chief executive officer , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boake A. Sells</ENAMEX> , said both the company and the bondholders have put forth reorganization plans , but little progress has been made since negotiations began <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</ENAMEX> .
He said he has not met with representatives from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Acadia</ENAMEX> .
Any reorganization proposal , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sells</ENAMEX> said , is difficult to assess because it must be agreed upon by the company , bondholders , banks and other creditors .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</ENAMEX> in claims outstanding .
`` It 's not like the board can decide '' by itself , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sells</ENAMEX> said , adding , `` we 're indifferent to -LRB- the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bass</ENAMEX> -RRB- plan .
We just want a plan that satisfies creditors and at the end leaves a healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> . ''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulte</ENAMEX> , the bondholders ' adviser , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revco</ENAMEX> was dragging its feet in responding to the proposal .
`` They want to pretend it does n't exist , '' he said .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulte</ENAMEX> , who met with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Acadia</ENAMEX> representatives on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 10</ENAMEX> , said , `` It 's certainly a responsible offer .
It 's not an effort to steal the company '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the middle of the night</ENAMEX> .
