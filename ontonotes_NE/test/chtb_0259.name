In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong Province</ENAMEX> has exerted itself to explore new ways of attracting talent under market economy conditions , and has been active in using market mechanisms to allocate resources of talent , and has achieved preliminary results .
" Taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> step " in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> 's reform and opening up in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980's</ENAMEX> was closely related to the situation at that time of the " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peafowl Flying Towards the Southeast</ENAMEX> " -LRB- human talents from all over , one after another , going to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
With the overall opening up of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's coastal areas , frontier areas , riverside areas and capital cities of every province <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">since the 1990's</ENAMEX> , the flow of talent tends to be multi-directional and the competition has become increasingly fierce .
Further enhancing the attraction to talented persons has become the key point of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> 's further development .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Limo Qin</ENAMEX> , director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Talent Exchange and Service Center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong Province</ENAMEX> has done analysis and said : " the economic development rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</ENAMEX> was at an intermediate level of that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the recent years</ENAMEX> .
In that year it introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100,000</ENAMEX> talented persons of various types .
Developing at this rate , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next ten years</ENAMEX> , not including graduates from higher education institutes , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> 's talent gap is conservatively estimated to surpass <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 million</ENAMEX> .
Therefore , further opening minds and introducing talent are guidelines of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> 's policy regarding talented people . "
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , there have been more and more climaxes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> 's talent market .
Each year , there are several large - scale talent employment fairs whose service for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1000</ENAMEX> employers and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10,000</ENAMEX> applicants lasts for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than half a month</ENAMEX> .

<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</ENAMEX> cities such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shenzhen</ENAMEX> , etc. went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> national talent and technology exchange fair , where they established a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> employment booths .

<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1006</ENAMEX> students abroad filled out application forms , and quite a number of people have successively returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> to take jobs .
At the same time , the construction of talent market is also accelerating .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Since 1991</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shenzhen</ENAMEX> established the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> standing talent market , such " all - weather " talent exchange organizations have rapidly spread in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Zhujiang Delta</ENAMEX> and all cities within the province .
Now , there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</ENAMEX> cities with relatively more advanced economies in the province having built up regular markets .
In order to further enhance the attraction of talent , to break through the barrier of " departmental ownership " of talent , and to promote the flow of talent by forming mechanisms of independent employment and job choice , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong Province</ENAMEX> has also paid greater attention to the formulation of relevant policies and regulations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Limo Qin</ENAMEX> said in his introduction that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> the provincial government has successively issued documents such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">" Temporary regulations on encouraging persons studying abroad to work in Guangdong "</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">" Notices on better advertising for talent "</ENAMEX> , etc .
It will soon promulgate documents such as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">" Detailed rules for implementing temporary regulations on resignations of specialists , technicians and managers in state - owned units "</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">" Supplementary regulations of Guangdong Province on the management of Chinese side cadres in foreign investment enterprises "</ENAMEX> , etc .
