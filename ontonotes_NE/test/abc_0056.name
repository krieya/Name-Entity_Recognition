People are trying to reach their people somewhere else .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">La Guardia Airport</ENAMEX> has been a nightmare <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , but there is some good news .
Even with the bad weather and the number of people flying , the industry says <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 million</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> alone , things are not as bad as they might be .
Here 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Jamieson</ENAMEX> .
Reporter :
At <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">O'Hare Airport</ENAMEX> , ground <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</ENAMEX> for air travel troubles <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</ENAMEX> -- there was a holiday surprise .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">220,000</ENAMEX> passengers jammed the airport , but with good weather and labor peace at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Airlines</ENAMEX> , there were few delays .
We 're actually on time <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
A rare thing that happens here .
Reporter :
There were scattered delays in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> .
Snow fell <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">all day long</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northeast</ENAMEX> , causing poor visibility , but little stayed on the ground .
Across the country , skies were clear at almost every major airline hub and little change is expected tomorrow , which was particularly welcome at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hartsfield Airport</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this week</ENAMEX> , bad weather added to a labor dispute between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Delta Airlines</ENAMEX> and its pilots caused scores of cancellations and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of delays .
Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Delta</ENAMEX> said it was forced to cancel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> of its flights today , because some pilots refused overtime .
This journey started at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">6:45 a.m.</ENAMEX> , and it does n't look like there 's any promise of getting out of here <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> .
Reporter :
Analysts say travelers should still consider <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> an early <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</ENAMEX> present .
Anybody that thinks this will be the way that air travel is through the rest of the holidays and into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2001</ENAMEX> are in for a real surprise .
This is not at all the way things usually are .
Reporter :
Which may explain why so many , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 45 million</ENAMEX> people , are traveling by car <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</ENAMEX> , up sharply from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
And few problems are reported .
All aboard .
Reporter :
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Amtrak</ENAMEX> is expected to have more passengers too .
I take the train because it 's a lot more sane than flying .
Reporter :
The rail carrier is adding <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,000</ENAMEX> seats in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northeast</ENAMEX> alone , many for passengers who decided not to take a chance on the weather or the airlines .
