The frenetic stock and bond markets cooled off , but the dollar slumped .

Prices of long - term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds hovered in a narrow band most of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> , finishing little changed despite the dollar 's weakness and fears about a wave of government borrowing coming soon .
Helped by futures - related program buying , the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.92</ENAMEX> points to close at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2643.65</ENAMEX> .

Bond prices rallied early <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> as traders scrambled to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> issues on fears that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northern California</ENAMEX> earthquake might lead to a stock - market debacle .
But when stocks held steady , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds later retreated .
Speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> will lower interest rates in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">coming weeks</ENAMEX> helped push the dollar down while boosting stocks , traders said .
But many investors remain wary about stocks , partly because they expect continued turbulence in the junk - bond market that would make it more difficult to finance corporate takeovers .
`` I 'm surprised we did n't see more volatility '' in stocks , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond F. DeVoe Jr.</ENAMEX> , market strategist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Legg Mason Wood Walker</ENAMEX> .
`` I think the problems in the junk - bond area are just beginning , and this will be very unsettling for companies that have issued junk bonds .
In a bull market , credit does not matter , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeVoe</ENAMEX> added .
`` But when it does matter , then it 's the only thing that matters . ''
However , many institutional investors are reacting to the stock market 's plunge as `` a great buying opportunity , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles I. Clough</ENAMEX> , chief investment strategist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ENAMEX> .
`` Things are beginning to settle down .
The markets are returning to normalcy . ''
Oil prices initially rose on fears that the massive earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northern California</ENAMEX> would disrupt production .
But prices <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">later</ENAMEX> reversed course , finishing slightly lower , as investors concluded that any cuts would n't be large and that foreign oil producers would quickly pick up the slack .
In major market activity :
Stock prices rose .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> volume shrank to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">166.9 million</ENAMEX> shares from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">224.1 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> .
