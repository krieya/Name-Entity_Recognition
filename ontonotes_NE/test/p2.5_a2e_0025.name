Who in the construction company is robbing us ?
Who is developing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Riyadh</ENAMEX> at our expense ?
Is the construction company a charitable company so that it should provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Riyadh</ENAMEX> area with services at its own expense and without any economic feasibility ?
Does it make sense that a real estate company with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a capital of one billion</ENAMEX> ca n't make <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % of</ENAMEX> its capital ?
I mean , if you gave that sum to an uneducated <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> caretaker , he would make at least a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % profit</ENAMEX> from rentals .
Other real estate companies make at least <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> a year from their capital .
These guys have set up a charity with our money or they 're sharing out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">the 20 %</ENAMEX> in an indirect way !!!
My <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> , it 's terrible that we should put our trust in thieves like these and I think we should stop keeping quiet and expose them ...
Do these thieves think we do n't know what they 're doing and how they 're stealing ? And who is robbing us behind our backs ?
We thought they would stop stealing and give us what we are due but it seems that they despise our ability to stop them and expose them ... but when we do , their pleading will be useless .
King <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul Aziz</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> rest his soul , was wise when he said do not combine government and trade !!
Choose either government or trade because combining the two sooner or later leads to the government being toppled and trade being unprofitable .
