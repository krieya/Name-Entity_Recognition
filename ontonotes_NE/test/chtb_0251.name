<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Xinhua News Agency</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 23rd</ENAMEX> , by reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Futian Yang</ENAMEX>
Here , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Zijin Mountain Astronomical Observatory</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Academy of Science</ENAMEX> , issued the specific forecasted time to observe <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Shoemaker - Levy 9 comet 's</ENAMEX> collision with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
This provides a rare opportunity for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> astronomers and amateurs to observe this astronomic phenomenon of rare human experience .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">The Shoemaker - Levy 9 comet</ENAMEX> , which was discovered by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> astronomers in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1993</ENAMEX> , has now split into <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</ENAMEX> nuclei and has been moving at high speed towards <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> .
It will collide with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> and explode in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> .
This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> forecast of a magnificent collision phenomenon between celestial bodies of the solar system in human history .
On the basis of international observations , forecast data , and many years of their own research observations and precise calculations concerning asteroids and comets , planet research experts at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Zijin Mountain Astronomical Observatory</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX> recently forecasted the specific time for observing this astronomic phenomenon from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> collision of this comet with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> will occur at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">3:30 AM</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the wee hours of July 17th</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Beijing</ENAMEX> time , and the serial number of the colliding nucleus is No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</ENAMEX> .
This collision will be unobservable in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> collision observable in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> will occur at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">2:30 PM on the 17th</ENAMEX> and the serial number of the nucleus is No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</ENAMEX> .
This collision is observable with a radio telescope .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> collision observable in the night sky of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> will occur at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">7:30 PM of the 17th</ENAMEX> and the serial number of the colliding nucleus is No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</ENAMEX> .
Within <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes after</ENAMEX> the collision , the collision area will start to face <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> .
Astronomy amateurs can observe it with a suitable mini-type astronomical telescope .
A more powerful collision is expected to occur at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10:30 that night</ENAMEX> , and the serial number of the nucleus is No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> .
The collision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</ENAMEX> comet nuclei will last for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five and a half days</ENAMEX> .
According to astronomy experts of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Zijin Mountain Astronomical Observatory</ENAMEX> , the speed at the time of collision between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</ENAMEX> nuclei and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> will be as high as <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 km / s</ENAMEX> .
Among them , the diameters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</ENAMEX> larger nuclei range from <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 to 4 kilometers</ENAMEX> .
The energy of the explosion at collision time will reach <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as high as 10 trillion tons</ENAMEX> of TNT dynamite , equivalent to the explosive power of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 million</ENAMEX> atomic bombs similar to those dropped on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX> .
A colossal fireball and soaring mushroom cloud may be formed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> 's atmosphere whose projectiles would be thrown to a height of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several thousand kilometers</ENAMEX> .
Astronomers stressed that the collision between the comet and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> will be <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">770 to 780 million kilometers</ENAMEX> away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> , corresponding to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</ENAMEX> times the distance between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Sun</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> , and therefore will impose no direct impact on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> .
According to astronomy experts , the observation and study of this comet colliding with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> will help both the in - depth revelation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> 's mysteries of the rosy clouds , the great red spot , and corona and also help in developing research on the odds , forecast accuracy and explosive effects , etc. of comets and asteroids ' collision with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> .
