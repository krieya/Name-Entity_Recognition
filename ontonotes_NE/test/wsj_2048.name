<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT" E_OFF="2">HUGO'S</ENAMEX> BLAST generates pleas for aid from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> small businesses .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Small Business Administration</ENAMEX> has received <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 5,000</ENAMEX> formal requests for disaster loans because of the hurricane .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 45 %</ENAMEX> of requests for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SBA</ENAMEX> relief loans , which also are available to homeowners , come from small businesses , compared with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</ENAMEX> business share after most disasters .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SBA</ENAMEX> expects to make <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> loans .
The disaster fund is replenished by loan repayments .
Hardest hit by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> were small retailers tied to the tourist industry and businesses in agriculture and cultivated seafood .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The State Development Board</ENAMEX> set up a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX> Hotline to accept business - to - business help .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> weather man <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willard Scott</ENAMEX> broadcast the hot - line number , it was flooded with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</ENAMEX> calls .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> began using its national TV show to seek help , such as equipment , for business owners .
Local bankers and accountants help applicants fill out forms .
`` It helps us , and people feel better talking to someone who 's gone through the same thing , '' an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SBA</ENAMEX> official says .
HEALTH BENEFITS remain a central lobbying effort , even as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 89</ENAMEX> fades .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> , after deleting <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 89</ENAMEX> repeal from its deficit - reduction bill , still is expected to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> in voting to kill the law , which forces companies to provide comparable benefits to laborers and executives alike .
In lobbying on other health - coverage topics , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Federation of Independent Business</ENAMEX> will press for legislation that would give self - employed people a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</ENAMEX> tax deduction for their own health plans , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</ENAMEX> currently .
And the group will urge that the federal government pre-empt state rules on what must be covered by employers ' health insurance .
Small - business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">groups</ENAMEX> also will fight the medical - leave provision of legislation that would expand parental leaves .
And they still oppose as too costly an employer - paid health insurance bill sponsored by Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kennedy</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass .</ENAMEX> -RRB- despite his proposal to phase in small business only gradually .
There is also worry that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Pepper Commission</ENAMEX> studying long - term health care will again push lawmakers toward employerpaid solutions .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 89</ENAMEX> victory could have a downside by making it harder to oppose lawmakers on other health proposals .
`` With the repeal of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 89</ENAMEX> , we can no longer say they 're discouraging businesses from offering health plans , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christine Russell</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chamber of Commerce 's</ENAMEX> small - business advocate .
JUMPING THE GUN :
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> -RRB- was outraged after a private word to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Motley</ENAMEX> , lobbyist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Federation of Independent Business</ENAMEX> , resulted in a news release saying that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> chairman would recommend repeal of Section <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</ENAMEX> .
Even though the announcement was true in the end , it was issued without the senator 's permission .
`` I blew it , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Motley</ENAMEX> says apologetically .
`` It was a timing mistake . ''
PRISON - SHOP BLUES :
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strom Thurmond</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.C .</ENAMEX> -RRB- protests pending legislation to end the preference that the federal prison system gets in selling prisoner - made furniture and other goods to government agencies .
Small - business suppliers want prisons to stop getting high priority , especially as prison production grows with swelling inmate populations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , the prisons ' sales to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> totaled <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 336 million</ENAMEX> .
REPAIR SHOPS SCRAP for more access to work on auto - emissions systems .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Groups</ENAMEX> representing some independent auto - repair shops join a compromise on <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Clean Air legislation</ENAMEX> worked out between environmentalists and Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Waxman</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif .</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
The plan would increase the warranty on auto - emission systems to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80,000 miles</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</ENAMEX> for major parts .
But the warranty on simpler parts would be lowered to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24,000 miles</ENAMEX> .
The garage owners say they would benefit because car owners would be less likely to go back to dealers for the simpler repairs after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> .
The repair shops are n't united , however .
Shops represented by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Automotive Service Industry Association</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association</ENAMEX> oppose any increase in warranty length .
They say the longer the warranty , the longer customers will automatically return to new - car dealers , which then find non-warranty work that might otherwise go to repair shops .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The House Energy Committee</ENAMEX> will debate the issue <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">later this month</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan Hathcock</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> garage owner who opposes a longer warranty , estimates that the current plan costs him <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 15,000</ENAMEX> a year in lost business .
SMALL TALK :
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Some 70 %</ENAMEX> of graduates who recently earned an M.B.A. degree say they 'd prefer to work in or own a small company , yet most take jobs with large concerns , says a survey by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Foster McKay Group</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> recruiting firm ... .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cardinal Scientific Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waldorf</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Md.</ENAMEX> , seeks a Small Business Innovation Research grant to produce a `` nozzle assembly for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Army</ENAMEX> mass delousing outfit .
