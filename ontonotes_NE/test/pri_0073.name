I have a number of suggestions to help you through your national crisis over who should be the next President .
And The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">World</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddie Mair</ENAMEX> has included them in this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> 's letter from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> .
Normally I would n't interfere in your politics , at least not since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> called me and asked whether she should stand in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
I advised her there was more chance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy Giuliani</ENAMEX> being caught with another woman than there was of her winning elected office .
But your post-election dilemma leads me to put forward a number of ideas to assist you at this , the most critical moment <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> have faced since they changed the taste of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Coke</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> of all , what about allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> just to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> time ?
We know him , he knows us , and it has never been dull .
What 's more , he enjoys his special relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX> , and he has formed special relationships with , well you set your own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> intern , joke here .
Another way of deciding who should be your next leader is by putting the word President in front of the candidate 's surnames .
If you say President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> , does it send a shiver up your spine ? and surely to goodness we 'll never have a President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> .
Certainly that 's how I am going to refer to them both for the rest of this letter .
I suggest you try it at home .
Alternatively , why not give the presidency to the candidate who stands in front of the largest number of flags during his news conferences .
Both President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> and President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> have held a flurry of news conferences in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</ENAMEX> and with each one they have increased the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Stars and Stripes</ENAMEX> they use as a backdrop .
I think they think it makes them look patriotic and presidential .
Things got out of hand on <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Monday night</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> appeared in front of what appeared to be <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Stars and Stripes</ENAMEX> .
It looked like an explosion in a flag factory .
I stopped listening to what he was saying and started wondering where this would end .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> I 'm confident President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will be wearing a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Stars and Stripes</ENAMEX> suit with matching tie , shoes , shirt and underwear .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> will come out with his face painted in patriotic colors and by the weekend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> would have changed his name to ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">America</ENAMEX> , ' just to prove how <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> he really is .
Having said that I saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> Prime Minister celebrate his re-election in front of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Maple Leaves</ENAMEX> , but who cares about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> .
I 'm sorry if all of this sounds like a load of nonsense which undermines the entire principle of democracy .
I know <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> would never really stand for that , would you ?
Till next time , yours truly , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddie Mair</ENAMEX> .
