Time for `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lifeline</ENAMEX> '' -- and fresh evidence <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> the kind of medical care you receive depends to a large degree on where you live , but maybe not for the reasons you 'recg .
It 's not just poor versus rich areas or rural versus urban .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Hager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> on `` geographic destiny . ''
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florence Kramer</ENAMEX> discovered she had breast cancer , a doctor in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Farmington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> , told her she needed a mastectomy -- breast removal .
I panicked and was frightened , and real depressed and upset .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 miles</ENAMEX> away in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX> , doctors told her a less invasive lumpectomy , should be enough .
Man , I was overjoyed .
Her lumpectomy , was a success , and her case an example of the startling differences in doctors ' choices of treatment , from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> geographic area to the next .
It 's all documented in an ongoing statistical analysis called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">`` the Dartmouth College Atlas of Health Care</ENAMEX> , '' directed by Dr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Wennberg</ENAMEX> .
What we 're seeing is that in health care geography is basically destiny , meaning you may be destined , if you live in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> community , to have major surgery for the same problem normally treated , somewhere else , with a less invasive procedure or without surgery at all .
For instance , the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Atlas</ENAMEX> finds , a breast cancer patient in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rapid City</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX> is twice as likely to have a mastectomy , as a patient with the same problem in the western suburbs of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> .
Prostate cancer , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baton Rouge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> , surgery , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</ENAMEX> times more likely than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Binghamton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
Heart disease , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bloomington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> , bypass operation , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> times more likely , than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albuquerque</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> .
A back problem , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Barbara</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , surgery <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> times more likely , than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronx</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
Why these great variations ?
Not what you may think .
Not the size of the community , the wealth of the patients , or quality of the hospital .
It seems to be more what doctors in each area are used to recommending , but patients do n't know that .
The problem of this incredible variation is to get the patients involved in making decisions that express their own preferences .
So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dartmouth</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hitchcock Hospital</ENAMEX> has what 's called a `` shared decision making center , '' where patients are carefully presented all the options even shown videos , and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> , a patient advocate has this advice -- when the physician says , `` I believe you ought to have this procedure , '' the very next question you ask is `` well , why are you recommending that ? '' and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> question is `` what alternatives would you recommend , and what are my choices ? ''
Just why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florence Kramer</ENAMEX> traveled <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 miles</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> opinion .
If I 'm going to have something done to my body I want to know about it .
I want to know everything there is to know about it .
How she overcame geographic destiny avoided a mastectomy and remains cancer free , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
