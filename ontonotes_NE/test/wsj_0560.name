When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse Electric Corp.</ENAMEX> shuttered its massive steam turbine plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lester</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</ENAMEX> , it seemed like the company had pulled the plug on its century - old power generation business .
But now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> is enjoying a resurgence in demand for both steam and combustion turbines and may even join the growing legion of independent electric producers .
And with its new venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.</ENAMEX> , announced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> , it is poised to penetrate growing markets overseas .
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1970s</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> has seen a significant increase in orders for power plants .
Most are from independent producers instead of regulated utilities , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> believes it will ride a wave of demand stretching over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next six years</ENAMEX> .
Analysts agree , predicting that the revived market could significantly boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> 's bottom line in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">coming years</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> 's earnings could be materially enhanced in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1990s</ENAMEX> or sooner , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell L. Leavitt</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salomon Brothers Inc</ENAMEX> .
The company expects a need for <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">140,000 megawatts</ENAMEX> of new generation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next decade</ENAMEX> .
Already <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , it has received orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 - megawatt</ENAMEX> advanced combustion turbines from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Florida Power -AMP- Light Co.</ENAMEX> and for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 - megawatt</ENAMEX> plants from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intercontinental Energy Corp.</ENAMEX> , among others .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> 's own role as a supplier also is changing .
In the past , the company usually took token equity positions in power plants it supplied as a `` kicker '' to close deals .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last June 's</ENAMEX> annnouncement that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> would put up all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70 million</ENAMEX> to build a new <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">55 - megawatt</ENAMEX> plant could herald a new age .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> 's plant will provide electrical power to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Southern California Edison Co.</ENAMEX> and backup power and steam to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Borax -AMP- Chemical Co</ENAMEX> .
`` We have n't decided on a strategy yet , but we could become an independent producer depending on whether we 're the developer or just the supplier , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore Stern</ENAMEX> , executive vice president of the company 's energy and utility systems group .
At the same time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> hopes its venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> will help fend off growing competition , particularly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , from such <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> competitors as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Asea Brown Boveri AG</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Siemens AG</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">British General Electric Co</ENAMEX> .
Under the agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> will be able to purchase smaller combustion turbines from its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> partner , and package and sell them with its own generators and other equipment .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> also jointly will bid on projects with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Misubishi</ENAMEX> , giving it an edge in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> markets .
In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> companies will develop new steam turbine technology , such as the plants ordered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Florida Power</ENAMEX> , and even utilize each other 's plants at times to take advantage of currency fluctuations .
`` Even though we 'll still compete against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> , we can also work jointly on some projects , and we 'll gain a lot of sourcing flexibility , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stern</ENAMEX> contends .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> - Mitsubishi venture was designed as a non-equity transaction , circumventing any possible antitrust concerns .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> carefully crafted the agreement because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> successfully challenged a proposed steam turbine joint venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Asea Brown Boveri</ENAMEX> .
It is expected that the current surge in demand for new power will be filled primarily by independent producers which , unlike utilities , are n't regulated and therefore do n't need government approval to construct new plants .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> expects <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</ENAMEX> of its new orders for turbines to come from independent producers for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at least the next six years</ENAMEX> .
Despite shutdowns of the company 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lester</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> plants , the company believes it has sufficient capacity to meet near - term demand with its much smaller and more efficient manufacturing facilities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> .
Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> acknowledges that demand from independent producers could evaporate if prices for fuel such as natural gas or oil rise sharply or if utilities , which have been pressured by regulators to keep down rates , are suddenly freed to add significant generating capacity .
Even if that scenario occurs , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> figures it is prepared .
The company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an order for a domestic nuclear plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John C. Marous</ENAMEX> , chairman and chief executive officer , says he expects a commercial order by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> for the company 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">AP600</ENAMEX> nuclear power plant , which is under development .
`` Once we see an order , we expect it 'll be on line by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</ENAMEX> .
