<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sheraton Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pan American World Airways</ENAMEX> announced that they and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> partners will construct <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> `` world - class '' hotels within <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Red Square</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> officials hailed the joint project as a new indication of the further thaw in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - Soviet relations .
`` This is an outstanding example of how the East and the West can work together for their mutual benefit and progress , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> Ambassador <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuri Dubinin</ENAMEX> , who hosted a signing ceremony for the venture 's partners at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> embassy here .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Mosbacher</ENAMEX> , who attended the ceremony , called the undertaking a `` historic step '' in the evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - Soviet ties .
He added that it likely will have a `` mulitiplier effect '' in stimulating further trade between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries .
The project will be the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - backed joint venture to be undertaken in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of the hotels , to be called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Sheraton Moscow</ENAMEX> , will have <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</ENAMEX> rooms and will cost <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 75 million</ENAMEX> to build .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> - story hotel will be on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gorky Street</ENAMEX> and initially will cater mostly to business travelers .
It will have a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> tavern , an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">English</ENAMEX> pub , a discotheque and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Italian</ENAMEX> restaurants , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sheraton</ENAMEX> announcement .
The hotel is scheduled to open in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> hotel , to be called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Budapest Hotel</ENAMEX> , is to be constructed at a site even closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Red Square</ENAMEX> .
Details about its size and cost have n't yet been determined .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sheraton</ENAMEX> , a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ITT Corp.</ENAMEX> , will have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> share in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> hotels ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pan American</ENAMEX> , a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pan Am Corp.</ENAMEX> , will have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> share .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> owners will be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mossoviet</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> 's city governing body , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> national airline .
Although a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Finnish</ENAMEX> group has a minority interest in an already operating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> hotel , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sheraton</ENAMEX> - Pan Am venture will be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> joint - venture hotels in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 50 %</ENAMEX> foreign ownership .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> companies account for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 8 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</ENAMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> joint ventures that have been announced since the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> began encouraging such undertakings in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> .
But some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> companies are negotiating projects that could be among the biggest ones to be launched .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chevron Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Amoco Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Archer - Daniels - Midland Co.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastman Kodak Co.</ENAMEX> are among the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> companies known to be considering such ventures .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sheraton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pan Am</ENAMEX> said they are assured under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> joint - venture law that they can repatriate profits from their hotel venture .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Sheraton Moscow</ENAMEX> will charge <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 140 to $ 150</ENAMEX> a day for each of its rooms , and it will accept payment only in currencies that can be traded in foreign exchange markets , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sheraton</ENAMEX> executive .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Plaskett</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pan Am 's</ENAMEX> chairman , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> airline 's participation is a natural outgrowth of its current arrangements with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> to jointly operate nonstop New York - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> flights .
He said the rising volume of passenger traffic on this route justifies a major investment in new high - standard <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> hotels .
