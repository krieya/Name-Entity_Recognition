The thing about it is the city is so beautiful
but I it is so trashy too
there 's parts of it where I mean they just do n't nobody takes care of it
I mean there 's litter on the ground
and there 's I mean there 's parts of the city that are just you know graffiti on the wall
and %hm . you know that it 's really it 's really kind of sad because it 's such a historical city and and there 's parts of it that is not taken care of at all
but anyway
so we did a service project and %um went and picked up went and picked picked up trash you know
and %um we were all out there on the street %um that goes leads down to the old city
and you know all these <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> started coming out and helping us
and their kids started coming out and helping us
and some of them would just come out and just stare you know just be like like all and just kind of like just kind of in amazement wondering what we 're doing
and I do n't know
I just kind of felt you know there 's there 's a lot there 's more than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> way to do missionary work here oh yeah . you know
so it 's it 's really good
the people have very good impression of us down here
they 're whenever we go into the stores they 're like you 're a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mormon</ENAMEX>
you are welcome here you know
you you it 's special discount for you because you 're a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mormon</ENAMEX>
you 're wonderf-
we like you
yeah
I 'll bet they give you a special discount though
we like your Amer- good <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> money
Some of them though
like there 's this coup-
What ?
They like your good <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> money .
yeah
they do .
Some of them invite us over f- for dinner at their house
and
Did you go ?
%um I have n't gone yet
but there 's this one guy that
he sells %um
what 's his name
his name 's %um <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX>
he has a shop
he sells sandals and and stuff like that
and so he he always invites %um like %ah invites <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about twelve</ENAMEX> students over at a time you know and he 'd and %uh ha- invites them over for dinner at his house
there 's a couple other people that are really good friends tha- %um that always deal with the chi- the kids from the center that are pretty well known
and so like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar</ENAMEX> he he just sells olivewood carvings that are absolutely beautiful
and there 's a couple other people that that 's it 's not as ki- it 's kind of fun to interact with them
and and anyway it 's it 's fun really fun .
%huh .
It 's different being down here though
it 's there 's you know a lot differences
the food is really good though
the bread is wonderful
like everywhere you go there 's pita bread and the other kind of bread that you like dipped in herbs and spices and stuff
and it is really good
the bread down here is good
and there 's lots of fruit
there 's like %um pomegranate trees everywhere
I did n't realize that pomegranates were grown down here .
%huh .
We even have one outside of our outside of our room on our balcony .
Do they have fresh prom- pomegranates on it right now ?
It does
you can eat em
they 're good .
oh wow
really fun .
There 's trees all over
like okay let me describe my room
it 's
you go outside
the coolest thing is is that like %um the whole center is built on a hill
and so instead of
I mean it 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> floors
but it does n't like it 's not like high rise <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> floors
it just kind of cascades down the mountain
you know what I 'm saying ?
yeah
you sent me that picture
so
oh yeah
so you kind of see it saw it
which one did I send you
is it just of the center ?
yeah
just like an aerial aerial view .
oh yeah
okay so you know what I 'm talking about
yeah
Anyway
and so then %um like our room is on the floor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> floor
mhm .
and you actually go outside to get to our room
there 's a hallway that 's outside
and then the rooms are just
I mean they look like little apartments you know that you get into
and there 's %um
the hallway is just all done in marble
and %um you know there 's trees in the hallway
and and there 's ivy that grows on the wall
and you come into the room
uh-huh
and %um and you know it 's got our beds and the bathroom and stuff
and then and then there 's a patio where you go outside
and there 's a wooden trellis that kind f bows overhead and kind of makes a little roof for it for us I guess
and it 's got all of these flowering plants on it and ivy
and and then we have this big rose garden in front of us
and and then you just have this perfect view of the city .
So you 're actually above the city
what
yeah
right
we 're above the city
we 're on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">mount Scopeth</ENAMEX> which is right next to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the mount Olif</ENAMEX>
and so %um <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> is right below us
it takes <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">about fifteen minutes</ENAMEX> to walk -- Is -- into the old city .
Is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> center on the highest mountain for around there ?
%um it 's
yeah
well pretty close
like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hebrew University</ENAMEX> is just above us .
What 's it called ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hebrew University</ENAMEX> is just right above us
we go there a lot
we have access to all of their stuff %um their library and everything like that
but %um
And who who 's that done by ?
who
a University
%um I think it is just a state university you know
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> %huh ?
yeah
%ah well
no
I mean the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>
yeah
ca-
I think that 's who runs it
but %um there 's a lot of people worldwide that are there
%huh
I 'm sorry
I 'm like trying to wake up
Well I thought
I guess I was an hour off
I thought it 'd be just about <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">seven o'clock</ENAMEX>
and you 'd be wide awake by now
but You are now
I am now
we we have tomorrow off too
oh do you
what 's nice is we have like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</ENAMEX> of classes and and then we have %um <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</ENAMEX> off
it 's weird though because it 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> over there now %huh ?
yeah
it is
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> night
see we have our <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> our Sabbath on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX>
and so it it 's so easy to get confused with days
I 'm just I forget what day it is because it just it just messes me up because Sundays you know we go out and go on field trips and everything like that
and anyways it 's confusing
But oh I 'm taking my <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaiah</ENAMEX> class
so wonderful
it 's so good .
At what ti-
I love it
What time do you normally start classes
%um at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">about seven forty</ENAMEX>
At <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">seven forty</ENAMEX>
yeah
we have %um we have our <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Testament</ENAMEX> class in the morning every morning at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">seven forty</ENAMEX>
And then I usually have I usually have
%um I 'm that class is a lot
actually we study a lot down here
Surprisingly enough
but %um I have my <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Testament</ENAMEX> class
and then I go to do either %um N E S Near Eastern Civilizations
%um it 's really good
Brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> teaches it
and he
What is it
N N E S
uh-huh
Near Eastern Near Eastern Studies
What does that stand for
I said Near Eastern Civilizations
that 's not right
No that 's a C
so
what is it
Studies Near Eastern Studies
Near Eastern Studies
that 's what it is
okay you 'll have to give me a break because I 'm a little tired
Anyway %um that 's a really cool class because they you get to learn all the history behind everything
And it starts making things in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> make sense you know
oh yeah
you know you find out
oh okay I understand you know okay when this happened when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham</ENAMEX> was journeying and What was going on politically in the area what was going on culturally in the area
and all of a sudden the stories kind of make sense
And it just they just come to life you know
it 's really neat
I like it a lot
and then I have %um then I have %um my <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> Culture class %um taught by rabbi <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX>
he 's really really good really good teacher %um
and %ah tha- that 's been interesting to to learn about
yeah
Does he speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> pretty well
yeah
actually he 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX>
and he speaks with this really cool <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> accent
I love listening to him talk
he uses all of these %um cool words
and in his <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> accident accent it just it just kind of sounds kind of neat
he 's an he 's a neat figure
he 's really %um energetic
and anyway %um he %ah
and then there 's this <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> Civilization class that I take from %um from Brother
he 's an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> here a very prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> %um <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslim</ENAMEX> down here
he really was influential in %um getting the center built here
he worked with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter</ENAMEX> a lot that knew him very well
he is so neat
and I wrote I wrote this in my letter so you 'll get it twice
but %um he was talking to us one time in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of our classes
and he was saying %um somebody asked him
he 's known as a dry <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mormon</ENAMEX> down here
and so somebody asked him kind of what that meant
and and he said he just started
he kind of laughed
and he started going on about how he first came in contact with the church and President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter</ENAMEX>
and and %uh he said
and he just started getting all he got all choked up you know and started to cry
and %ah he you know had to stop and kind of excuse himself
but he said %um he said that he said that he always felt like in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islam</ENAMEX> they believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX> was a prophet %hm And they believe in all the other prophets that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Old Testament</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the New Testament</ENAMEX> you know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> was a prophet
an-
anyway
but they believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX> was the last prophet you know
and so he was the seal of the prophet
they do n't worship em him or anything
and it 's funny because I learn about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> religion and it 's the same thing
you see all of these divisions happening and all of these questions
and you ask
you know there 's the old joke %um if you ask %ah <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> men a question you 'll get <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> opinions
You know tha-
I mean they 're just they 're very you know
you you really do
I 've talked to several of them
you really get different things because you know there 's the ultra orthodox and the reformed and the anyway %um
and so he was just saying that %ah he never thought that that was right
and he said when I %um whenever I am with your prophet President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter</ENAMEX> I he says I can not explain it
it 's just a feeling inside
and then he 'd say do you know what I mean
and we were all just silent you know and and just nodding our heads
and he says yup he says I just can not help but feel that that this is a man of God
