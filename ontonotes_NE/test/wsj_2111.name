<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> Firms Push Posh Car Showrooms
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">JAPANESE</ENAMEX> luxury - car makers are trying to set strict design standards for their dealerships .
But some dealers are negotiating looser terms , while others decline to deal at all .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan Motor Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Infiniti</ENAMEX> division likes to insist that every dealer construct and furnish a building in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> style .
Specifications include a polished bronze sculpture at the center of each showroom and a tile bridge spanning a stream that flows into the building from outside .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Infiniti</ENAMEX> has it down to the ashtrays , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Ferron</ENAMEX> , a partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">J.D. Power -AMP- Associates</ENAMEX> , an auto research firm .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota Motor Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> division also provides specifications .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two - thirds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> dealers are constructing new buildings according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> specs .
Some are even coming up with their own novel designs .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ky.</ENAMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Peterson</ENAMEX> has built a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> dealership with the showroom on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> floor .
Yet some dealers have turned down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Infiniti</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> franchises because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Seidman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Infiniti</ENAMEX> `` was a bear on interiors '' but at least let him retrofit an existing building -- without the stream .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seidman</ENAMEX> says he turned down a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> franchise in part because `` the building was gorgeous but very expensive . ''
To head off arguments , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Infiniti</ENAMEX> offers dealers cash bonuses and low - interest construction loans .
Dictation Device 's Saga Plays Back a Lesson
PRODUCTS DON'T have to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> to be winners .
That 's the lesson offered through <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> case study featured in a design exhibit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dictaphone Corp.</ENAMEX> was caught off guard in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</ENAMEX> when its main competitor , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lanier Office Products of Japan</ENAMEX> , introduced a microcassette dictation recorder <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> the size of standard cassette devices .
Blocked by patent protection from following suit , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dictaphone</ENAMEX> decided to go a step further and cut the cassette in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> again -- down to the length of a paperclip .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</ENAMEX> , designers and engineers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dictaphone</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pitney Bowes</ENAMEX> subsidiary , had produced a working model of a `` picocassette '' recorder .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> , however , the patent status of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lanier</ENAMEX> microcassette had changed , permitting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dictaphone</ENAMEX> to develop its own competitive micro system , which it did .
Marketing and sales departments then urged abandonment of the pico project .
But others said pico should proceed .
Both were right .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dictaphone</ENAMEX> went ahead and introduced the pico in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> , but it has n't sold well .
To date , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emil Jachmann</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dictaphone</ENAMEX> vice president , it has `` broken even or shown a small loss . ''
Nevertheless , the device has been successful in other ways .
It helped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dictaphone</ENAMEX> attract better engineers , and it provided new technology for other company products .
The picocassette recorder also helped transform the company 's reputation from follower to leading - edge innovator .
`` It gave me great pride to see the inventor of the microcassette in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> look at the pico and shake his head and say ` unbelievable , ' '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jachmann</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dictaphone</ENAMEX> 's picocassette recorder is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</ENAMEX> case studies in the TRIAD Design Project , sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Design Management Institute of Boston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvard Business School</ENAMEX> .
The studies are on exhibit at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</ENAMEX> and will travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Institute of Design</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of California at Berkeley</ENAMEX> .
A Rake 's Progress Means Branching Out
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ONE</ENAMEX> DAY <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Barrett</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mobile</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala.</ENAMEX> , was raking some sycamore leaves , but the rake kept riding up over the piles .
The harder he tried to push them into large piles , the closer he came to breaking the rake and straining his back .
So Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrett</ENAMEX> , then vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Alabama Steamship Association</ENAMEX> , took a steel - toothed garden rake and taped it to the underside of a leaf rake <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about nine inches</ENAMEX> up .
His crude device worked : The lower teeth gathered the leaves into a pile , while the higher , harder teeth moved the top of the pile .
Now incorporated into a polypropylene rake , the <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four - inch</ENAMEX> prongs , or `` wonderbars , '' also are supposed to aid in picking up leaves .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> customer , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Blaggs</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mobile</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the Barrett Rake</ENAMEX> allowed him to do his lawn in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2 1/2 hours</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</ENAMEX> less than usual .
But other rake makers have their doubts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Mason</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ames Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Parkersburg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">W. Va.</ENAMEX> , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrett</ENAMEX> rake `` makes sense , '' but it would be `` tough '' to explain to consumers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Stoner</ENAMEX> , marketing director for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">True Temper Corp.</ENAMEX> , a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Black -AMP- Decker</ENAMEX> , says people do n't want to move a leaf pile .
`` They either pick it up , '' he says , `` or they start pulling from a fresh direction . ''
Odds and Ends
NO MORE STUBBED toes or bruised shins , promises <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Geste Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Goshen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ind.</ENAMEX> , the designer of a bed support to replace traditional frames .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</ENAMEX> tubular steel `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bedfellows</ENAMEX> , '' each roughly in the shape of a `` W , '' are attached to the bottom of the box spring in a recessed position ... .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly half</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> consumers say they 'll pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 5 %</ENAMEX> more for packaging that can be recycled or is biodegradable , according to a survey commissioned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Michael Peters Group</ENAMEX> , a design consultant .
