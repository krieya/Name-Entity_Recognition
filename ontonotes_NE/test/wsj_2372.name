The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> 's decision to approve a bare - bones deficit - reduction bill without a capital - gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of enacting a gains tax reduction <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Late Friday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> voted <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87 - 7</ENAMEX> to approve an <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">estimated $ 13.5 billion</ENAMEX> measure that had been stripped of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of provisions that would have widened , rather than narrowed , the federal budget deficit .
Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special - interest tax breaks and spending increases .
`` We 're putting a deficit - reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit - reduction bill , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate Budget Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Sasser</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenn .</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital - gains tax cut .
In addition , the companion deficit - reduction bill already passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> includes a capital - gains provision .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - Senate negotiations are likely to begin at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">midweek</ENAMEX> and last for a while .
`` No one can predict exactly what will happen on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> side , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> Minority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dole</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kan .</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
But , he added , `` I believe <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> will work together to get capital - gains reform <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> Budget Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman</ENAMEX> told reporters <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> that the administration would n't push to keep the capital - gains cut in the final version of the bill .
`` We do n't need this as a way to get capital gains , '' he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House Budget Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Panetta</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif .</ENAMEX> -RRB- said in an interview , `` If that 's the signal that comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> , that will help a great deal . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> 's decision was a setback for President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and will make approval of a capital - gains tax cut less certain <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
Opponents of the cut are playing hardball .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> -RRB- said he was `` confident '' that any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - Senate agreement on the deficit - reduction legislation would n't include a capital - gains tax cut .
And a senior aide to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> , where tax legislation originates , said there are n't any `` plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> obvious place to attach a capital - gains tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit - reduction bill , is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit .
Such legislation must be enacted by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit - reduction through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> .
Because the legislation has n't been completed , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has until <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight tonight</ENAMEX> to enact across - the - board spending cuts mandated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm - Rudman</ENAMEX> deficit - reduction law .
Senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> to agree to the streamlined bill .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> appears reluctant to join the senators .
A key is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> are willing to acquiesce to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions .
`` Although I am encouraged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> action , '' said Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ill .</ENAMEX> -RRB- of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> , `` it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> . ''
Another big question hovering over the debate is what President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> thinks .
He has been resisting a stripped - down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital - gains tax cut .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</ENAMEX> votes needed to win the capital - gains issue on the floor , so they went ahead with the streamlined bill .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> bill was stripped of many popular , though revenue - losing , provisions , a number of which are included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - passed bill .
These include a child - care initiative and extensions of soon - to - expire tax breaks for low - income housing and research - and - development expenditures .
Also missing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> bill is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> 's repeal of a law , called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 89</ENAMEX> , that compels companies to give rank - and - file workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> high - profile provision that was originally in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> -RRB- of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX> said he hopes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> will consider that measure soon .
To the delight of some doctors , the bill dropped a plan passed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Finance Committee</ENAMEX> that would have overhauled the entire physician - reimbursement system under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Medicare</ENAMEX> .
To the detriment of many low - income people , efforts to boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Medicaid</ENAMEX> funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken .
Asked why senators were giving up so much , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Domenici</ENAMEX> , the ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Budget Committee</ENAMEX> , said , `` We 're looking like idiots .
Things had just gone too far . ''
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> said that the move required sacrifice by every senator .
It worked , others said , because there were no exceptions : all revenue - losing provisions were stricken .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> also dropped a plan by its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Finance Committee</ENAMEX> that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefits reduced .
In addition , the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</ENAMEX> excise tax on long - distance telephone calls .
It no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed - contract method of accounting , which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden .
It also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current retirees .
Also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</ENAMEX> penalties , which would have raised <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 65 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> .
A provision that would have made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Social Security Administration</ENAMEX> an independent agency was excised .
The approval of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> bill was especially sweet for Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> , who had proposed the streamlining .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> 's relations with Budget Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> , who pushed for a capital - gains cut to be added to the measure , have been strained since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> chose to bypass the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> and deal with other lawmakers <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> during a dispute over drug funding in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1989</ENAMEX> supplemental spending bill .
The deficit reduction bill contains <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.3 billion</ENAMEX> in tax increases in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26 billion</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> .
The revenue - raising provisions , which affect mostly corporations , would :
-- Prevent companies that have made leveraged buy - outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the buy - outs , effective <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 2 , 1989</ENAMEX> .
-- Require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the date</ENAMEX> that the dividends are declared rather than received , effective <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> after the tax bill is enacted .
-- Close a loophole regarding employee stock ownership plans , effective <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 6 , 1989</ENAMEX> , that has been exploited by investment bankers in corporate takeovers .
The measure repeals a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an ESOP , if the ESOP owns <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 30 %</ENAMEX> of the employer 's stock .
-- Curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securities , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</ENAMEX> - coupon bonds , that postpone cash interest payments .
-- Raise <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 851 million</ENAMEX> by suspending for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</ENAMEX> an automatic reduction in airport and airway taxes .
-- Speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies , effective <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1990</ENAMEX> .
-- Impose a tax on ozone - depleting chemicals , such as those used in air conditioners and in Styrofoam , beginning at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.10</ENAMEX> a pound starting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
-- Withhold income taxes from the paychecks of certain farm workers currently exempt from withholding .
-- Change the collection of gasoline excise taxes to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">semimonthly</ENAMEX> , effective <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
-- Restrict the ability of real estate owners to escape taxes by swapping <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash .
-- Increase to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">6</ENAMEX> a person from $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3</ENAMEX> the international air - passenger departure tax , and impose a $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3</ENAMEX> - a - person tax on international departures by commercial ships .
The measure also includes spending cuts and increases in federal fees .
Among its provisions :
-- Reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Medicare</ENAMEX> spending in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 2.8 billion</ENAMEX> , in part by curbing increases in reimbursements to physicians .
The plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
-- Removal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Postal Service 's</ENAMEX> operating budget from the federal budget , reducing the deficit by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.77 billion</ENAMEX> .
A similar provision is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> version .
-- Authority for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> to raise <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 239 million</ENAMEX> by charging fees for commercial airline - landing rights at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">LaGuardia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">John F. Kennedy International Airports</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">O'Hare International Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">National Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
-- Increases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</ENAMEX> fees totaling <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 54 million</ENAMEX> .
-- Direction to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Coast Guard</ENAMEX> to collect <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</ENAMEX> from users of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> services .
