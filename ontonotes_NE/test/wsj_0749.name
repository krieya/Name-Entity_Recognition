In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Presidents Commission</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NCAA</ENAMEX> , which oversees most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> intercollegiate sports , contracted with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Institutes for Research</ENAMEX> to do a survey on the college experiences of what the body chooses to call student - athletes .
A brief `` executive summary '' was issued <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last April</ENAMEX> , and attracted some , but not much , attention .
More - detailed reports followed , and attracted even less notice .
I suspect I may be one of the few people to have read them all .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</ENAMEX> and last report now is out , and it puts the effort in perspective .
Titled `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Comments From Students</ENAMEX> , '' it focuses on the real shame of college sports : what happens to young athletes once they enter academe .
It 's little less than a cry for help from those who make the costly show possible .
The previous <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> reports were mainly statistical , but clear enough in outline .
They showed that participants in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Division I</ENAMEX> football and men 's basketball , the big - time `` revenue sports , '' entered school with poorer high - school grades and test scores than `` minor - sport '' jocks and students who participated in other extracurricular activities , and they got lower grades once they got there , at least partly because of the athletic demands placed on them .
The football and basketball players spent more time on their sports in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">season</ENAMEX> than they did on class attendance and homework combined -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">30 hours</ENAMEX> a week versus <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25.3</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Almost half</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49.8 %</ENAMEX> -RRB- reported suffering `` mental abuse '' from coaches , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost one - quarter</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.8 %</ENAMEX> -RRB- said they had been pressured to ignore injuries .
But even those numbers do n't describe the situation as well as the athletes do in their own words .
The composite portrait that emerges is n't of a pampered jock marking time until he can land a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> - figure pro contract -- he 's part of a tiny minority .
Rather , it 's of a kid -LRB- we 're talking about <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">17 to 22 year olds</ENAMEX> here -RRB- having a tough time making the best of what will probably be his <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> shot at college .
The pertinent question , coming at the end of a lengthy , confidential questionnaire , was this : `` Are there things about your college life you would like to tell us that we did n't ask about ? ''
Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 3,000</ENAMEX> athletes surveyed , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,240</ENAMEX> took the time to respond .
Here are a few of their answers : -- `` They say that I am a student - athlete , but really I 'm an athlete - student .
They lied to me on the recruiting trip .
Football is the No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> thing here '' .
-- Junior football player .
-- `` Being a student - athlete at college is a lot different from high school .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , the sport you play is no longer a game -- it becomes a job .
Your coaches demand a lot more out of you even though some of them are not willing to take the time to watch you progress .
You become expendable .
Your interest is not taken to heart because people only care about your performance '' .
-- Freshman basketball player .
-- `` The coaches should have a more personal and sympathetic attitude toward the athletes -- not treat us like pieces of meat .
They always say to get a degree <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> , but they do n't allow us time or to skip practice to study for a test .
They just want to get their job done at any cost to the athlete '' .
-- Freshman football player .
-- `` The pressure put on us to win at all times has resulted in physical violence , such as punching and slapping by coaches .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Some days</ENAMEX> the coaches make you feel as though you are part of a large herd of animals .
In other words , they treat you like a piece of meat '' .
-- Sophomore football player .
-- `` Playing intercollegiate sports does n't give you a lot of time to spend with others .
We are almost left out of -LCB- campus -RCB- social activities .
This mostly happens because we go from football in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall</ENAMEX> to lifting in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</ENAMEX> to football again in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</ENAMEX> '' .
-- Freshman football player .
-- `` You talk about free time -- .what free time ?
Time to relax and enjoy ourselves is always taken up by something to do with football -LRB- meetings , lifting weights , conditioning or films -RRB- .
There is no recovery period -- it 's go , go , go .
ABUSE to our bodies is overwhelming .
With our schedule , it 's hard to sleep well knowing what is going to happen <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</ENAMEX> '' .
-- Junior football player .
-- `` Physical exhaustion and depression are common in my life and in some of my teammates ' lives '' .
-- Football player , class unspecified .
-- `` More often than not , college athletes go through college never really experiencing collegiate life to the fullest .
One has to establish one 's own identity away from athletics and make athletics only a part , not a whole , of the student - athlete 's life '' .
-- Sophomore basketball player .
-- `` Somehow , and I do n't know how , the game needs to be played for fun again , and not for the big bowl revenues or lucrative TV contracts '' .
-- Graduate - student football player .
There have been rumblings that , at long last , changes may be in the works .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Knight Foundation</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Akron</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , has established a national commission to look into college - sports reform , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the NCAA Presidents Commission</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this month</ENAMEX> recommended cutting spring football practice in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> , moving the start of basketball practice back by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</ENAMEX> and reducing maximum schedules in that sport to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</ENAMEX> games from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</ENAMEX> .
The key word in that paragraph , though , is `` may . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NCAA</ENAMEX> Executive Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Schultz</ENAMEX> , in accepting a place on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Knight Commission</ENAMEX> , urged that the panel take a `` balanced '' view , which looks for all the world like a plea not to rock the boat too much , and the presidents ' recommendations could face considerable opposition at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NCAA</ENAMEX> 's full convention in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> , which will vote on them .
I read that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> unnamed athletics director predicted that the basketball - cutback proposal could fail because of `` real world '' -LRB- i.e. , economic -RRB- considerations .
But the `` real world '' also includes the unpleasant truth that colleges are cheating the athletes they have wooed and won .
If they wo n't change their ways voluntarily , maybe somebody bigger -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> -- should make them .
