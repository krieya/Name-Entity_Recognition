Hopes for quick enactment of pending deficit - reduction legislation faded as efforts to streamline the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> version in advance of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - Senate conference broke down .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> leaders had hoped to follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> 's lead by getting an agreement from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> committee chairmen under which they would drop items that would n't reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> budget deficit from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - passed bill before the negotiations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> began .
But the effort became snagged on the question of what would become of other issues , ranging from cutting the capital - gains tax to child care to repeal of catastrophic - illness insurance .
`` Many members feel there are important features of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> bill that should be enacted , '' Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Foley</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wash .</ENAMEX> -RRB- said .
`` If there is any support for reducing the bill , it is conditioned on their desire to see them passed in another form . ''
Now those items will be discussed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - Senate conference , which could begin as soon as <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , with the expectation that they could either be resolved there or placed into other legislation .
`` You 've got to give these chairmen the opportunity to see if they can work things out , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House Budget Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Panetta</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif .</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
`` This is a democratic process -- you ca n't slam - dunk anything around here . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> Budget Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman</ENAMEX> has said he would continue to press to keep the capital - gains provision in the final version of the bill unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> drops many of its costly provisions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> leaders had hoped to be able to send a compromise version of the measure to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the week</ENAMEX> , but Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> said that was n't likely .
Failure to pass the bill meant that <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16.1 billion</ENAMEX> in across - the - board spending cuts took effect <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm - Rudman</ENAMEX> budget law .
The bill must be enacted before the cuts can be restored .
