<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> is planning a big coming - out party on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> line of mainframe computers .
But an uninvited guest is expected to try to crash the party .
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> of the long - planned announcement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> is to introduce its own new mainframe .
`` Their attitude is , ` You want to talk mainframes , we 'll talk mainframes , ' '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> computer industry executive .
`` They 're deliberately trying to steal our thunder , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> executive complains .
`` Maybe we should take it as a compliment . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> 's target is the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 billion</ENAMEX> market for mainframe computers , the closet - sized number - crunchers that nearly every big company needs to run its business .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armonk</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , has dominated the market for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</ENAMEX> .
That does n't scare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> , which has grown to be the world 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> - largest computer maker by poaching customers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> 's mid-range machines .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maynard</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , hopes to stage a repeat performance in mainframes , and it has spent <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 1 billion</ENAMEX> developing the new technology .
A spoiler , nimble <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tandem Computers Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cupertino</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , jumped into the fray <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this week</ENAMEX> with an aggressively priced entry .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> appears more worried about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> , which has a broad base of customers waiting for the new line , dubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the VAX 9000</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's going to be nuclear war , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Willmott</ENAMEX> , a consultant with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Aberdeen Group Inc</ENAMEX> .
The surge in competition is expected to stir new life into the huge mainframe market , where growth has slowed to single digits in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> 's traditional mainframe rivals , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Unisys Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Control Data Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NCR Corp.</ENAMEX> , have struggled recently .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> is promising a new approach .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M. Glorioso</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> 's vice president for high performance systems , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> 's mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything revolves , but as part of a decentralized network weaving together <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of workstations , personal computers , printers and other devices .
And unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> 's water - cooled mainframes , it does n't need any plumbing .
The challengers will have a big price advantage .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> is expected to tag its new line from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.24 million to $ 4.4 million</ENAMEX> and up , depending on configuration .
That 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</ENAMEX> the price of comparably equipped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> mainframes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tandem</ENAMEX> 's pricing is just as aggressive .
The heightened competition will hit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> at a difficult time .
The computer giant 's current mainframe line , which has sold well and has huge profit margins , is starting to show its age .
The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3090s</ENAMEX> due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> will boost performance by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 8 % to 10 %</ENAMEX> .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> is n't expected to deliver a new generation of mainframes until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> .
Still , no one expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> 's rivals to deliver a knockout .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> has a near - monopoly on mainframes , with an estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</ENAMEX> share of the market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> times the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</ENAMEX> times the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tandem</ENAMEX> -- and wields enormous market power .
It counts among its customers a majority of the world 's largest corporations , which entrust their most critical business information to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> computers .
`` We 're not going to walk in and replace a company 's corporate accounting system if it 's already running on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> mainframe , '' concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth H. Olsen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> 's president .
He says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> will target faster - growing market segments such as on - line transaction processing , which includes retail - sales tracking , airline reservations and bank - teller networks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tandem</ENAMEX> , which already specializes in on - line transaction processing , is a potent competitor in that market .
A key marketing target for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> will be the large number of big customers who already own both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> systems .
One such company is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bankers Trust Co</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Rose</ENAMEX> , a vice president , technological and strategic planning at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bankers Trust</ENAMEX> , says that despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> 's low prices , `` we are n't about to unplug our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> mainframes for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DEC</ENAMEX> machine .
The software conversion costs would dwarf any savings . ''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> is still looking seriously at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9000</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bankers Trust</ENAMEX> uses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VAX</ENAMEX> to run its huge money - transfer and capital markets accounts , juggling <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of billions of dollars</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</ENAMEX> , he says .
As that system grows , larger computers may be needed .
`` In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</ENAMEX> , customers had to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> when they outgrew the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VAX</ENAMEX> .
Now they do n't have to , '' he says .
`` That 's going to cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> revenue . ''
Analysts say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> can expect this pent - up demand for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VAX</ENAMEX> to fuel strong sales <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry F. Willman</ENAMEX> , an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sanford C. Bernstein -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , estimates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9000</ENAMEX> could boost sales by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fiscal year</ENAMEX> beginning in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> .
He bases the estimate on a survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> 's largest customers .
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> will announce a full family of mainframes <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> , it is n't expected to begin shipping in volume until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> model available will be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">210</ENAMEX> , which is likely to appeal to many technical and scientific buyers interested in the optional super-charger , or vector processor , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Shannon</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Data Corp.</ENAMEX> , a market research concern .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</ENAMEX> more models , aimed squarely at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> 's commercial customers , are expected to begin shipping in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late June</ENAMEX> .
Most analysts do n't expect the new mainframes to begin contributing significantly to revenue before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fiscal first quarter</ENAMEX> , which begins <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next July 1</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> 's new line has been a long time coming .
The company has long struggled to deliver a strong mainframe - class product , and made a costly decision in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> to halt development of an interim product meant to stem the revenue losses at the high end .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> 's failure to deliver a true mainframe - class machine before now may have cost the company as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> in revenue in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1989</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willman</ENAMEX> says .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> will face still more competition in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">coming months</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Amdahl Corp.</ENAMEX> , backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fujitsu Ltd.</ENAMEX> , has a growing share of the market with its low - priced , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> - compatible machines .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Advanced Systems</ENAMEX> , a joint venture of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hitachi Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Motors Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Electronic Data Systems</ENAMEX> , is expected to unveil a line of powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> - compatible mainframes <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">later this year</ENAMEX> .
