Legal controversies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> have a way of assuming a symbolic significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case .
They speak volumes about the state of our society at a given moment .
It has always been so .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</ENAMEX> , a young schoolteacher , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John T. Scopes</ENAMEX> , volunteered to be a guinea pig in a test case sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the American Civil Liberties Union</ENAMEX> to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Legislature</ENAMEX> .
The result was a world - famous trial exposing profound cultural conflicts in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> life between the `` smart set , '' whose spokesman was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.L. Mencken</ENAMEX> , and the religious fundamentalists , whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mencken</ENAMEX> derided as benighted primitives .
Few now recall the actual outcome : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scopes</ENAMEX> was convicted and fined $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">100</ENAMEX> , and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive under <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> law .
So it was with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiss</ENAMEX> case <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a generation later</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alger Hiss</ENAMEX> became a lightning rod for the anxieties of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Cold War</ENAMEX> and conflicting attitudes toward the New Deal he had served .
His trials aroused public passions out of all proportion to the rather banal secrets he allegedly had passed to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> intelligence .
And so it seems to be with the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Morgan</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> , plastic surgeon jailed in a child custody case for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her daughter .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> has just emerged from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> jail after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than two years '</ENAMEX> confinement for contempt of court , a heroine to her many supporters .
To the rest of us , the case is a puzzle .
It is what lawyers call `` fact intensive . ''
It presents no great issue of legal principle , no overriding question of family law or the law of contempt .
Instead , it turns on the disputed and elusive facts of `` who did what to whom . ''
It is difficult , if not impossible , for anyone who has not pored over the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of pages of court pleadings and transcripts to have a worthwhile opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy .
Certainly I do not .
So we must look elsewhere for an explanation of the unusual power this case has exerted over the minds of many , not just in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> but elsewhere in the country and even the world .
I suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> themes have come together in the strange case of Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> is that it represents an intense battle in what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Thurber</ENAMEX> used to caricature as `` the war between the sexes . ''
But although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurber</ENAMEX> did so gently and lightheartedly , many of Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> 's supporters have taken <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurber</ENAMEX> 's memorable title `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Male Animal</ENAMEX> '' quite literally .
The vehemence of the emotions aroused by the case testifies to its symbolic importance in the war that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurber</ENAMEX> accepted as an eternal part of the human condition .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> theme is the undercurrent of social class and race in the public reaction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> case .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the `` best '' schools .
As members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Black Caucus</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> asked during the debate on the legislation that freed Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> , does anyone seriously believe that if she were an uneducated , black , working - class woman , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> would have rushed to pass a private relief bill freeing her ?
Or that the president would have hurried to sign the bill `` out of compassion for her plight '' ?
To ask those questions is to answer them .
Finally , the case of Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">District of Columbia</ENAMEX> government .
The local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons , and congressmen read the same newspapers and watch the same TV newscasts as other people in the area do .
Bashing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> government is risk - free for members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> , who do not have to answer to their own constituents for it .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> is paralyzed from acting on such great issues of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> as the federal budget deficit .
Yet a bill tailored to the interests of a single individual passed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> with almost unimaginable speed , before the judicial process had run its course , and , indeed , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> case was awaiting a ruling by the appellate court .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex , class , race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> 's particular situation .
It may stand as a metaphor for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rezneck</ENAMEX> is a lawyer in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C</ENAMEX> .
