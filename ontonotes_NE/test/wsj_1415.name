A bill that would permit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> to monitor the financial condition of securities firms ' holding companies is facing tough opposition from some Wall Street firms , which argue that the legislation is unnecessary .
The legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Securities Subcommittee</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> , the new chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> , has n't taken a formal position on the bill , which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> additional authority during market emergencies .
However , he recently told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Banking Committee</ENAMEX> that he believes the agency should have explicit authority to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of broker - dealers , which are frequently used to issue bridge loans .
The bridge loans are intended to provide temporary financing for acquisitions .
Since such loans are often refinanced through the sale of high - risk , high - yield junk bonds , the recent woes of the junk - bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated with Wall Street firms issuing bridge loans .
But some Wall Street executives argue that such fears are unwarranted .
In a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July 6</ENAMEX> letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Securities Subcommittee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Boston</ENAMEX> , whose holding company , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CS First Boston Group</ENAMEX> , is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on Wall Street , said it is also concerned that once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> has the power to monitor holding companies , it will try to regulate their activities .
`` The proposal , while well - intended , I think can be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken , rather than strengthen the control the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> has exercised for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</ENAMEX> over the financial adequacy and viability of broker - dealers , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Raoul - Duval</ENAMEX> , managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Boston</ENAMEX> , said in an interview .
The bill would `` divert scarce resources of the commission away from broker - dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker - dealers , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raoul - Duval</ENAMEX> said .
Sources in the industry and on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> say a compromise that would placate the industry while addressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> 's concerns may be possible .
An aide to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Securities Subcommittee</ENAMEX> says some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure , but adds : `` nobody is wedded to the language in the bill . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward O'Brien</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Securities Industry Association</ENAMEX> , said that the securities - industry trade group opposes the bill as it is written but that it is `` hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> 's goals . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Brien</ENAMEX> will elaborate on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SIA</ENAMEX> 's position in testimony before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> , a spokesman said .
