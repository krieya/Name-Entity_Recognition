<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parliament</ENAMEX> Member <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mishaan Al - Jubouri</ENAMEX> , Head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Reconciliation and Liberation Block</ENAMEX> , said that the political process has died and should be buried .
This came in an interview with one of the satellite channels .
He also described the current and previous governments as sectarian and exclusive governments that kill <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> and assist the militias in doing so .
He also described <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Maliki</ENAMEX> as the most exclusive person , whose motto is murder , then murder , then murder , and he was responsible for the military office of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dawa party</ENAMEX> , which is killing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> .
He noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Maliki</ENAMEX> had told him , " Let the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> go as refugees outside the country for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> and then let them come for us to reconcile with them . "
As for the reconciliation project that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Maliki</ENAMEX> has announced , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mishaan</ENAMEX> said this project has no basis in fact and that what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Maliki</ENAMEX> did was only to satisfy the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> and trick certain politicians , and that his establishment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Anbar Militias</ENAMEX> , who strive to kill the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Anbar</ENAMEX> , is nothing but proof of this .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mishaan Al - Jubouri</ENAMEX> accused <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moqtada Al Sadr</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mahdi Army militia</ENAMEX> of killing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> and of being behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sadr</ENAMEX> city explosions , with help from an outside party , in reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> .
He said that there was a committee of lawmakers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brussels</ENAMEX> that was gathering evidence on the crimes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moqtada Al Sadr</ENAMEX> and his militias .
It is worth noting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mishaan Al - Jubouri 's</ENAMEX> immunity was withdrawn due to accusations of corruption from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Government Integrity Committee</ENAMEX> , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Reconciliation and Liberation Party</ENAMEX> which he chairs had withdrawn from the government .
