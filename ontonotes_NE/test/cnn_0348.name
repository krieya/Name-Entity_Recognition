As we told you at the top of this newscast , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> judge has ruled that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Nichols</ENAMEX> will indeed stand trial in that state court on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</ENAMEX> counts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> - degree murder .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> bombing conspirator is already serving a life term in federal prison .
State proceedings could bring the death penalty if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nichols</ENAMEX> is convicted .

<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> a silent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dee Ana Laney</ENAMEX> waited as the judge read the charges against her , capital murder and aggravated assault .

What happened ?
They were collecting evidence as you were there , the law enforcement authorities ?
