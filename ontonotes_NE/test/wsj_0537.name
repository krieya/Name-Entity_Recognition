After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">days</ENAMEX> of intense but fruitless negotiations , a federal judge <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> threatened to convert <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Herbert Hunt 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> personal bankruptcy case into a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 7</ENAMEX> liquidation .
Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold C. Abramson</ENAMEX> raised the possibility after talks to end a feud between <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> major creditors failed and all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> reorganization plans in the case ran into roadblocks .
If the case is converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 7</ENAMEX> , what remains of the oil tycoon 's once - vast estate -- now believed to have a value of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 125 million</ENAMEX> -- would be sold off quickly with most of the proceeds going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> , whose claim for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 million</ENAMEX> in back taxes has priority in the case .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</ENAMEX> of smaller creditors could get nothing , according to attorneys involved .
While admitting such a move would be `` devastating '' to most creditors , Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abramson</ENAMEX> told a courtroom filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly two dozen</ENAMEX> attorneys that he was concerned about the toll mounting legal bills will take on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> 's shrinking estate and about the fact that , following voting by creditors , none of the reorganization plans appeared to be viable in their present form .
`` It would be a shame to have <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">a Chapter 7</ENAMEX> after all the progress in this case , '' said Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abramson</ENAMEX> .
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Federal Bankruptcy Code</ENAMEX> , a company continues to operate under protection from creditors ' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts .
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 7</ENAMEX> , the assets of a company are sold off to pay creditors .
Despite his reluctance to take the latter step , the judge indicated he would move quickly after hearing testimony <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">later this week</ENAMEX> in the bitter dispute between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minpeco S.A.</ENAMEX> , a minerals concern owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Peruvian</ENAMEX> governmemt .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ENAMEX> unit , which is seeking repayment of a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 36 million</ENAMEX> loan , has asked the court to give its claim priority over that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minpeco</ENAMEX> , which won a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 132 million</ENAMEX> judgment against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> , his brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Bunker Hunt</ENAMEX> and other defendants <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> in a case stemming from their alleged attempts to corner the silver market in
While claiming that penalties , legal fees and interest have driven the value of its claim to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 250 million</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minpeco</ENAMEX> has agreed to settle for an allowed claim of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 65.7 million</ENAMEX> .
But even that is disputed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> which , in alliance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> , contends that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minpeco</ENAMEX> has already collected more than its actual damages from other defendants in the silver - conspiracy case .
Under prodding from Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abramson</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minpeco</ENAMEX> executive flew in from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> to talk directly with executives from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> on a settlement .
Despite long private sessions in both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides ended <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,000 miles</ENAMEX> and many dollars apart , '' according to attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Ray</ENAMEX> , who represents <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , inside the courtroom , the judge said he would fine attorneys for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> creditors $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">50</ENAMEX> every time they referred to each other with terms such as `` liar '' or `` slime . ''
All <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> major creditors -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minpeco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> -- voted against and effectively doomed a reorganization plan proposed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> .
A reorganization plan proposed jointly by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> was stalled by a negative vote from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minpeco</ENAMEX> .
The mineral concern 's own reorganization plan met a similar fate after opposition from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> .
Neither plan is dead , however , and the judge could force creditors to accept some version of them after ruling on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minpeco</ENAMEX> - Manufacturers Hanover dispute .
Meanwhile , settlement negotiations continue between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> , which has already reached a tentative agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Bunker Hunt</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides have been far apart on how much <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Hunt</ENAMEX> will continue to owe the government after his assets are sold .
