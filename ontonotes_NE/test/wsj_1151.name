The stock market 's woes spooked currency traders but prompted a quiet little party among bond investors .
Prices of long - term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds moved inversely to the stock market as investors sought safety amid growing evidence the economy is weakening .
But the shaky economic outlook and the volatile stock market forced the dollar lower against major currencies .
The bond market got an early boost from the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">opening - hour</ENAMEX> sell - off in stocks .
That rout was triggered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL Corp. 's</ENAMEX> announcement <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Monday</ENAMEX> that the proposed management - labor buy - out had collapsed .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</ENAMEX> - point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average during the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> trading session touched off a flight to safety that saw investors shifting assets from stocks to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds .
At its strongest , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond rose more than a point , or <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 10</ENAMEX> for each $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> face amount .
As the stock market recovered some of its losses <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">later in the day</ENAMEX> , bond prices retreated .
But analysts said the combination of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> consecutive decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> durable - goods orders and lackluster <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-October</ENAMEX> auto sales helped prop up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> market .
A slowing economy and the implication of lower inflation and interest rates tend to bolster bond prices .
On the surface , the decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> durable goods -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 0.1 %</ENAMEX> -- did n't appear very weak .
But orders for non-defense capital goods , a precursor of future plant and equipment spending , were off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.6 %</ENAMEX> after falling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.3 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> .
Auto makers reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-October</ENAMEX> sales were running at an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5.8 million</ENAMEX> units , far less than the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.6 million</ENAMEX> units analysts had expected .
Taken together , the auto - sales and durable - goods reports confirmed perceptions that the economy is bogging down .
Although analysts do n't expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to ease credit policy soon , reports like those <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> help build the case for lower rates .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Now</ENAMEX> bond investors are looking toward <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week 's</ENAMEX> report from national purchasing managers and the government 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> employment report as potentially prompting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> to lower rates .
The stock market 's precipitous drop frightened foreign investors , who quickly bid the dollar lower .
But as stock prices recovered some of the early losses , so did the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency .
Although dealers said investors are becoming more bearish toward the dollar in the wake of the stock market 's recent troubles and as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy weakens , the dollar ended down only modestly .
In major market activity : Bond prices rose .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond gained <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</ENAMEX> a point , or <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 5</ENAMEX> for each $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> face amount .
The yield on the issue slipped to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.89 %</ENAMEX> .
The dollar retreated .
In late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> trading the currency was quoted at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8355 marks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.45 yen</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8470 marks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.90 yen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
