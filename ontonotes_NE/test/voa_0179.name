<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Energy</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Richardson</ENAMEX> has extended an emergency order to keep electricity flowing to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> .
The measure will require western suppliers to sell power to the state for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at least another week</ENAMEX> .
As we hear from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Sullivan</ENAMEX> , the official also proposed an energy price cap for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> , but the suggestion had a mixed response from western governors .
The extension of the federal order will require power suppliers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> to keep sending their surplus electricity to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> .
Electrical resources in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West Coast</ENAMEX> state are stretched to their limit with a looming threat of rolling blackouts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's utility companies are not able to generate all the power their customers need , so they have turned to outside suppliers and in the face of rising prices the state 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> largest utility firms have sunk <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than eight billion dollars</ENAMEX> in debt .
Suppliers outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> had threatened to cut off the power , afraid that the cash - strapped utilities were not able to pay for it .
The emergency order <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> and the extension announced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> at a meeting of western governors will keep electricity flowing to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of next week</ENAMEX> .
The crisis began <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> imposed a price freeze on its private utility firms to protect consumers while the state deregulates its energy sector , but the lifting of market controls led to wild price fluctuations on the wholesale market .
This was made worse by several factors .
No new generating stations have been built in the state in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> and some existing generators are offline for repairs .
At the same time <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> has been growing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Energy</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Richardson</ENAMEX> says it is a case of demand outpacing supplies .
I know in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> alone in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last year</ENAMEX> electricity demand has increased <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's wholesale electricity prices , which had been capped at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">250 dollars</ENAMEX> per megawatt hour in a regulated market , have peaked under deregulation at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1400 dollars</ENAMEX> per megawatt hour .
With the current price freeze , utilities have been prevented from passing along the increase to consumers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Energy</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Richardson</ENAMEX> suggested a new price cap for electricity throughout the western states .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> 's Governor supports the idea .
Some other western leaders are not convinced that a price cap will solve the problem .
Energy suppliers oppose a cap , saying instead they need incentives to build more generating stations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> federal regulators imposed a so - called soft cap on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , which requires power firms to justify prices above <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">150 dollars</ENAMEX> per megawatt hour .
The measure does not however prevent them from charging above that level .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> large utility company , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Southern California Edison</ENAMEX> says it may have to file for bankruptcy unless government officials can offer some relief .
The privately owned company is now <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">three and a half billion dollars</ENAMEX> in debt .
Consumer activists are skeptical .
They know the utility recently declared a dividend for its stockholders , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Edison</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Higgins</ENAMEX> says the firm can not continue to pay high prices for electricity while keeping prices low for its customers .
Our books are an open matter .
It 's not hard for anybody to see .
They can talk to the banks themselves and see that you know , clearly we do n't have the ability to do this .
We do n't print money in the basement .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> warned that intermittent cutoffs of power around the state may begin as early as <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> if nothing more is done to alleviate the crisis .
