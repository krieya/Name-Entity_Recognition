The surprise resignation <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> Chancellor of the Exchequer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> sent sterling into a tailspin against the dollar by creating uncertainties about the direction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> economy .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> unit also firmed against other currencies on the back of sterling 's tumble , as market participants switched out of pounds .
The pound also dropped precipitously against the mark , falling below the key <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.90</ENAMEX> - mark level to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.8956 marks</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.9622 marks</ENAMEX> late <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's resignation shocked many analysts , despite the recent recurring speculation of a rift between the chancellor and Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> .
Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">only hours earlier</ENAMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> had called Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's economic policies `` sound '' and said she has `` always supported '' him .
`` There was a general feeling that we 'd seen the worst , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Foley</ENAMEX> , deputy chief economic adviser for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyds Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> .
`` The resignation came as a great surprise . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Beale</ENAMEX> , manager of foreign - exchange operations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hong Kong -AMP- Shanghai Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , added that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's comments reinforced the market 's growing confidence about sterling and compounded the unit 's later decline .
`` The market was caught totally the wrong way ... .
Everyone was extremely long on sterling , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beale</ENAMEX> said .
In late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> trading <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , the dollar was quoted at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8400 marks</ENAMEX> , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8353 marks</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Wednesday</ENAMEX> , and at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.10 yen</ENAMEX> , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.52 yen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Wednesday</ENAMEX> .
Sterling was quoted at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5765</ENAMEX> , sharply down from $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.6145</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Wednesday</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency opened for trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.02 yen</ENAMEX> , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.90 yen</ENAMEX> .
Few analysts had much good to say about the pound 's near - term prospects , despite the fact that most do n't anticipate a shift in Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's economic policies .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyds</ENAMEX> noted that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's replacement , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Major</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> foreign minister , will take time to establish his credibility and , in the meantime , sterling could trend downward in volatile trade .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> predicted few economic policy changes ahead , commenting that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major</ENAMEX> shares `` a very similar view of the world '' with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Chandross</ENAMEX> , chief economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyds Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , also noted that the pound 's sharp decline is pegged more to uncertainty in the market than a vision of altered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> economic policies .
Unless Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's resignation leads to a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> interest - rate policy -- Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's administration firmly supports high interest rates to keep inflation in check -- or posturing toward full inclusion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">European Monetary System 's</ENAMEX> exchange - rate mechanism , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's withdrawal will have little long - term impact on exchange rates , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandross</ENAMEX> concluded .
Also announcing his resignation <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Walters</ENAMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's economic adviser and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's nemesis .
The pound , which had been trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.6143</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> prior to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's announcement , sank <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than two cents</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5930</ENAMEX> , prompting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> to buy pounds for dollars .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> 's move , however , only proved a stopgap to the pound 's slide and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> intervened for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> time at around $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5825</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> traders .
Meanwhile , dollar trading was relatively uninspired throughout the session , according to dealers , who noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> 's release of the preliminary report on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">third - quarter</ENAMEX> gross national product was something of a nonevent .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> GNP rose at an annual rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third quarter</ENAMEX> .
The implicit price deflator , a measure of inflation , was down to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.9 %</ENAMEX> annual rate of increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</ENAMEX> rate of gain in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the second quarter</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , the dollar ended lower in dull trading .
The market closed prior to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's announcement .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , gold for current delivery rose $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.40</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">372.50</ENAMEX> an ounce in heavy trading .
The close was the highest since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August 3</ENAMEX> .
Estimated volume was <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five million ounces</ENAMEX> .
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , gold was quoted at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">370.85</ENAMEX> an ounce .
