The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> stock exchanges are bracing for a turbulent separation , following <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Malaysian</ENAMEX> Finance Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daim Zainuddin</ENAMEX> 's long - awaited announcement that the exchanges will sever ties .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Datuk Daim</ENAMEX> added spice to an otherwise unremarkable address on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> 's proposed budget for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> by ordering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> `` to take appropriate action immediately '' to cut its links with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Stock Exchange of Singapore</ENAMEX> .
The delisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Malaysian</ENAMEX> - based companies from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> exchange may not be a smooth process , analysts say .
Though the split has long been expected , the exchanges are n't fully prepared to go their separate ways .
The finance minister 's order was n't sparked by a single event and does n't indicate a souring in relations between the neighboring countries .
Rather , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> closely linked exchanges have been drifting apart for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">some years</ENAMEX> , with a nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year - old</ENAMEX> moratorium on new dual listings , separate and different listing requirements , differing trading and settlement guidelines and diverging national - policy aims .
