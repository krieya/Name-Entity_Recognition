The market upheaval apparently has n't triggered any cash crunch -- yet .
Individual investors , investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive ; those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans .
But several large banks said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> they detected no signs of unusual demand for credit that would signal such difficulties .
`` We 're seeing nothing out of the ordinary , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> official at a Top <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> bank .
`` That 's good news , because we all swim in this water . ''
Added another executive at a big bank : `` We were all a little goosey over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</ENAMEX> trying to forecast what would happen -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> -RCB- , but it 's been very quiet .
Now , as for tomorrow , hell , who knows ?
