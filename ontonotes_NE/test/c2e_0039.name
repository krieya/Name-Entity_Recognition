Topic : I thank my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> friends and wish everyone a Happy <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">New Year</ENAMEX> .
Posting station : BBS Unnamed space station -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Mon Jan 1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">12:05:53</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2007</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A month ago</ENAMEX> , I was really desperate , I lost my current job , which I was completely unprepared for , and had to find a job within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</ENAMEX> to keep myself going .
Now in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Christmas</ENAMEX> holiday there 's really only <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</ENAMEX> of actual work time , and I do n't think any companies are going to be hiring people during this period .
Despair , that sinking feeling weighing on my mind , so much pressure I could n't eat , could n't sleep ; I was simply going crazy .
But I still needed to do something ; getting crazy - hysteric makes no sense .
Then I started connecting with my friends in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> ; I went to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maimaiti</ENAMEX> to ask for help , consulted about my status , and looked for a way to solve the problem .
Even my relatives ' friends in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and my parents ' friends all got involved .
Friends , it 's always friends who help me at key moments .
Many friends got people they knew to recommend me , help me send out resumes , or call and commiserate with me .
There was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> friend who had just got an offer , but he did n't want to go , so he recommended me to go for him , but it was way off in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LA</ENAMEX> , plus the salary was n't ideal , but at least it could help me keep the legal status , so I thought I would take it .
After the telephone interview , I flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LA</ENAMEX> , landing at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">12:00 noon</ENAMEX> , and at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">4:00 p.m.</ENAMEX> .
I had the interview .
By then <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">17 - 18 hours</ENAMEX> had passed since I 'd gotten up at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">4:00 a.m.</ENAMEX>
Although I was too tired to walk , I still had to pump up my spirits so I 'd be in peak form for the interview .
The interview did n't last long , just <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</ENAMEX> and it was over .
I felt the interview went well , and started to feel confident .
But on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> senior level person was n't there , so <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</ENAMEX> early I had to go back to talk to him .
So the next day I got up at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">7:00</ENAMEX> and ran over to chat for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</ENAMEX> ; that guy was nice , did n't embarrass me , so after <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</ENAMEX> it ended happily .
After that the boss took me to the home office , and on the way he gave me an oral offer , and he said it would not be easy for me to come right away , that I should do the physical exam immediately and do all the paperwork , wait until after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">New Year 's</ENAMEX> , and the HR director would return and turn in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL" S_OFF="1">H1</ENAMEX> .
Then I went straight for the physical , and I filled out the application form , reference list , etc.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">3:00 p.m.</ENAMEX> , the dust finally settled .
Finally before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Christmas</ENAMEX> I received a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Christmas</ENAMEX> present .
Although I still have n't made the final decision to go , at least I have a guaranteed - minimum choice .
So I am thanking everyone for helping me .
I hope that all my friends who are still looking for work will be able to find their ideal job in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the New Year</ENAMEX> .
