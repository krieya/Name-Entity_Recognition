<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ENAMEX> said it formed a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and , eventually , to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> theaters , too .
The operator of cable - television networks said the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Turner Pictures</ENAMEX> unit will produce movies that will premiere on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Turner Broadcasting 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Turner Network Television</ENAMEX> channel , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TNT</ENAMEX> , and then will be released internationally in movie theaters .
The unit 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> offerings are slated to be `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Secret Life of Ian Fleming</ENAMEX> , '' a dramatization about the former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> spy who wrote the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bond</ENAMEX> novels , and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Treasure Island</ENAMEX> , '' produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlton Heston</ENAMEX> , who also stars in the movie .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Turner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Turner Broadcasting 's</ENAMEX> chairman , was named chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Turner Pictures</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerry Hogan</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Turner Entertainment Networks</ENAMEX> , was named president of the unit .
In an interview , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hogan</ENAMEX> said the subsidiary 's primary mission will be to make movies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TNT</ENAMEX> and to distribute them internationally .
But he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Turner Broadcasting</ENAMEX> already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
`` When that occurs , and when the time is right , we 'll release the films in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , '' he said , adding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Turner Pictures</ENAMEX> may develop such movies <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> for domestic release in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Turner</ENAMEX> has made several movies , docudramas and documentaries for its networks in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , but the company has never acted as a full - fledged movie studio and released its own pictures to theaters .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hogan</ENAMEX> said `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Secret Life of Ian Fleming</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Treasure Island</ENAMEX> '' cost <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 6 million</ENAMEX> each to make , which is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about one - third</ENAMEX> the cost of most movies made for theatrical release .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Turner</ENAMEX> move is in line with a cable - TV trend toward more original programming -- and toward finding more ways to amortize the high cost of producing films .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Viacom Inc.</ENAMEX> formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Viacom Pictures</ENAMEX> to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> low - budget movies a year that will premiere on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Showtime</ENAMEX> network and be distributed later in various markets , including foreign theaters .
