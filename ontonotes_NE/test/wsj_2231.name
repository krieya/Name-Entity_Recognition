<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright</ENAMEX> is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side , everything loose would end up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> .
We 've always thought that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> underestimated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's vitality , but maybe the state 's la - la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place .
What else is one to make of the whacky save - the - earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general ?
If passed by the voters , the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides , reduce carbon dioxide emissions by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> , ban new offshore drilling , ban chemicals thought to deplete the ozone layer , and create a new state environmental officer armed with a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</ENAMEX> budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too dirty .
The initiative is based largely on the wish - lists of the green lobby : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Sierra Club</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the League of Conservation Voters</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Natural Resources Defense Council</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Toxics Campaign</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Citizens for a Better Environment</ENAMEX> .
Interestingly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Environmental Defense Fund</ENAMEX> is having nothing to do with this one .
Not only <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Californians</ENAMEX> but all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> would pay if this thing passed .
The initiative bars the sale of any crops in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> that do n't meet the initiative 's standards .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> wheat farmers and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> market .
In other words , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> is presuming to take control of the nation 's farm policy .
As usual the green lobby 's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality .
Consider the greenhouse - effect provision .
The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> .
Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem .
But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ?
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit .
The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Van de Kamp</ENAMEX> .
He 's running for governor .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Kamp</ENAMEX> is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 6 , 1990</ENAMEX> .
That 's also <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> of the gubernatorial election .
The initiative seems to have been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> weepers who donate money .
And it allows Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Kamp</ENAMEX> to get around campaign spending limits .
He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Kamp</ENAMEX> initiative -LRB- on which there are no limits -RRB- is gravy .
This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback .
-LRB- The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> candidate , Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Wilson</ENAMEX> , is playing the initiative fundraising game too , sponsoring his own crime initiative . -RRB-
While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional , it is of course conceivable that in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> it could slide through .
This is the state that recently passed the Prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative .
If this new proposal ever does become law , the green lobby will benefit directly .
The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like .
That means the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NRDC</ENAMEX> and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation ; taxpayers would bear the cost .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Kamp</ENAMEX> and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple - pie issue among certain segments of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific , anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric .
Of course the state 's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> , for example , may decide that he does n't want to be the President who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> .
And some other segments of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs .
This grandiose initiative will help <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> define itself for the future either as a state still tethered to economic and scientific reality , or as one being led to wherever its la - la activists want to take it .
