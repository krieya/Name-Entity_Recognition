<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathryn Rice</ENAMEX> could hardly believe her eyes .
While giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills</ENAMEX> to ninth graders at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Greenville High School</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last March 16</ENAMEX> , she spotted a student looking at crib sheets .
She had seen cheating before , but these notes were uncanny .
`` A stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance ... .
At the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> surrendered before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> ... .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> - House conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> in different forms . ''
Virtually word for word , the notes matched questions and answers on the social - studies section of the test the student was taking .
In fact , the student had the answers to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost all of the 40</ENAMEX> questions in that section .
The student surrendered the notes , but not without a protest .
`` My teacher said it was OK for me to use the notes on the test , '' he said .
The teacher in question was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Yeargin</ENAMEX> -- considered by many students and parents to be <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the best at the school .
Confronted , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> admitted she had given the questions and answers <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</ENAMEX> before the examination to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> low - ability geography classes .
She had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> was fired and prosecuted under an unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> law that makes it a crime to breach test security .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , she pleaded guilty and paid a $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">500</ENAMEX> fine .
Her alternative was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</ENAMEX> in jail .
Her story is partly one of personal downfall .
She was an unstinting teacher who won laurels and inspired students , but she will probably never teach again .
In her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer ; of colleagues who say she brought them shame ; of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated harshly ; and of school - district officials stunned that despite the bald - faced nature of her actions , she became something of a local martyr .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> 's case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform , where pressures on teachers are growing and where high - stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> statute Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> violated was designed to enforce provisions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina 's</ENAMEX> school - improvement laws .
Prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students ' scores to win a bonus under the state 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Education Improvement Act</ENAMEX> .
The bonus depended on her ability to produce higher student - test scores .
`` There is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walt Haney</ENAMEX> , an education professor and testing specialist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boston College</ENAMEX> .
`` So efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise . ''
And most disturbing , it is educators , not students , who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> - state study released in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Friends for Education</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albuquerque</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.M.</ENAMEX> , school - research group , concluded that `` outright cheating by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> educators '' is `` common . ''
The group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often `` teach the test '' as Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> did , although most are never caught .
Evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last year or so</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</ENAMEX> schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test .
After numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> is revising its security practices .
And sales of test - coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming .
These materials , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Macmillan / McGraw - Hill School Publishing Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Scoring High</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Learning Materials</ENAMEX> -- are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets , according to some recent academic research .
By using them , teachers -- with administrative blessing -- telegraph to students beforehand the precise areas on which a test will concentrate , and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers .
Use of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Scoring High</ENAMEX> is widespread in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> and common in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenville County</ENAMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> 's school district .
Experts say there is n't another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> .
Under the state 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Education Improvement Act</ENAMEX> , low test scores can block students ' promotions or force entire districts into wrenching , state - supervised `` interventions '' that can mean firings .
High test scores , on the other hand , bring recognition and extra money -- a new computer lab for a school , grants for special projects , a bonus for the superintendent .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> says it is getting results .
Since the reforms went in place , for example , no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the Scholastic Aptitude Test</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> , although the state still posts the lowest average score of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 21</ENAMEX> states who use the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> as the primary college entrance examination .
Critics say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Friends of Education</ENAMEX> rates <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> one of the worst <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> states in its study on academic cheating .
Says the organization 's founder , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cannell</ENAMEX> , prosecuting Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> is `` a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously , when in fact they do n't take it seriously at all . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Sandifer</ENAMEX> , director of testing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> department of education , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cannell</ENAMEX> 's allegations of cheating `` are purely without foundation , '' and based on unfair inferences .
Partly because of worries about potential abuse , however , he says the state will begin keeping closer track of achievement - test preparation booklets <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next spring</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina 's</ENAMEX> reforms were designed for schools like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Greenville High School</ENAMEX> .
Standing on a shaded hill in a run - down area of this old textile city , the school has educated many of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina 's</ENAMEX> best and brightest , including the state 's last <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> governors , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize</ENAMEX> winning physicist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Townes</ENAMEX> and actress <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joanne Woodward</ENAMEX> .
But by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</ENAMEX> , its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad facade .
`` It was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Ward</ENAMEX> , the school 's principal .
`` Crime was awful , test scores were low , and there was no enrollment in honors programs . ''
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> took over in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> , becoming the school 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</ENAMEX> principal in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</ENAMEX> .
Her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown .
Prior to his term , a teacher bled to death in the halls , stabbed by a student .
Academically , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> says , the school was having trouble serving in harmony its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> disparate , and evenly split , student groups : a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks , many of them poor , from run - down , inner city neighborhoods .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> resolved to clean out `` deadwood '' in the school 's faculty and restore safety , and she also had some new factors working in her behalf .
One was statewide school reform , which raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment .
Another was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Yeargin</ENAMEX> , who came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenville</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> , full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward .
`` Being a teacher just became my life , '' says the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">37 - year - old</ENAMEX> Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> , a teacher for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">12 years</ENAMEX> before her dismissal . ``
I loved the school , its history .
I even dreamt about school and new things to do with my students . ''
While Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve curriculum , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> worked <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">14 - hour</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">days</ENAMEX> and fast became a student favorite .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986 - 87</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987 - 88</ENAMEX> , she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law .
Encouraged by Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> taught honor students in the state `` teacher cadet '' program , a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career .
She won grant money for the school , advised cheerleaders , ran the pep club , proposed and taught a new `` Cultural Literacy '' class in Western Civilization and was chosen by the school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PTA</ENAMEX> as `` Teacher of the Year . ''
`` She was an inspirational lady ; she had it all together , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Dobson</ENAMEX> , a freshman at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of South Carolina</ENAMEX> who had Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> in the teacher - cadet class <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
She says that because of Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Beth Marchand</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenville</ENAMEX> 11th grader , also says Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> inspired her to go into education .
`` She taught us more in Western Civilization than I 've ever learned in other classes , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelli Green</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenville</ENAMEX> senior .
In the classroom , students say , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> distinguished herself by varying teaching approaches -- forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using college - bowl type competitions .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</ENAMEX> , she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes , even to polish the furniture in her classroom .
`` She just never gave it up , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Marchand</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Beth 's</ENAMEX> mother .
`` You 'd see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game . ''
Some fellow teachers , however , viewed Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> as cocky and too yielding to students .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> says she often defended her to colleagues who called her a grandstander .
Pressures began to build .
Friends told her she was pushing too hard .
Because of deteriorating hearing , she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> 's extra work was also helping her earn points in the state 's incentive - bonus program .
But the most important source of points was student improvement on tests .
Huge gains by her students in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> meant a total of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5,000</ENAMEX> in bonuses over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> -- a meaningful addition to her <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> salary of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">23,000</ENAMEX> .
Winning a bonus for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a third year</ENAMEX> was n't that important to her , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> insists .
But others at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Greenville High</ENAMEX> say she was eager to win -- if not for money , then for pride and recognition .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Elizabeth Ariail</ENAMEX> , another social - studies teacher , says she believed Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that would n't demand good hearing .
Indeed , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last March</ENAMEX> , after attending a teaching seminar in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> says she returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenville</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> testing feeling that she had n't prepared her low - ability geography students adequately .
When test booklets were passed out <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</ENAMEX> ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">time</ENAMEX> , she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> admits she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct .
`` I was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation , '' she says .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only five</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</ENAMEX> questions were geography questions .
The rest were history , sociology , finance -- subjects they never had . ''
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> says that she also wanted to help lift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Greenville High School 's</ENAMEX> overall test scores , usually near the bottom of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</ENAMEX> district high schools in rankings carried <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</ENAMEX> by local newspapers .
Mostly , she says , she wanted to prevent the damage to self - esteem that her low - ability students would suffer from doing badly on the test .
`` These kids broke my heart , '' she says .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A whole day</ENAMEX> goes by and no one even knows they 're alive .
They desperately needed somebody who showed they cared for them , who loved them .
The last thing they needed was another drag - down blow . ''
School officials and prosecutors say Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> is lying .
They found students in an advanced class <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> who said she gave them similar help , although because the case was n't tried in court , this evidence was never presented publicly .
`` That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Watson</ENAMEX> , the prosecutor in the case , who is also president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Greenville High School 's</ENAMEX> alumni association .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class , adding : `` I wanted to help all '' students .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson</ENAMEX> says Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair .
`` Do I have much sympathy for her ? '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson</ENAMEX> asks .
`` Not really .
I believe in the system .
I believe you have to use the system to change it .
What she did was like taking the law into your own hands . ''
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> says that when the cheating was discovered , she wanted to avoid the morale - damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring .
She says she offered Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> declined .
`` She said something like ` You just want to make it easy for the school . '
I was dumbfounded , '' Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> recalls .
`` It was like someone had turned a knife in me . ''
To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities -- and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests -- Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> won widespread local support .
The school - board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students , teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf .
Supportive callers decried unfair testing , not Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> , on a local radio talk show on which she appeared .
The show did n't give the particulars of Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> 's offense , saying only that she helped students do better on the test .
`` The message to the board of education out of all this is we 've got to take a serious look at how we 're doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state , '' said the talk - show host .
Editorials in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenville</ENAMEX> newspaper allowed that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> was wrong , but also said the case showed how testing was being overused .
The radio show `` enraged us , '' says Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> .
Partly because of the show , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson</ENAMEX> says , the district decided not to recommend Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> - time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record .
And legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over 50</ENAMEX> witnesses , mostly students , were interviewed .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Greenville High School</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , some students -- especially on the cheerleading squad -- were crushed .
`` It 's hard to explain to a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">17 - year - old</ENAMEX> why someone they like had to go , '' says Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> .
Soon , T - shirts appeared in the corridors that carried the school 's familiar red - and - white <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GHS</ENAMEX> logo on the front .
On the back , the shirts read , `` We have all the answers . ''
Many colleagues are angry at Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> .
`` She did a lot of harm , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathryn Rice</ENAMEX> , who had discovered the crib notes .
`` We work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay , and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us . ''
But several teachers also say the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores .
Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gayle Key</ENAMEX> , a mathematics teacher , `` The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms .
There may be others doing what she did . ''
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win reinstatement , and because she was afraid of further charges .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> , for one , was relieved .
Despite the strong evidence against Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> , popular sentiment was so strong in her favor , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> says , that `` I 'm afraid a jury would n't have convicted her .
