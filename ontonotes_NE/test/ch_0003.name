Not not really very far
and it 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">it 's a you</ENAMEX> know it 's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">question</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">having</ENAMEX> a few solid days to work on it you know which I just have n't had
I mean
Well I mean is it too much to ask you to just take just come up to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Windsor</ENAMEX> and finish it after you get back .
Well we 've got to l- we 've got to move
and we 've got to and I 've got to do my classes
but so probably you know but you know I 'm not te- I 'm only teaching I think one class
so I 'll have
I just would feel better if you had it done before you turned up at the department .
I mean you 're coming back the thirty - first
you do n't start teaching until when ?
Like the fifth or sixth
I mean
%ach .
yeah .
Lord .
yeah
no
it 's it 's n-
yeah
I th- I do n't I do n't you know I I do n't think it 's going to be a big deal
%uh I really kind of st- doubt that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle</ENAMEX> will -- -- will be ready to go
%um you know she was already talking about sort of middle of September %um in the beginning of the spring .
oh god .
yeah
but she 's c- she could n't she 's got more leeway than you I think .
yeah
but I 've got so much more going for me than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">she does</ENAMEX> . I know . You know in the in the larger scheme .
If they do n't tenure you we 'll sue <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">them</ENAMEX> .
We wo n't sue them
but no
anyway so It 'll work out
but anyway I 'm I 'm so I 'm
I I mean I caught myself today just getting a little sort of
Edgy .
yeah .
Well look %um
But but
If you change your mind and you want to just come right up to Windsor and %um finesse the move we can do that .
No .
No
I do n't want to do that .
I do n't want to do that . It 'll because I it 'll be better to do the move right away anyway because I 'm I you know I ca n't come home and go right to work
I just ca n't do that .
You 'll be exhausted
yeah .
yeah
and I wo n't want to do it .
I wo n't be able to concentrate .
Right
whereas we can do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">things</ENAMEX>
Whereas spending together time together and moving and settling in while moving is is fine
yeah .
yeah .
All right
well %um I g- I guess we 'll have to figure out our respective movements <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">when</ENAMEX> when it gets closer
but I 'm going to %um Ashfield with Greg uh-huh . tomorrow
uh-huh .
And %um
Stay up there ?
Well Greg and Jim %uh Jimco <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">and the kids</ENAMEX> are leaving for Japan <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX>
uh-huh .
and %um %uh Greg 's going to go up on a hiking trip with a friend
uh-huh
but he 's going to %um stop by Ashfield to drop off the dogs .
uh-huh .
So he can <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">take</ENAMEX> me and the baby up
uh-huh .
and then I 'll maybe come back down with him
he 's coming back down I guess ten days later .
uh-huh .
I mean he 's not staying the whole time
but he 'll come back the last weekend of the month I think they said uh-huh . and then go back down to New York
and he can probably take us then because it 's gotten to be I just moving on my own is just very very difficult .
No
stay up there .
%um well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">and</ENAMEX> I 'm going to try and get back to work on my paper which is just ridiculous
but <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yeah</ENAMEX> . uh-huh . I 'm going to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">an</ENAMEX> effort .
Well we <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">can</ENAMEX> both make an effort you know
you can I 'll finish my book
you finish your <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paper</ENAMEX> you know . yeah . if you if you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">n't</ENAMEX> already
Although you know CUNY <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classes</ENAMEX> start really early .
uh-huh
yeah
but then do n't you have all those holidays right at the beginning ?
That 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">true</ENAMEX> .
That 's a good point .
I should really use those should n't I ?
yeah .
I have n't lone lined up any childcare yet
I 'm being really flaky about it
and I know I 'm going to hate myself later .
You know I really ought to take the semester off
but did I tell you this <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">is</ENAMEX> the last year of the
i- is that for sure ?
It 's not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">for</ENAMEX> sure yet
but uh-huh . %um but they 've sent CUNY a letter uh-huh . saying that the President did not ask for funding for it in his budget uh-huh . and it looks quite doubtful that the Senate is going to want to put it back in . uh-huh %um so that CUNY thinks that this is the last year of it
so I 'm reluctant to take a semester off uh-huh . considering that it that I would only then have one semester left .
Well <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">anyway</ENAMEX> t- you know this is not going I mean apart from the tenure and the book you know this is not going to be a killing term for me .
I 'm only teaching one class
and I 've taught it before
uh-huh .
so you know
and and I and I
Well once your tenure file goes in I 'll be ready to believe that
but until you get it in I I do n't think you should have I think you should have you know you should not be cutting corners on putting that file together .
Obvious .
That 's like critical for us .
yeah
yeah .
So I do n't want you to fee- I do n't want you to take on a a lot of extra stuff at the beginning because well I it does n't make sense .
yeah .
w- believe me dear
once you have tenure I will have no mercy .
Good good .
Especially because you 're going to be away every summer you 're really going to have to do a lot of yeah . you 're going to have to take a lot of responsibility during the year to make me feel like things are <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at all</ENAMEX> equal .
Right .
But not this not immediately this semester just because okay . you that you know you 've you 've got a child now .
That 's right .
You 've got <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">to</ENAMEX> get tenure .
That 's right .
So what was it what was your trip in what was the time in New Mexico like ?
So
oh <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">god</ENAMEX> it was horrible .
Really ?
It was horrible .
Why ?
I ca n't i- I was so tense
and the baby was so unhappy
because because you were tense
and I think she just I think that 's what it is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yeah</ENAMEX> sure . because the minute I got here I <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">relaxed</ENAMEX> completely
and she 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">been</ENAMEX> just an angel .
yeah
but I mean that that makes perfect sense .
yeah
I know it does .
Like dogs .
yeah .
yeah .
It was awful
th- w- you know we may get cut off at some moment
so uh-huh . if we do you know I 'll I 'll call you when I get to Ashfield .
okay .
%um it was just awful
they I was stuck up on that hill
%uh they only had the Legend
uh-huh .
and I had I they kept telling me I did n't need to rent a car which <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">I absolutely did</ENAMEX> .
uh-huh .
%um so anyway I did n't have my own transportation .
uh-huh .
They were buying a house .
They have now bought a house .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">So they were</ENAMEX> just out driving around all day .
They were completely stressed out .
They had finished looking by the time I had got there
but they were debating they <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">were making a-</ENAMEX> trying to make an offer
uh-huh .
and Alexis you know has no confidence about this
uh-huh .
and he had the most ridiculous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">realtor</ENAMEX> you 've ever seen .
uh-huh .
%um and %uh he hates owning property
and he and he could only buy a house for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">three hundred</ENAMEX> and thirty thousand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dollars</ENAMEX> which was -- -- about half of what he wanted to spend
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">and</ENAMEX> %um he was a wreck
uh-huh .
and then Joel showed up
uh-huh .
Jemma was there
and mom was picking on Jemma like she always does even though Jemma 's a doll .
uh-huh .
Joel then turned up the day after I <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">arrived and</ENAMEX> drove us mad .
Drove us crazy .
He was more obnoxious than he 's ever been .
uh-huh
how do you know ?
You have n't seen him in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ages</ENAMEX> .
Well Jemma said so .
I think I have greater tolerance for Joel than anyone in your family does .
I think you do .
I think you do
but he really was he really was a pain in the neck
and Jemma <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">said</ENAMEX> it 's because his girlfriend <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">just</ENAMEX> dumped him .
uh-huh uh-huh .
%um but anyway
so mom and Alexis were freaking out because of that
but they have no ability to set any limits you know .
So like they ca n't say to Joel look you know go away for a while
or I mean she could n't say to Judith no they ca n't come that week .
uh-huh .
you know
and th- and we were supposed to go out <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">to</ENAMEX> dinner one night
and they showed up unexpectedly .
They were supposed to be out .
They had gone to the Grand Canyon , and did n't expect them back .
uh-huh .
And they showed up unexpectedly
and you know they mom and Alexis could n't could not bring themselves to say we 're taking Claire out to a nice dinner
uh-huh .
see you later
this is our only evening with her yeah . you know
we want to have some time with her .
They could n't bring themselves to say that
but they were so upset that he 'd come back that they that the evening was just like a complete
it was painful .
Good .
And we went to a different restaurant a cheap restaurant
I mean it was it was just painful
and I j- I felt so pissed off because you know there I was expecting a family vacation
I mean it 's not so much Joel
I mean oh well anyway yeah
I mean it was supposed to be a family <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">vacation</ENAMEX>
yeah .
and it was like it was like so stressful
I mean I do n't know why I did n't know why I had bothered to go .
yeah .
And then you know Eve Eve and Seth were down in their house
and mom 's all of her energies seemed to be going towards protecting Eve from too <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">many</ENAMEX> distractions uh-huh because Eve had to work .
yeah .
So you know there was you could n't go to Eve 's house
or you could n't you could n't ask Eve to have Joel and Jemma for a night uh-huh . although she was perfectly capable of having Guy and Jenny for a night .
uh-huh .
I was furious .
And then Guy came
and he was kind of a jerk you know .
He was kind of harsh with me and %um you know just sort of not very sensitive and did n't want to help with Joel and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jemma</ENAMEX> at all .
We finally made him take them out for an afternoon .
I mean it was all just in you know just ridiculous .
And it and it was n't so great with Eve either .
She she said she wanted to spend a day with me .
uh-huh
so I set aside this so I w- you know I set aside the day she told me
uh-huh
and it what it came down to was my going to her hairdresser with her uh-huh and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sitting</ENAMEX> there while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">she</ENAMEX> talked to her hairdresser for an hour and a half . and then going out to lunch with her and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">babysitter</ENAMEX> uh-huh Who brought <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the baby</ENAMEX> to meet us
and I thought that the reason the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">babysitter</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">staying</ENAMEX> for lunch was because she would then take the baby away again
Right
But at the end of lunch , Eve just told her to go home .
uh-huh
So we 'd have this we 'd have this two hour lunch with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">babysitter</ENAMEX> .
uh-huh
and then we had like half an hour to go into some shops
and that was the end of the day
And it was like I mean %uh it was almost if she was protecting herself from spending time with me .
yeah
It was really weird .
%um and then <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">they wanted</ENAMEX> to borrow the Baby Bjorn for their ha-
they 're taking Emma on a they 're on a camping trip right now with the baby .
uh-huh
and I got kind of peeved
and I decided I was n't going to lend it to them
Well y-
I mean
I just did n't want to ,
Well anyway you use it , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">right</ENAMEX> ?
Well I I I have n't used it on Long Island although I did think I was going to .
Well but I mean what they were going to take it and then mail it back to you
or
yeah
yeah
but I was like forget it
I 'm going to lend this thing to
No
that 's insane .
No
they they <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">they</ENAMEX> can go fucking spend some of their own money for a change
