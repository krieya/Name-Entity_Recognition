Consumers may want to move their telephones a little closer to the TV set .
Couch - potato jocks watching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Monday Night Football</ENAMEX> '' can now vote during halftime for the greatest play in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</ENAMEX> from among <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> filmed replays .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two weeks ago</ENAMEX> , viewers of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</ENAMEX> consumer segments started calling a 900 number for advice on various life - style issues .
And the new syndicated `` reality '' show `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hard Copy</ENAMEX> '' records viewers ' opinions for possible airing on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day 's</ENAMEX> show .
Interactive telephone technology has taken a new leap in sophistication , and television programmers are racing to exploit the possibilities .
Eventually viewers may grow bored with the technology and resent the cost .
But right now programmers are figuring that viewers who are busy dialing up a range of services may put down their remote control zappers and stay tuned .
`` We 've been spending a lot of time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> talking to TV production people , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Parks</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Call Interactive</ENAMEX> , which supplied technology for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC Sports</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">consumer minutes</ENAMEX> .
`` With the competitiveness of the television market <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> , everyone is looking for a way to get viewers more excited . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of the leaders behind the expanded use of 900 numbers is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Call Interactive</ENAMEX> , a joint venture of giants <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Telephone -AMP- Telegraph Co</ENAMEX> .
Formed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , the venture weds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> 's newly expanded 900 service with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</ENAMEX> voice - activated computers in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omaha</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neb.</ENAMEX> , service center .
Other long - distance carriers have also begun marketing enhanced 900 service , and special consultants are springing up to exploit the new tool .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blair Entertainment</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> firm that advises TV stations and sells ads for them , has just formed a subsidiary -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">900 Blair</ENAMEX> -- to apply the technology to television .
The use of 900 toll numbers has been expanding rapidly in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
For a while , high - cost pornography lines and services that tempt children to dial -LRB- and redial -RRB- movie or music information earned the service a somewhat sleazy image , but new legal restrictions are aimed at trimming excesses .
The cost of a 900 call is set by the originator -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC Sports</ENAMEX> , for example -- with the cheapest starting at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents</ENAMEX> .
Billing is included in a caller 's regular phone bill .
From the fee , the local phone company and the long - distance carrier extract their costs to carry the call , passing the rest of the money to the originator , which must cover advertising and other costs .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</ENAMEX> , the technology has become more flexible and able to handle much more volume .
Before , callers of 900 numbers would just listen and not talk , or they 'd vote `` yes '' or `` no '' by calling <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> numbers .
-LRB- People in the phone business call this technology `` 900 click . '' -RRB-
Now , callers are led through complex menus of choices to retrieve information they want , and the hardware can process <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</ENAMEX> calls in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">90 seconds</ENAMEX> .
Up to now , 900 numbers have mainly been used on local TV stations and cable channels .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MTV</ENAMEX> used one to give away the house that rock star <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Bon Jovi</ENAMEX> grew up in .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Turner Broadcasting System 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cable News Network</ENAMEX> has invited viewers to respond nightly to topical issues -LRB- `` Should the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military intervene in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> ? '' -RRB- , but even the hottest controversies on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> log <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 10,000</ENAMEX> calls .
The newest uses of the 900 - interactive technology demonstrate the growing variety of applications .
Capital Cities / <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> Inc. , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Electric Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> unit are expected to announce soon a joint campaign to raise awareness about hunger .
The subject will be written into the plots of prime - time shows , and viewers will be given a 900 number to call .
Callers will be sent educational booklets , and the call 's modest cost will be an immediate method of raising money .
Other network applications have very different goals .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC Sports</ENAMEX> was looking for ways to lift deflated halftime ratings for `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Monday Night Football</ENAMEX> . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Sanger</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC Sports 's</ENAMEX> marketing director , says that now <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">`` tens of thousands ''</ENAMEX> of fans call its 900 number <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each week</ENAMEX> to vote for the best punt return , quarterback sack , etc .
Profit from the calls goes to charity , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC Sports</ENAMEX> also uses the calls as a sales tool : After thanking callers for voting , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Gifford</ENAMEX> offers a football videotape for $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">19.95</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> of callers stay on the line to order it .
Jackets may be sold next .
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC Sports</ENAMEX> recently began <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">`` Scores Plus</ENAMEX> , '' a year - round , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">24 - hour</ENAMEX> 900 line providing a complex array of scores , analysis and fan news .
A spokesman said its purpose is `` to bolster the impression that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC Sports</ENAMEX> is always there for people . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's `` On - Line '' <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">consumer minutes</ENAMEX> have increased advertiser spending during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> , the network 's weakest period .
Each <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekday</ENAMEX> matches a sponsor and a topic : On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Mondays</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Unilever N.V. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lever Bros.</ENAMEX> sponsors tips on diet and exercise , followed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">30 - second</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lever Bros.</ENAMEX> commercial .
Viewers can call a 900 number for additional advice , which will be tailored to their needs based on the numbers they punch -LRB- `` Press <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> if you 're pregnant , '' etc . -RRB- .
If the caller stays on the line and leaves a name and address for the sponsor , coupons and a newsletter will be mailed , and the sponsor will be able to gather a list of desirable potential customers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diane Seaman</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC - TV</ENAMEX> vice president , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> has been able to charge premium rates for this ad time .
She would n't say what the premium is , but it 's believed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40 %</ENAMEX> above regular <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daytime</ENAMEX> rates .
`` We were able to get advertisers to use their promotion budget for this , because they get a chance to do couponing , '' says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seaman</ENAMEX> .
`` And we were able to attract some new advertisers because this is something new . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parks</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Call Interactive</ENAMEX> says TV executives are considering the use of 900 numbers for `` talk shows , game shows , news and opinion surveys . ''
Experts are predicting a big influx of new shows in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> , when a service called `` automatic number information '' will become widely available .
This service identifies each caller 's phone number , and it can be used to generate instant mailing lists .
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">`` Hard Copy</ENAMEX> , '' the new syndicated tabloid show from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paramount Pictures</ENAMEX> , will use its 900 number for additional purposes that include research , says executive producer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark B. von S. Monsky</ENAMEX> .
`` For a piece on local heroes of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> , we can ask people to leave the name and number of anyone they know who won a medal , '' he says .
`` That 'll save us time and get people involved . ''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monsky</ENAMEX> sees much bigger changes ahead .
`` These are just baby steps toward real interactive video , which I believe will be the biggest thing yet to affect television , '' he says .
Although it would be costly to shoot multiple versions , TV programmers could let audiences vote on different endings for a movie .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox Broadcasting</ENAMEX> experimented with this concept <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> when viewers of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">`` Married ... With Children ''</ENAMEX> voted on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al</ENAMEX> should say `` I love you '' to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peg</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Valentine 's Day</ENAMEX> .
Someday , viewers may also choose different depths of news coverage .
`` A menu by phone could let you decide , ` I 'm interested in just the beginning of story No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> , and I want story No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> in depth , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monsky</ENAMEX> says .
`` You 'll start to see shows where viewers program the program .
