Savings and loans reject blacks for mortgage loans twice as often as they reject whites , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Office of Thrift Supervision</ENAMEX> said .
But that does n't necessarily mean thrifts are discriminating against blacks , the agency said .
The office , an arm of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> , said it does n't have data on the financial position of applicants and thus ca n't determine why blacks are rejected more often .
Nevertheless , on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> , where the information was released <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> banking subcommittee hearing , lawmakers said they are worried that financial institutions are routinely discriminating against minorities .
They asked regulators to suggest new ways to force banks and thrifts to comply with anti-discrimination laws .
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Dixon</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ill.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs , said , `` I 'm not a statistician .
But when blacks are getting their loan applications rejected twice as often as whites -- and in some cities , it is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> times as often -- I conclude that discrimination is part of the problem . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Grohl</ENAMEX> , a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. League of Savings Institutions</ENAMEX> , said , `` The data is a red flag , but lacking the financial data you ca n't make a case that discrimination is widespread . ''
The trade group official added : `` Certainly the federal government should take a hard look at it . ''
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dixon</ENAMEX> held the hearing to follow up on a provision in the savings and loan bailout bill that required regulators to report on evidence of discimination in mortgage lending .
The legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race , sex and income level of borrowers , but that information wo n't be gathered in new studies for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</ENAMEX> at least .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> said its studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , which adjust for income differences and other variables , showed that blacks received fewer home mortgages from banks and thrifts than whites .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John LaWare</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> governor , told the subcommittee the evidence is mixed and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> 's believes the vast majority of banks are n't discriminating .
For instance , he noted , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> studies have shown that blacks receive more home improvement loans than whites .
Several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift regulators generally said they have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</ENAMEX> to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination .
`` We would be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> to admit that we have not devoted the necessary amount of emphasis over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several years</ENAMEX> '' to developing examinations for discrimination , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Fiechter</ENAMEX> , a top official of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Office of Thrift Supervision</ENAMEX> .
`` If we 've got folks out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly , '' said Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Riegle</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mich.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , chairman of the banking committee , `` then that is a matter that needs remedy <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">now</ENAMEX> , not <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six months from now</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six years from now</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">26 years from now</ENAMEX> . ''
Officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</ENAMEX> said they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FDIC</ENAMEX> said it has issued <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> citations to banks over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</ENAMEX> for discriminatory practices .
The comptroller 's office said it found no indications of illegal discrimination in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,437</ENAMEX> examinations of banks since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1987</ENAMEX> .
The comptroller 's office also said that of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37,000</ENAMEX> complaints it received since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1987</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 16</ENAMEX> alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending .
The agency investigated the complaints but no violations were cited .
Thrift regulators did n't give any figures on their enforcement actions .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiechter</ENAMEX> said that among the possibilities being considered by regulators to fight discrimination is the use of `` testers '' -- government investigators who would pose as home buyers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> has used testers to investigate discrimination in rental housing .
Using testers could be controversial with financial institutions , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grohl</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. League of Savings Institutions</ENAMEX> had n't yet taken any position on the matter .
