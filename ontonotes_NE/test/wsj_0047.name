<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Department of Health and Human Services</ENAMEX> plans to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal - tissue transplants .
Medical researchers believe the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and Huntington 's .
But anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal - tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Mason</ENAMEX> , assistant secretary for health , said the ban on federal funding of fetal - tissue transplant research `` should be continued indefinitely . ''
He said the ban wo n't stop privately funded tissue - transplant research or federally funded fetal - tissue research that does n't involve transplants .
Department officials say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">HHS</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Sullivan</ENAMEX> will support Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> 's ruling , which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> .
Both Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> and Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> oppose federal funding for abortion , as does President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , except in cases where a woman 's life is threatened .
The controversy began in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> , aware of the policy implications of its research , asked for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">HHS</ENAMEX> review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson 's disease .
The department placed a moratorium on the research , pending a review of scientific , legal and ethical issues .
A majority of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NIH</ENAMEX> - appointed panel recommended <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late last year</ENAMEX> that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions , but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding .
The dispute has hampered the administration 's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NIH</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Centers for Disease Control</ENAMEX> .
Several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal - tissue transplants .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio Novello</ENAMEX> , whom Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> nominated to serve as surgeon general , reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Novello</ENAMEX> is deputy director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</ENAMEX> .
Some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this week</ENAMEX> , Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> tried to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates to head the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NIH</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CDC</ENAMEX> will be judged by `` standards of scientific and administrative excellence , '' not politics .
But the administration 's handling of the fetal - tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists .
`` When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground , there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myron Genel</ENAMEX> , associate dean of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Yale Medical School</ENAMEX> .
`` The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized , so that no mechanism exists '' for finding a middle ground .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yale</ENAMEX> is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal - tissue transplants .
But Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genel</ENAMEX> warns that Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> 's ruling may discourage private funding .
`` The unavailability of federal funds , and the climate in which the decision was made , certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support , '' he said .
Despite the flap over transplants , federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts .
`` Such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer '' or to regulate genes that cause Down 's syndrome , the leading cause of mental retardation , according to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NIH</ENAMEX> summary .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NIH</ENAMEX> currently spends <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 8 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</ENAMEX> on fetal - tissue research out of a total research budget of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 billion</ENAMEX> .
