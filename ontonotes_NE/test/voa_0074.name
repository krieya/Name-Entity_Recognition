The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> denies <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> warships are steering clear of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Suez Canal</ENAMEX> in the wake of the apparent terrorist bombing of the destroyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> although none has used the canal , since the attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this month</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VOA</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Belida</ENAMEX> reports security along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Suez</ENAMEX> is being re-evaluated .
At the same time , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> forces in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> gulf countries have been put on alert against possible terrorist action .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Baken</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> forces in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> have now been placed on threat condition delta , the highest state of alert .
The move ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> , follows the earlier decision to place <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> forces in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahrain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> on the same delta status , because of terrorist threats .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> forces in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> harbor of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> were elevated to delta immediately following the deadly <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 12th</ENAMEX> terrorist bombing of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> destroyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baken</ENAMEX> says the heightened alert in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> , affects some <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> military personnel in those <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries .
He says it was ordered because of what he termed credible threats , but he says no targets were specified .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> spokesman is meanwhile disputing news reports saying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Defense Department</ENAMEX> has decided to order <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">US Navy</ENAMEX> ships to temporarily stop using <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Suez Canal</ENAMEX> out of fear of terrorist attack .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baken</ENAMEX> says no such instructions have been given , but he acknowledges security along the canal is being constantly evaluated .
We are evaluating with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptians</ENAMEX> .
Obviously , the security situation in the canal , we do that all the time .
So , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptians</ENAMEX> we both have a very fundamental interest in keeping the canal secure .
No <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> ships have transited through the canal since before the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 12th</ENAMEX> attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> destroyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baken</ENAMEX> says no ships were scheduled to make the trip for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</ENAMEX> .
The badly damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> has been towed out of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Aden Harbor</ENAMEX> and is being loaded aboard a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Norwegian</ENAMEX> owned heavy lift ship called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the Blue Merlin</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baken</ENAMEX> , says no decision has yet been made on the route <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the Blue Merlin</ENAMEX> will take to return the destroyer to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> for repairs .
