<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> made news <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</ENAMEX> when it landed an unusual contract to manage all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastman Kodak Co. 's</ENAMEX> data - processing needs .
But the computer giant appears to have lost a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> key contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kodak</ENAMEX> to archrival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital Equipment Corp</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kodak</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> confirmed that it has entered negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maynard</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> to manage all of its voice and data communications needs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kodak</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rochester</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> also had bid for the business .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armonk</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y</ENAMEX> .
The loss is a setback to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> , which pointed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kodak</ENAMEX> contract as an example of its success in systems integration .
That 's an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide turnkey communications and computing services to major corporations .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kodak</ENAMEX> spokesman declined to disclose the potential value of the contract , which is still in negotiation .
He said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Telephone -AMP- Telegraph</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCI Communications Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rochester Telephone Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> itself would likely be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> 's subcontractors on the project .
`` When we decided to look outside the company for critical data - processing and communications services , we wanted to get the best vendor for that service , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Allen</ENAMEX> , the spokesman .
`` That 's why we went with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> for data center management ... and now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> for voice and data telecommunications .
