As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yogi Berra</ENAMEX> might say , it 's deja vu all over again .
Crouched at shortstop , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bert Campaneris</ENAMEX> , once <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Oakland</ENAMEX> 's master thief , effortlessly scoops up a groundball and flips it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> .
In the outfield , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Blair</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Orioles</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> - time <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gold Glove</ENAMEX> winner , elegantly shags a fly .
On the mound , former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Red Sox</ENAMEX> great <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Tiant</ENAMEX> , the wily master of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,001</ENAMEX> moves , throws an off - speed strike .
`` Babies , kiddies , '' growls their manager -- a fellow named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Earl Weaver</ENAMEX> , who , in a different time , handled <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Series</ENAMEX> teams and now handles <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Gold Coast Suns</ENAMEX> .
`` Old - time kiddies , '' he says .
Perhaps .
But for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few months</ENAMEX> , these boys of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">summers long past</ENAMEX> are going to be reveling in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">an Indian summer</ENAMEX> of the soul .
Now that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the baseball season</ENAMEX> is officially over , you see , it 's time for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a new season</ENAMEX> to begin .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> is the debut of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senior Professional Baseball Association</ENAMEX> , a new <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> - team pro sports circuit , modeled after the highly successful senior tennis and golf tours and complete with good salaries , a cable television contract and even expansion plans .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and ninety two</ENAMEX> former greats , near greats , hardly knowns and unknowns begin a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</ENAMEX> - game , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - month season</ENAMEX> in spring - training stadiums up and down <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> .
For everyone involved , it 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> more swig of that elixir of youth , baseball .
`` Someone always makes you quit , '' says legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">St. Louis Cardinals</ENAMEX> centerfielder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curt Flood</ENAMEX> , the league 's commissioner .
`` You feel you want <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> more -- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> more at - bat , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> more hit , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> more game . ''
Until the baby - faced heroes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> reclaim these ballparks for spring training , there is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> more .
And not just for the players .
It 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> more for the baseball - loving lawyers , accountants and real estate developers who ponied up <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 million</ENAMEX> each for the chance to be an owner , to step into the shoes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a Gene Autry</ENAMEX> or have a beer with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rollie Fingers</ENAMEX> .
`` Nothing can be better than this , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Sider</ENAMEX> , owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the West Palm Beach Tropics</ENAMEX> .
Early in the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sider</ENAMEX> , an estate lawyer , pores over last wills and testaments .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Midmorning</ENAMEX> , he dons an orange - and - blue uniform and , for fun , may field a bunt from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Kingman</ENAMEX> .
It 's one more , too , for the fans who dream of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a season that never ends</ENAMEX> .
`` I feel like a little kid , '' says a gleeful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex de Castro</ENAMEX> , a car salesman , who has stopped by a workout of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Suns</ENAMEX> to slip <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campaneris</ENAMEX> cards to the Great Man Himself to be autographed .
The league 's promoters hope retirees and tourists will join die - hard fans like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Castro</ENAMEX> and pack the stands to see the seniors .
The league is the brainchild of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> real estate developer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Morley</ENAMEX> -- once a minor - leaguer himself -- who says he had the idea <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last January</ENAMEX> while lying on a beach in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> .
When he sent letters offering <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,250</ENAMEX> retired major leaguers the chance of another <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">season</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">730</ENAMEX> responded .
Eventually , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 250</ENAMEX> made the trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> to compete for the available slots .
-LRB- Players have to be <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">35 or older</ENAMEX> , except for catchers , who are eligible at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">32</ENAMEX> because life behind the plate is so rough . -RRB-
For some players , the lure is money -- up to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">15,000</ENAMEX> a month .
Others , just released from the majors , hope the senior league will be their bridge back into the big - time .
But as they hurl fireballs that smolder rather than burn , and relive old duels in the sun , it 's clear that most are there to make their fans cheer again or recapture the camaraderie of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons past</ENAMEX> or prove to themselves and their colleagues that they still have it -- or something close to it .
`` My fastball is good .
Real good , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">39 - year - old</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Broberg</ENAMEX> , working in the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</ENAMEX> heat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tropics</ENAMEX> camp .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broberg</ENAMEX> , who started with the now - defunct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington Senators</ENAMEX> , says that when he left baseball in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</ENAMEX> , he `` never looked back . ''
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</ENAMEX> , he ignored baseball altogether , even the sports pages .
Now Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broberg</ENAMEX> , a lawyer , claims he 'd play for free .
`` You ca n't give it up that easily , '' he says .
`` I tried . ''
The nagging memory of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">one afternoon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen years ago</ENAMEX> drove <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Gideon</ENAMEX> , a lean <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">36 - year - old</ENAMEX> righthander to take a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - month</ENAMEX> leave from selling insurance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> to try out for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weaver</ENAMEX> 's team .
`` It does n't replace pitching in the majors , but it proves to me that I would have been able to play if I 'd stayed healthy , '' he says .
Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</ENAMEX> , late in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">season</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">then - 21</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gideon</ENAMEX> made his only major league appearance , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two - thirds</ENAMEX> innings for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Texas Rangers</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chicago White Sox</ENAMEX> .
He gave up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> hits , walked <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> and did n't get a decision .
Arm troubles forced him back to the minors <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next year</ENAMEX> .
`` There 's a satisfaction in going against the rules , '' offers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will McEnaney</ENAMEX> , once a stopper with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Red Machine</ENAMEX> .
He means the rule that a player ca n't cut it after a certain age .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</ENAMEX> he hustles to house - painting jobs in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chevy</ENAMEX> pickup before and after training with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tropics</ENAMEX> .
While sipping a beer after practice , he vividly recounts getting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Red Sox 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Yastrzemski</ENAMEX> to pop out to end <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the 1975 World Series</ENAMEX> , and repeating the feat against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yankees</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy White</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</ENAMEX> .
Some of the game 's reigning philosophers dislike the idea of middle - aged men attempting a young man 's sport .
`` I personally do n't enjoy seeing players who I remember vividly from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">their playing days</ENAMEX> running about and being gallant about their deficiencies , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Angell</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New Yorker</ENAMEX> magazine 's resident baseball sage .
`` I feel people should be allowed to remember players as they were . ''
Worse , says baseball author <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Ritter</ENAMEX> , `` Someone will get a heart attack and that will be the end of the whole story . ''
But the ballplayers disagree .
Most are trim .
Some have been training for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> ; others only recently left active status .
-LRB- No one has worked out the players ' average age , but most appear to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">their late 30s</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
And there 's pride .
`` I 'm not going to look stupid , '' vows former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pittsburgh Pirate</ENAMEX> second baseman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rennie Stennett</ENAMEX> , sweat dotting his brow as he prepares for some practice swings .
`` It 's going to be a tough league , '' promises the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">47 - year - old</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campaneris</ENAMEX> .
`` There will be a lot of malice . ''
Men who have played hard all their lives are n't about to change their habits , he says .
Nonetheless , one ca n't help wonder whether the game will be just a little bit slower .
At the weatherbeaten <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pompano Beach</ENAMEX> municipal stadium , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">45 - year - old</ENAMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Oriole</ENAMEX> , knows his power is n't what it used to be .
So he adjusts .
He no longer crowds the plate .
He 's not thinking about home runs anymore , just base hits .
Still , `` how sweet it is , '' he says , savoring the fat sound of the well - hit line drive that bounces off the center field wall .
And do n't expect many complete games by pitchers -- perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">288</ENAMEX> , laughs Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fingers</ENAMEX> , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Oakland</ENAMEX> reliever .
Expect `` tricky '' stuff from pitchers , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weaver</ENAMEX> , the manager .
Expect brushbacks but no beanballs , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McEnaney</ENAMEX> .
Even expect stolen bases , says the wiry and fit Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campaneris</ENAMEX> : `` If you know how to slide , it 's no problem , '' he says .
And expect slower fastballs .
`` I 'm not so young anymore , '' concedes the cigar - chomping , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">48 - year - old</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tiant</ENAMEX> .
`` I wo n't be throwing <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90 mph</ENAMEX> , but I will throw <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 - plus</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
White - haired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro Ramos</ENAMEX> , at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">54</ENAMEX> the league 's oldest player and a pitcher - coach with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Suns</ENAMEX> , has lost even more speed .
Stuffing a wad of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Red Man</ENAMEX> into his cheek , he admits the fastball he brought into the majors in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</ENAMEX> has become a slowball .
Its maximum velocity is <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">72 mph</ENAMEX> .
But he is n't worried .
He will compensate with the guile learned from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">his years</ENAMEX> in the majors .
He has good control .
He will keep the ball down , move it around .
After all , he says , `` Even to make love , you need experience .
