From the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 30 - Oct . 4</ENAMEX> issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Economist</ENAMEX> :
What defeated General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aoun</ENAMEX> was not only the weight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Syrian</ENAMEX> army .
The weight of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> 's history was also against him ; and it is a history <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> is in danger of repeating .
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> , and however unfairly , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> is regarded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> world as a colonial aberration .
Its best hope of acceptance by its neighbours lies in reaching a settlement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> .
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> is being remade by demography .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greater Israel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</ENAMEX> the children <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">under six</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> .
Within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jews</ENAMEX> will probably be the minority .
Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> will neither share power with all these <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> nor , says its present prime minister , redraw its borders closer to its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">pre-1967</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> heartland .
By not choosing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of these options , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> will condemn themselves , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Maronites</ENAMEX> did , to perpetual war with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> in their midst , and so to the internal erosion of their state .
Unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Maronites</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jews</ENAMEX> will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> will become <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belfast</ENAMEX> before it becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX> .
But that is not much of a consolation to draw from the failure of General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aoun</ENAMEX> .
