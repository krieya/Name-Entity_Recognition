Freight rates , declining for most of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</ENAMEX> because of competition spurred by deregulation , are bottoming out , turning upward and threatening to fuel inflation .
Trucking , shipping and air - freight companies have announced rate increases , scheduled for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early next year</ENAMEX> , reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport .
Major shippers say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few years</ENAMEX> .
That 's a big change from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> when freight haulage was a bright spot for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> productivity , helping to restrain inflation and make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> industry more competitive abroad .
`` Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation , and rates are starting to move up '' at a rate `` close to or slightly more than the inflation rate , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clifford Sayre</ENAMEX> , director of logistics at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Du Pont Co</ENAMEX> .
Shippers surveyed recently by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ohio State University</ENAMEX> said they expect their freight - transport , storage and distribution costs to rise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 4 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
Only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</ENAMEX> shippers polled expected their freight - transport costs to decrease , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">past years</ENAMEX> .
`` This is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</ENAMEX> since transportation deregulation in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> that we have had such a dramatic and broad - based upturn in perceived transportation rates , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard LaLonde</ENAMEX> , a transportation logistics professor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ohio State</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> .
The deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> enabled shippers to bargain for transportation .
Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently , leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill .
Shippers cut <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 35 billion</ENAMEX> from their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> , inter-city truck and rail costs , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 150 billion</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 6.4 %</ENAMEX> of gross national product , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> of GNP in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> .
But with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight - transport system , rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates .
`` Shippers are saying ` the party 's over , ' '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LaLonde</ENAMEX> .
`` Shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation - cost savings as they have for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last eight or nine years</ENAMEX> .
Transport rates wo n't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Delaney</ENAMEX> , a consultant at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Arthur D. Little Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , said `` We 've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight - cost reductions .
Now we are starting to see real freight - rate increases as carriers replace equipment , pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor .
You 'll see carriers try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously . ''
Not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers .
`` There 's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerard McCullough</ENAMEX> , lecturer in transportation at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> .
Less - than - truckload companies , which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck trailer , discounted away a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7 %</ENAMEX> rate increase implemented <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last April</ENAMEX> .
The carriers were competing fiercely for market share .
Railroad - rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail - traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks .
An official at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Consolidated Freightways Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Menlo Park</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , less - than - truckload carrier , said rate discounting in that industry has begun to `` stabilize . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Consolidated Freightways</ENAMEX> plans to raise its rates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late this year</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early next year</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</ENAMEX> competitors have announced similar increases .
Truckers are `` trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Lloyd</ENAMEX> , an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salomon Bros</ENAMEX> .
And `` shippers are getting the feeling that they have played <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> trucker off against another as much as they can , '' he said .
Air - freight carriers raised their rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> products going across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Pacific</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this month</ENAMEX> .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Japan Air Lines</ENAMEX> said it plans to boost its rates a further <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next two years</ENAMEX> .
Such rate increases `` will increase the total cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> products and slow down the rate of increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> exports , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Connors</ENAMEX> , a senior vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yusen Air -AMP- Sea Service U.S.A. Inc.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> air - freight - forwarding subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nippon Yusen Kaisha</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
Ship companies carrying bulk commodities , such as oil , grain , coal and iron ore , have been able to increase their rates in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of years</ENAMEX> .
Some bulk shipping rates have increased `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 % to 4 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few months</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salomon</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX> .
And ship lines carrying containers are also trying to raise their rates .
Carriers boosted rates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the North Atlantic</ENAMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> last <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels .
Ship lines operating in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Pacific</ENAMEX> plan to raise rates on containers carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> exports to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 %</ENAMEX> , effective <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next April</ENAMEX> .
