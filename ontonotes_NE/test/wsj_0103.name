<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Labor Department</ENAMEX> cited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USX Corp.</ENAMEX> for numerous health and safety violations at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> plants , and proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.3 million</ENAMEX> in fines , the largest penalty ever proposed for alleged workplace violations by an employer .
The department 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</ENAMEX> proposed fines of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.1 million</ENAMEX> for alleged violations at the company 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairless Hills</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , steel mill ; that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OSHA</ENAMEX> cited <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 1,500</ENAMEX> alleged violations of federal electrical , crane - safety , record - keeping and other requirements .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> citation covering the company 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clairton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , coke works involved <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200</ENAMEX> alleged violations of electrical - safety and other requirements , for which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OSHA</ENAMEX> proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2 million</ENAMEX> in fines .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Labor</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Dole</ENAMEX> said , `` The magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health , and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OSHA</ENAMEX> said there have been <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> worker fatalities at the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> plants in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> deaths since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerard Scannell</ENAMEX> , the head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OSHA</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USX</ENAMEX> managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> , `` yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards . ''
`` Particularly flagrant , '' Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> said , `` are the company 's numerous failures to properly record injuries at its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairless</ENAMEX> works , in spite of the firm promise it had made in an earlier corporate - wide settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies . ''
That settlement was in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1987</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USX</ENAMEX> spokesman said the company had n't yet received any documents from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OSHA</ENAMEX> regarding the penalty or fine .
`` Once we do , they will receive very serious evaluation , '' the spokesman said .
`` No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USX</ENAMEX> said it has been cooperating with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OSHA</ENAMEX> since the agency began investigating the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clairton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairless</ENAMEX> works .
He said that , if and when safety problems were identified , they were corrected .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USX</ENAMEX> citations represented the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> sizable enforcement action taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OSHA</ENAMEX> under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scannell</ENAMEX> .
He has promised stiffer fines , though the size of penalties sought by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OSHA</ENAMEX> have been rising in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> even before he took office <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
`` The big problem is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USX</ENAMEX> management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to safeguarding safety and health in the plants , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Anku</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OSHA</ENAMEX> regional administrator in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USX</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">15 working days</ENAMEX> to contest the citations and proposed penalties , before the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission</ENAMEX> .
Before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USX</ENAMEX> case , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OSHA</ENAMEX> 's largest proposed fine for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> employer was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.3 million</ENAMEX> for alleged safety violations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">John Morrell -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , a meatpacking subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Brands Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> .
The company is contesting the fine .
