In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX> , where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism , they 're not laughing about their new leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Egon Krenz</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him .
`` You have to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes , '' says an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East German</ENAMEX> mother of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> who loves swapping political barbs with her friends .
`` With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> , we just do n't know what to expect . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> does n't seem to be the knee - jerk hardliner many initially thought he was when the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">52 - year - old</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Politburo</ENAMEX> member was selected <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> to succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erich Honecker</ENAMEX> .
But he does n't appear to be ready to make broad changes either .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ADN</ENAMEX> news agency , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> spoke to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> by telephone over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</ENAMEX> and acknowledged <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX> could learn from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> 's glasnost policies .
Already <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> started overhauling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany 's</ENAMEX> heavily censored and notoriously boring news media .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</ENAMEX> after he took office , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East German</ENAMEX> television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer .
The regular <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nightly</ENAMEX> news program and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> newspapers are also getting a visible injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> - style glasnost .
`` It was quite a shock , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">43 - year - old</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East German</ENAMEX> shopkeeper .
`` For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time in my life , I was n't sure whether I was listening to our news or <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> television . ''
Other changes , including easing restrictions on travel for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East Germans</ENAMEX> , are expected .
But whether such moves can win back the confidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East Germans</ENAMEX> , who have taken to the streets by the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</ENAMEX> to demand democratic changes , depends largely on whether they feel they can trust Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> .
And that 's a problem .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> is not only closely identified with his mentor , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> , but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</ENAMEX> and for praising <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> for sending tanks against student demonstrators .
`` I hope he grows with the job , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rainer Eppelmann</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Protestant</ENAMEX> pastor in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Berlin</ENAMEX> .
`` The most important thing is that he have a chance . ''
Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> is dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany 's</ENAMEX> conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades .
Unlike Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> , who tended to lecture people about socialist values , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> enjoys asking questions .
Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> and wander among the workers -- a la <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> .
He was later shown on television , fielding questions .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> point , he asked a worker whether he thought <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East Germans</ENAMEX> were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies .
The worker 's tart reply : `` It 's more than just travel .
People have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society . ''
The exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television footage to Western news agencies .
This same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> congressmen <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</ENAMEX> .
Rather than trying to `` lecture us , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> congressional aide who attended the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">two - hour</ENAMEX> meeting , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> `` wanted to listen . ''
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronnie Flippo</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the members of the delegation , says he was particularly impressed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> 's ready admission that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX> needed to change .
`` He 's a very tough man , but one who 's also open to arguments , '' adds an aide to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> Chancellor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX> .
But there 's another side to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> .
Born in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Baltic</ENAMEX> town in an area which is now part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> , he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus .
He moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his patron , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> , and emerged as the heir apparent .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Donovan</ENAMEX> , an expert on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Munich</ENAMEX> , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> may project a smooth image , but she doubts he 's a true reformer .
Even if he is , she adds , he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Communist Party 's</ENAMEX> ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Politburo</ENAMEX> .
Against this background , the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East German</ENAMEX> leader must move quickly to shore up his government 's standing .
The sudden growth of the opposition movement , together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> , has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="5">anti-Soviet</ENAMEX> workers ' uprising in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</ENAMEX> .
`` He does n't have any honeymoon period , '' says a Western diplomat based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Berlin</ENAMEX> .
`` But if he 's sharp and quick , he has a chance . ''
The diplomat adds that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> has several things going for him .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East German</ENAMEX> economy is strong compared with other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East bloc</ENAMEX> nations .
And his relative youth could help him project a more vibrant image , contrasting with the perception of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> as an out - of - touch old man .
For average <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East Germans</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> remains a puzzle .
`` Either he was n't being real in the past , or he is n't being real right now , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year - old</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East German</ENAMEX> doctor .
`` Either way , I have a problem with how quickly he 's changed . ''
The doctor was among <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</ENAMEX> of people milling through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Berlin 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gethsemane Church</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> .
The walls of the church are covered with leaflets , news clippings , and handwritten notes associated with the country 's political opposition .
`` I have to come here to read the walls , '' says the doctor , `` because it 's information I still ca n't get through the newspapers . ''
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany 's</ENAMEX> growing openness may even allow the state - controlled news media to display a muted sense of humor .
Television last week carried a new report on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Berlin 's</ENAMEX> main wallpaper factory and the need to boost production .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East Germans</ENAMEX> remember a comment <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Hager</ENAMEX> , the government 's top ideologist , that just because a neighbor hangs new wallpaper , there 's no reason to change your own .
His point was there is no reason for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX> to copy <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> - style changes .
`` It 's hard to know whether it was intended to be funny , '' says the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Berlin</ENAMEX> shopkeeper , `` But everyone I know laughed about it .
