The results of a news survey show the support for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South African</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thabo Mbeki</ENAMEX> is dropping .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Institute for Democracy in South Africa</ENAMEX> , which conducted the survey , found that only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">all South Africans</ENAMEX> approve of the way their President has handled his job .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Embeke</ENAMEX> has been widely criticized for questioning the causal link between HIV and AIDS in the face of a pandemic , which threatens to decimate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> the government announced that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South African</ENAMEX> President will be withdrawing from the public debate about AIDS .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">World</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carolyn Demster</ENAMEX> reports from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johannesburg</ENAMEX> on the saga , which has tainted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Embeke</ENAMEX> 's image .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Embeke</ENAMEX> 's personal interest in HIV and AIDS began during a <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">late night</ENAMEX> session surfing the Internet .
He located the views of dissident scientists who dispute the causal link between HIV and AIDS , solicited their opinions and then invited them to participate in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">a Presidential Advisory Panel</ENAMEX> of AIDS experts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South African</ENAMEX> scientists were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> to question the President 's meddling in a scientific debate , which they contended , was already over .
They were pressured into silence .
A declaration of the world 's foremost <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5000</ENAMEX> AIDS researchers and scientists , stating unequivocally that HIV leads to AIDS was contemptuously dismissed as fit only for the dustbin by the President 's spokesman , and then in a bid to clarify his stance , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Embeke</ENAMEX> addressed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parliament</ENAMEX> on the matter .
The program of the government in this country is based on the thesis that HIV causes AIDS .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Embeke</ENAMEX> did n't stop there .
AIDS is Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome .
It 's a sensible thing to ask - Does <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> virus cause a syndrome ?
A virus can not cause a syndrome , and AIDS is a syndrome .
It might be a case of pure semantics but the President has resolutely refused to say clearly that HIV causes AIDS .
He has accused his critics of racism when they point to unsafe sexual practices and the high incidents of rape in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> to explain why an estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1700</ENAMEX> more people are infected with the HI virus <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">everyday</ENAMEX> .
The ensuing public debate has left <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South Africans</ENAMEX> , many of them uneducated and illiterate , confused and helpless .
Here at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Berthwana Hospital 's</ENAMEX> anti-natal clinic on the outskirts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Suheto</ENAMEX> the extent of the problem is frightening .
This is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> 's largest hospital and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> the wards fill with patients with AIDS related illnesses .
In the anti-natal clinic <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">slightly less than a third</ENAMEX> of pregnant women test positive for the HI virus .
Their only hope for their unborn children is to sign up for a trial research program .
This means they will be treated free of charge with antiretroviral drugs , which , have been proven in clinical trials elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> to dramatically reduce the risk of mother to child transmission , but to date the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South African</ENAMEX> government has refused to provide the drugs at state hospitals arguing that they are too expensive .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florencen Gubeni</ENAMEX> is a counselor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the HIV AIDS Peri-natal Research Unit</ENAMEX> .
She is HIV positive and also lost her child to AIDS , and she is angry with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Embeke</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> man that we believe that he can make a difference by saying something positive and being , he 's the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> person who does n't understand whether HIV does cause AIDS .
So of course though we follow him .
he 's the President .
he 's the man .
he 's black , you know , and HIV in reality is affecting a lot of black men and they will take his statement , and that 's what we see that men are starting to say , ' We are men , We do n't have HIV , Even our President says so , Why should we use condoms ? You women are the ones who have HIV , Do it , It 's your own will . '
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florencen Gubeni</ENAMEX> also says the President 's attitude has made her job as an AIDS educator doubly difficult , especially persuading men to wear condoms .
I really appreciate for him to admit personally that he has made a mistake .
He has said something that has caused a lot of confusion .
But President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Embeke</ENAMEX> is n't backing down .
He is reported to have said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the US Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> was conspiring to promote the thesis that HIV causes AIDS , this in order to boost the profits of major pharmaceutical companies which manufacture antiretroviral drugs .
He also alleged that this is part of a wider plot to undermine both him as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa 's</ENAMEX> attempts to obtain a more equitable world economic order .
Conspiracy theories aside , the reality is that hundreds of thousands of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South Africans</ENAMEX> are suffering and dying needlessly in vivid contrast to developing nations like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> where the governments have adopted a pro-active role in manufacturing low - cost antiretroviral drugs and are running highly successful AIDS education and condom campaigns .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The World</ENAMEX> I 'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carolyn Demster</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johannesburg</ENAMEX> .
