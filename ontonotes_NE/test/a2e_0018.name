<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talal</ENAMEX>
Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings
Yes , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> was able to prove to the world the stupidity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafida</ENAMEX> .
Do n't you agree with me that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Safavid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafida</ENAMEX> revealed to the world their stupidity when they showed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> in general , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> in particular , their hidden hatred and limitless detestation , and revealed their dirty plans and policy .
Yes , they are stupid because they revealed their true colors and proved to all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> that there are plans for major loathing and hatred for all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> in the world .
Yes , they are stupid otherwise what is the benefit of executing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> at this time ?
For <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> , there was no difference whether he was executed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> or on a feast day or otherwise .
Yes , they are stupid because they did not harm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> but themselves , as they revealed their wickedness , their cunning and their coming danger and to all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Moslems</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> .
They were so ensconced in their deep hatred that they did not observe <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the holy months</ENAMEX> or at least the rule of law .
Yes , they revealed to all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> peoples in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algeria</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tunisia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> their treachery , loathing and hatred for them .
The idiots gained nothing but the hatred of the nations for them .
Rather they made <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> a believing martyred hero .
Why are we sad ?
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> did not like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> and were not happy with many of his deeds , but after his execution in this way everybody sympathized with him .
No one blames <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> for what he did with those traitors , sons of temporary marriages , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Safavids</ENAMEX> , whose noses he rubbed in the ground .
Yes , these traitors proved that no one but a ruler like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> can make them act straight and control them .
Why do we grieve for a man whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">last</ENAMEX> words were " I bear witness that there is no God but God and I bear witness that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muhammad</ENAMEX> is the prophet of God . "
All witnessed the execution of the genius brave leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> , and witnessed his bravery .
Those <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Safavid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafida</ENAMEX> crowded together in front of him , cursing and mocking him as if they were children .
But he stood pround and strong as we were used to him being .
I swear by God if any of these traitors had been in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein 's</ENAMEX> place you would have seen him weeping , begging or at least fainting more than once .
These idiots did not know that they had made a martyred , believing hero out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> .
They only proved to the world his bravery and his might and , on the other hand , they proved to the world their hidden hatred and their lack of manners .
The mentally deranged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moqtada Perfidy</ENAMEX> -LRB- one becomes aware that he is a child if he speaks -RRB- also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al - Hakim</ENAMEX> -LRB- the greatly malicious one -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Jaafari</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Maliki</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muwaffaq al - Rubaei</ENAMEX> and many of those traitors were also preent so that they could satisfy their thirst for revenge on a leader whose bravery and struggle the world attested . and who suppressed those traitors who only worked for the interests of a hostile foreign state -LRB- such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Why this mockery and shouting of petty slogans such as " <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> go to hell " and " down with the tyrant " and others ?
Was n't there a sensible man amongst them ?
Yes , those <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Persian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Safavids</ENAMEX> proved without doubt to the world that they do not use reason in their dealings , but that they deal in hate and loathing .
Yes , those idiots proved that they are behind everything that is happening to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and all this is no one 's setup but theirs .
Do n't those stupid traitor <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Safavid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafida</ENAMEX> collaborators know that they have not hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> but themselves ?
For they proved to the world that they are a stupid people , a people of hate , a people who loath the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> all over the world .
We know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> was not ever a traitor or lackey but that he was a brave militant leader and died a martyr .
We know that an offer was made to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> to save his skin , leave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and live as a political refugee in any state he wanted but he considered it a betrayal and continued struggling until he was martyred .
We know the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> offered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> his release when a prisoner , to go to any state he wished in return for stopping the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mujahideen</ENAMEX> but he refused and considered it a betrayal .
We know that whoever overthrew <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> was none other than your crusader masters and that you are too small to overthrow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> , and that you are nothing but lackey traitor scum .
We know that your hatred of your master and executioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> only comes from the fact that he is someone who knew how to keep you in check and trampled on your necks with his shoes for more than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thirty</ENAMEX> years .
That 's why all nations of the world do not blame <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> at all , and realize that it was the hidden hand of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafida</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Persians</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> that were behind what happened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Halabja</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> struck them with a fist of iron .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafida</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Persians</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> were the hidden hand in the assassination attempt against him in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dujail</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> struck them with a fist of iron .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafida</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Persians</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> were the hidden hand behind the failed coup attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">'91</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> struck them with a fist of iron .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafida</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Persians</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> were the hidden hand behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">al - Khobar</ENAMEX> explosion in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">'96</ENAMEX> and also <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Lebanon War</ENAMEX> in as well as the current sectarian war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
Only an ignorant human being would blame <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> .
Praise be to God that the way of executing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> was the most clear message to all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> leaders and peoples that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafida</ENAMEX> and sons of temporary marriages are evil and danger has come near , take care , take care .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">last</ENAMEX> words before his martyrdom spoken to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafida</ENAMEX> present in front of him .
Hurray ... this is what real manliness is !
Especially as those <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">magi</ENAMEX> did not begin to shout until the rope was placed around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> 's neck -LRB- all of this was of course cowardice and terror of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lion</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
May God have mercy on you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> and forgive you .
-LRB- Glory be to the Lord and praise , glory be to the Lord Almighty -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibn Malik</ENAMEX>
May God lead you on the right way , brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talal</ENAMEX> ...
By God , their stupidity was well - known before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> .
Just read their books to find out how similar they are to the greedy banana - eaters .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibn Malek</ENAMEX> Thank you for passing by .
Glory be to the Lord and praise , glory be to the Lord Almighty
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talal</ENAMEX>
To the descendents of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Magi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafida</ENAMEX> everywhere -LRB- starting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allawi</ENAMEX> and his putrid gang to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Maliki</ENAMEX> , and passing through their mullahs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khomeini</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Sistani</ENAMEX> - and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baqir</ENAMEX> - to the last dirty <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of them .
They taught us that we should not extend them our hands although they said we are all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Moslems</ENAMEX> .. and that if we debate them each of us needs to take his shoes with him ... as you ca n't be safe from their deceit and their thievery .
Those unclean abominations ... they are not governed by conscience nor religion nor custom nor morals , anyone who wants to feel safe with them has to feel safe from the bite of the snake in its own hole .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miqdad</ENAMEX> your words are beautiful .
Glory be to the Lord and praise , glory be to the Lord Almighty
