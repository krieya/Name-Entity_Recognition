-LRB- During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">its centennial year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past century</ENAMEX> that stand as milestones of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> business history . -RRB-
PLASTIC PENCILS , CODE - NAMED <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E - 71</ENAMEX> , made their hush - hush debut in children 's pencil boxes at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> - and - dime stores in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</ENAMEX> .
But few knew it then and most still think all pencils are wooden .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eagle Pencil</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shelbyville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenn.</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pencil City U.S.A.</ENAMEX> , '' had made its earliest pilot plastic pencils in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</ENAMEX> .
But it was n't until after it hired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Arthur D. Little</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , research concern , that its new product was refined for commercial sale in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">A.D.L.</ENAMEX> inventors applied <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 6 , 1973</ENAMEX> , for the patent , which was assigned and awarded in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hasbro Industries</ENAMEX> , then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eagle</ENAMEX> 's parent .
Pencil pushers chew and put the plastic models behind their ears just like traditional pencils made of glued strips of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> incense cedar filled with ceramic lead .
It takes <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> steps to make standard pencils , just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> for the plastic type .
Automated machines coextrude long plastic sheaths with graphite - plastic cores that are printed , cut , painted and eraser - fitted .
`` After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 200 years</ENAMEX> , something new has happened to pencils , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Arthur D. Little</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</ENAMEX> report that publicly described the previously secret item .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eagle</ENAMEX> 's plastic type sharpens and looks like a wooden pencil .
A major difference is that a snapped wooden pencil will have a slivered break while a plastic model will break cleanly .
The softness of the core constrains the plastic models to No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> , No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> or No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</ENAMEX> - type pencils , which account for the bulk of the market .
Artists and draftsmen need harder `` leads . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eagle</ENAMEX> , now called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eagle - Berol</ENAMEX> , remains a leading company among the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> that produced <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2.3 billion</ENAMEX> pencils <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Pencil Makers Association</ENAMEX> .
It 's a trade secret how many were plastic , and most writers still do n't know what they 're using .
