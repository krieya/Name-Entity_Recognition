Another Business Trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Zhou</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Next week</ENAMEX> , I will go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - day</ENAMEX> business trip .
I have no choice but to go .
My wife will have a hard time again at home .
We plan to make dumplings and steamed buns on weekend to be used as food reserve for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> .
On this trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , I plan to pay a visit to my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cisco</ENAMEX> colleagues and friends .
They all moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> from RTP for different reasons .
It 's so hard to make a hotel reservation .
I do n't know whether it is because of an upcoming big conference , all hotels in the <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 - mile</ENAMEX> radius from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX> have been booked up .
I could only find a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sheraton</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pleasant</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 miles</ENAMEX> from the company .
I must make sure to bring my own GPS before I set out in case there is no GPS in the rental car .
