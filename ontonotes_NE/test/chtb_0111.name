<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Xinhua News Agency</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 13th</ENAMEX> , by reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xisheng</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou</ENAMEX>
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , a large number of foreign enterprises of great strength and great developmental vision have entered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
According to statistics , currently , foreign enterprises listed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> have reached <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 340</ENAMEX> , tripling the figure <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years ago</ENAMEX> .
According to presentations by people from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '90's</ENAMEX> , big enterprises entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> market were mainly from economically developed countries in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , etc. , but things have changed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
The number of non-governmental enterprises from countries in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Central and South America</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX> , etc. , that have come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> to enter the market has distinctly increased .
Powerful enterprises from developing countries in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle and Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , etc. are beginning to be listed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
Currently , the number of countries and regions whose enterprises are listed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 50</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , there were <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</ENAMEX> foreign enterprises recently listed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , creating the highest record in the history .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">145</ENAMEX> types of stocks were recently listed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , of which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42 %</ENAMEX> were issued by foreign enterprises .
On the basis of analysis , the main reason why so many foreign enterprises are listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> securities exchange market is the continuous and steady increase of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> economy , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> is a relatively ideal place for raising capital , with its strict management and regulated operation .
Statistics show that , capital that foreign enterprises raised on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> has reached <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">60 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> .
But financial experts from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wall Street</ENAMEX> warn that , foreign enterprises entering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , to a large extent , means that these enterprises need to adopt the strict operations and financial management methods of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> .
If foreign enterprises still lack the conditions to apply these methods , they should not rush blindly to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> market , lest they be left out in the cold .
