The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> government introduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House of Commons</ENAMEX> legislation to extend federal regulatory authority over provincial government - owned telephone utilities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saskatchewan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manitoba</ENAMEX> .
The legislation would open the way for more telephone services and more competition in the telephone business in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> provinces , federal officials said .
The federal government initiative follows a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decision that held that the major telephone companies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saskatchewan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manitoba</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Atlantic</ENAMEX> coast provinces were interprovincial undertakings and subject to federal legislative authority .
Prior to the ruling the federal government had regulated only the telephone companies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quebec</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Northwest Territories</ENAMEX> .
The governments of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saskatchewan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manitoba</ENAMEX> have strongly opposed federal regulation of their telephone companies .
The extension of federal regulatory authority over telephone utilities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Atlantic</ENAMEX> provinces has n't required special legislation because they are investor - owned .
