Influential members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings - and - loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts .
The bill , whose backers include Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ill.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , would prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX> from raising temporary working capital by having an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTC</ENAMEX> - owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget .
The bill intends to restrict the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTC</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization .
`` Such agency ` self - help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> borrowing , '' said Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fortney Stark</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the bill 's chief sponsor .
The complex financing plan in the S-AMP-L bailout law includes raising <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 billion</ENAMEX> from debt issued by the newly created <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTC</ENAMEX> .
This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">Another $ 20 billion</ENAMEX> would be raised through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds , which pay lower interest rates .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTC</ENAMEX> also requires `` working '' capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately .
That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 billion</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 166 billion</ENAMEX> including interest over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Cooke</ENAMEX> , executive director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTC</ENAMEX> .
The agency has already spent <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $ 19 billion</ENAMEX> selling <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</ENAMEX> insolvent S-AMP-Ls , and it is likely to sell or merge <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</ENAMEX> by the time the bailout concludes .
Absent other working capital , he said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTC</ENAMEX> would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets .
`` We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward , '' he said .
The complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight .
The law does allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTC</ENAMEX> to borrow from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $ 5 billion</ENAMEX> at any time .
Moreover , it says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTC</ENAMEX> 's total obligations may not exceed <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 billion</ENAMEX> , but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt , and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTC</ENAMEX> holds .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> did n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say opponents of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTC</ENAMEX> 's working - capital plan , and Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Schumer</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y .</ENAMEX> -RRB- said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the RTC Oversight Board</ENAMEX> has been remiss in not keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> informed .
`` That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ways and Means</ENAMEX> , which seems to me sort of draconian , '' he said .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTC</ENAMEX> is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hill</ENAMEX> if they want that kind of flexibility . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> will hold a hearing on the bill <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next Tuesday</ENAMEX> .
