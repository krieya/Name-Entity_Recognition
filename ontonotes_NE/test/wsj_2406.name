It was n't so long ago that a radio network funded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> -- and originally by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> -- was accused by officials here of employing propagandists , imperialists and spies .
Now , the network has opened a news bureau in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hungarian</ENAMEX> capital .
Employees held an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Szabad Europa Radio</ENAMEX> '' -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> .
`` I think this is a victory for the radio , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnabas de Bueky</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">55 - year - old</ENAMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hungarian</ENAMEX> refugee who works in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Munich</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> , headquarters as deputy director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hungarian</ENAMEX> service .
In fact , the network hopes to set up offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> and anywhere else in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the East Bloc</ENAMEX> that will have it .
But the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the network 's life in more ways than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> .
In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> is in danger of suffering from its success .
While the network currently can operate freely in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> , so can others .
In addition , competition for listeners is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled .
Instead of being denounced as an evil agent of imperialism , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame , even boring .
`` They have a lot to do <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> to compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hungarian</ENAMEX> radio , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Deak</ENAMEX> , a computer - science student at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Technical University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hungarian</ENAMEX> -LCB- radio -RCB- reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what 's going on here . ''
Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> is in the midst of a media explosion .
Boys on busy street corners peddle newspapers of every political stripe .
Newsstands are packed with a colorful array of magazines .
Radio and television are getting livelier and bolder .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The British Broadcasting Corp.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State Department</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Voice of America</ENAMEX> broadcast over <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hungarian</ENAMEX> airwaves , though <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">only a few hours a day each</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hungarian</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Australian</ENAMEX> press magnate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX> has bought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> popular and gossipy <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hungarian</ENAMEX> newspapers , while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Maxwell</ENAMEX> has let it be known here that he is thinking about similar moves .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> does n't plan to fade away .
With its mission for free speech and the capitalist way , the network 's staff says it still has plenty to do -- in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the `` Great Eastern Beyond</ENAMEX> . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> and its sister station for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Liberty</ENAMEX> , say they wo n't cut back their <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">more than 19 hours</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> broadcasts .
They are still an important source of news for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 million</ENAMEX> listeners in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</ENAMEX> exotic tongues : from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Bulgarian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Belorussian</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Kazakh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Kirghiz</ENAMEX> .
The establishment of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> bureau in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Warsaw Pact</ENAMEX> territory shows the depth of some of the changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Months</ENAMEX> before the decision by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Communist Party</ENAMEX> to rename itself <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Socialist</ENAMEX> and try to look more appealing to voters , the country 's rulers were trying to look more hospitable .
It proved a perfect time for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> to ask for permission to set up office .
Not only did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ENAMEX> approve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Free Europe 's</ENAMEX> new location , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Telecommunications</ENAMEX> did something even more amazing : `` They found us <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> phone lines in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geza Szocs</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> correspondent who helped organize the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> location .
`` That is a miracle . ''
It 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network , which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents -LRB- who filed reports to the network by phone , secret messengers or letters -RRB- .
In fact , some of the network 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hungarian</ENAMEX> listeners say they owe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> writer here calls <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the `` Dark Ages of the 20th Century</ENAMEX> . ''
`` During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past four years</ENAMEX> , many of us have sat up until late at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> listening to our radios , '' says the writer .
`` There were some very brave broadcasts . ''
The listeners , too , had to be brave .
Through much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT" S_OFF="5">post-World War II</ENAMEX> period , listening to Western broadcasts was a crime in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> .
`` When we listen to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> station , my mother still gets nervous , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> translator .
`` She wants to turn down the volume and close the curtains . ''
Now , the toughest competition for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> comes during the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">late - night</ENAMEX> slot .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hungarian</ENAMEX> radio often saves its most politically outspoken broadcasts for around <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</ENAMEX> .
Television , which most of the time is considered rather tame , has entered the running with a new program , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The End of the Day</ENAMEX> , '' which comes on after <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">11 p.m</ENAMEX> .
It is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> 's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs .
Those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> for `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sunday Journal</ENAMEX> , '' on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hungarian Radio</ENAMEX> .
The competitive spirit is clearly influencing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> , which is trying to beef up programs .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> office plans to hire free - lance reporters to cover the latest happenings in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hungarian</ENAMEX> country towns from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagykanizsa</ENAMEX> in the west to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nyiregyhaza</ENAMEX> in the east .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hungarian</ENAMEX> service has a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">40 - minute</ENAMEX> news show called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Newsreel</ENAMEX> , with international and domestic news , plus a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> news review of opinions from around the world .
There 's also a host of new programs , trying to lighten up on the traditional diet of politics .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">35 - minute</ENAMEX> program called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The March of Time ''</ENAMEX> tries to find interesting tidbits of lighthearted news and gossip from around the world .
There 's a program for women and a science show .
And to attract younger listeners , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> intersperses the latest in Western rock groups .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Pet Shop Boys</ENAMEX> are big <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> .
`` We are starving for all the news , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deak</ENAMEX> , the student .
`` Every moment we want to know everything about the world .
