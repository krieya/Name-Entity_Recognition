The suit , filed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> federal court , claims that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Apple</ENAMEX> violated a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Quickview</ENAMEX> patent that allows computer users to display `` only portions of multiple fields on a computer screen with the ability to see the entire contents of any given field . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HyperCard</ENAMEX> program allows users to design applications for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Macintosh</ENAMEX> computers without having to be hardcore programmers and is distributed with every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Macintosh</ENAMEX> sold .
It 's one of the most popular computer programs of all time , but analysts said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Quickview</ENAMEX> suit does n't appear to bode major difficulties for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Apple</ENAMEX> .
The technology at issue `` is not an underlying technology of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HyperCard</ENAMEX> to my knowledge , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Goodman</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> - area <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HyperCard</ENAMEX> program developer .
Nonetheless , the suit seeks unspecified damages that an attorney for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Quickview</ENAMEX> claimed could run into <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">the millions of dollars</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cupertino</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Apple</ENAMEX> said that it believes the case has no merit , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HyperCard</ENAMEX> does not infringe `` any valid claims '' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Quickview</ENAMEX> patents .
It said it filed an action of its own in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , seeking a declaration that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Quickview</ENAMEX> 's claims are invalid .
