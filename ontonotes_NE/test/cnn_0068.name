Secret new evidence has prompted another delay in the trial of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Libyans</ENAMEX> accused of bombing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pan Am Flight 103</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Mintier</ENAMEX> has details .
Already in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">its sixth month</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> trial of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Libyans</ENAMEX> accused of blowing up <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pan Am Flight 103</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">12 years ago</ENAMEX> is moving at a snail 's pace .
The latest series of delays come as new information has been revealed to the defense by the prosecution .
Such a move in the middle of a trial is considered highly unusual unless the information is so sensitive it could harm the case if not revealed during the trial .
The information includes details of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> new potential witnesses and other information from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> countries on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> different continents .
It is not yet clear whether the new information will help or hurt the case against the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Libyans</ENAMEX> accused of blowing up the airplane .
Prosecutors have handed over a file described in court as being <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an inch</ENAMEX> thick .
Defense lawyers say the new information , if true , will have the greatest conceivable effect on the trial .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two weeks ago</ENAMEX> , prosecutors revealed the existence of the new information and just this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> , handed it over to defense lawyers .
Teams of investigators have now fanned out to conduct interviews related to this new information for the defense team .
That information could cause the trial to be delayed even further .
The defense team has already told the court that more time may be required to react to the new information .
So far , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Scottish</ENAMEX> judges sitting to hear this case have not been told any of the details of the new information .
That may change <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> if and when another delay in the trial is requested by the defense .
Just how important is the new information ?
That is difficult to say , because so far , only investigators and lawyers for the defense and prosection know what it is .
In court on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the lawyers for the defense defended all the secrecy saying , `` lives are in danger . ''
At one time , there were predictions that this trial would be completed before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> elections for President .
Now it is looking more likely to spill into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the new year</ENAMEX> , but no one is exactly willing to say which <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">new year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Mintier</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Camp Zeist</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Netherlands</ENAMEX> .
