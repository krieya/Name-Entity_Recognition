<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mobil Corp.</ENAMEX> is in the midst of cutting back its exploration and production group , which finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 15 %</ENAMEX> as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business .
Management advised employees <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</ENAMEX> people .
The exploration side of the unit has recently undergone a similar overhaul , during which it also lost <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 400</ENAMEX> employees , a company spokesman said in response to questions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mobil Exploration -AMP- Producing U.S. Inc.</ENAMEX> , the group involved , currently has a work force of somewhat <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than 5,000</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mobil</ENAMEX> restructured the entire company during an industrywide shakeout .
But since then <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> oil production has declined and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mobil</ENAMEX> wants to focus its oil - finding efforts overseas .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mobil</ENAMEX> alluded to the work - force cuts <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> when it took a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</ENAMEX> charge as part of its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">third - quarter</ENAMEX> earnings and attributed it to a restructuring .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mobil</ENAMEX> officials said that it is unlikely any additional charges related to this move will be taken in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">future quarters</ENAMEX> .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mobil</ENAMEX> will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> production operation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mobil</ENAMEX> officials said they have been studying ways of streamlining these operations since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early this year</ENAMEX> .
During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming months</ENAMEX> , layers of management will be peeled away and regional offices will become more autonomous .
For greater efficiency , employees at those locations will be reorganized into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mobil</ENAMEX> said .
`` The main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles E. Spruell</ENAMEX> , president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mobil</ENAMEX> unit .
Field offices at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Midland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tex.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bakersfield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Liberal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kan.</ENAMEX> , will be maintained .
But the staffs at some of those locations will be slashed while at others the work force will be increased .
For instance , employment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> will be reduced to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">430</ENAMEX> .
But on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the West Coast</ENAMEX> , where profitable oil production is more likely than in the midcontinent region , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bakersfield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , office staff of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</ENAMEX> will grow by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">305</ENAMEX> .
The reorganization will `` focus on the value and potential of assets , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spruell</ENAMEX> said .
