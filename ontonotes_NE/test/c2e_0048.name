<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freezing the moments</ENAMEX> : Days When We are Busy Gathering .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freezing the moments</ENAMEX>
Seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Year of the Dog</ENAMEX> going by one day after another and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Spring Festival</ENAMEX> approaching , we are busy greeting the advent of the " golden pig " and busy gathering with colleagues , friends and schoolmates .
We <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> have had no time virtually to have a quiet dinner at home ever since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> .
It was often deep night when we were back home !
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tutu</ENAMEX> went to a regular monthly gathering at the club again <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
I learned from his call that many people were there this time and even some of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hali</ENAMEX> 's friends went .
Brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jia</ENAMEX> will go back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
They say we should be really high , and it seems god knows when we will be back home !
I can not be idle either and directly went to the department store to enjoy myself !
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LYSH</ENAMEX> will be off on his/her home leave from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> and wo n't be back until after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Spring Festival</ENAMEX> .
He/She can rest for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a month</ENAMEX> altogether .
How envious I am !
I would laugh to death if I could have such long vacation each year !
