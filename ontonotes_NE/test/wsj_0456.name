It can be hoped that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Spanish</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe Gonzalez</ENAMEX> will draw the right conclusion from his narrow election victory <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> .
A strong challenge from the far left , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communist</ENAMEX> coalition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Izquierda Unida</ENAMEX> , failed to topple him .
He should consider his victory a mandate to continue his growth - oriented economic reforms and not a demand that he move further left .
If he follows the correct path , he may be able to look back on this election as the high - water mark of far - left opposition .
The far left had some good issues even if it did not have good programs for dealing with them .
It could point to plenty of ailments that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Spanish</ENAMEX> economic rejuvenation so far has failed to cure .
Unemployment still is officially recorded at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.5 %</ENAMEX> , the highest rate in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , although actual joblessness may be lower .
Housing is scarce and public services -- the court system , schools , mail service , telephone network and the highways -- are in disgraceful condition .
Large pockets of poverty still exist .
The left also is critical of the style of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Socialist</ENAMEX> government -- a remarkable parallel to the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> and his colleagues , particularly the finance minister , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Solchaga</ENAMEX> , are charged with having abandoned their socialist principles and with having become arrogant elitists who refuse even to go on television -LRB- controlled by the state -RRB- to face their accusers .
In response to this , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Socialist</ENAMEX> prime minister has simply cited his free - market accomplishments .
They are very considerable : Since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Community</ENAMEX> , its gross domestic product has grown at an annual average of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</ENAMEX> -- the fastest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> .
In that time <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1.2 million</ENAMEX> jobs have been created and the official jobless rate has been pushed below <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21 %</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</ENAMEX> inflation rate dropped below <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> .
Net foreign investment through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> has been running at a pace of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12.5 billion</ENAMEX> , about double the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year - earlier</ENAMEX> rate .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> also has split with the left in reaffirming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> commitment and in renewing a defense treaty with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> is not quite a closet supply - side revolutionary , however .
He did not go as far as he could have in tax reductions ; indeed he combined them with increases in indirect taxes .
Yet the best the far - left could do was not enough to deter the biggest voting bloc -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 40 %</ENAMEX> -- from endorsing the direction <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> is taking .
Now he can go further .
He should do more to reduce tax rates on wealth and income , in recognition of the fact that those cuts yield higher , not lower , revenues .
He could do more to cut public subsidies and transfers , thus making funds available for public services starved of money for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</ENAMEX> .
The voters delivered Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> mandate for his successes .
They , as well as numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Latin American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East European</ENAMEX> countries that hope to adopt elements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Spanish</ENAMEX> model , are supporting the direction <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> is taking .
It would be sad for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> to abandon them to appease his foes .
