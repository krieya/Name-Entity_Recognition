Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rajiv Gandhi</ENAMEX> set a date <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</ENAMEX> for general elections that some analysts say could cost him and his ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress -LRB- I -RRB- Party</ENAMEX> control of the government .
Other analysts say the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> leader could retain control with a slim majority or be forced to rule as the dominant partner in a coalition with other parties .
Elections in this large , diverse and passionate nation are always hard to predict .
Much depends on the opposition , a loose group of regional and ideological parties led by former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> cabinet minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vishwanath Pratap Singh</ENAMEX> .
The biggest certainty is that the elections will be a vote for or against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> in power -- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> of ups and downs , promises and disappointments and wide fluctuations in popularity .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</ENAMEX> after an unusual parliamentary defeat for the ruling party , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> called elections for the lower house of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parliament</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 22</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">24</ENAMEX> .
The elections will be held in different states on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the two days</ENAMEX> .
-LRB- The lower house 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year term</ENAMEX> expires in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parliament</ENAMEX> 's upper house is appointed . -RRB-
The elections will be a rigorous test for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">45 - year - old</ENAMEX> prime minister and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- , which in various forms has ruled for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">42 years</ENAMEX> of independence .
After a landslide win in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> in polls held after the assassination of his mother , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Indira Gandhi</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> saw his popularity begin a roller coaster ride .
His <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early</ENAMEX> promises to make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> a modern nation remain bogged down in bloated bureaucracy .
His pledge to clean up local administration and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> politics , including his own party , went unfulfilled .
His `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr. Clean</ENAMEX> '' image was muddied by an arms - kickback scandal , which will be a major campaign issue .
Some analysts predict that disappointment in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> 's spent pledge to reduce corruption and heavy - handed local government will crest at the polls .
`` There 's a wide feeling of indignation across the country , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bhabani Sen Gupta</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Center for Policy Research</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Delhi</ENAMEX> .
`` I think the people will be judging the regime by a petty policeman , by a corrupt revenue collector .
This could be a big protest against an administrative failure . ''
Even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- retains control of the government , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> 's ability to push through major initiatives might be hobbled by a thinner majority .
Economic analysts call his trail - blazing liberalization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> economy incomplete , and many are hoping for major new liberalizations if he is returned firmly to power .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The Lok Sabha</ENAMEX> , or lower house of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parliament</ENAMEX> , has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">542</ENAMEX> elected and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> appointed seats .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- captured <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">405</ENAMEX> seats , the largest victory in the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> democracy .
The landslide was fueled by panic that prevailed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> at the time .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> had been assassinated by separatist <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sikhs</ENAMEX> , and many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indians</ENAMEX> feared their country might split apart .
In the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> general elections , similar national issues clinched the vote .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Congress Party</ENAMEX> won after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> 's victory in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Bangladesh war</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</ENAMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> was thrown out of office after her <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">19 - month</ENAMEX> emergency rule , and in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> , after her successors made a mess of their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> in power , she was restored to office .
Most political analysts say that if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> 's opposition unites to field single candidates in most precincts , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- will lose big .
But if the opposition remains fractured , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- could win a small majority , or lead a coalition government .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chimanbhai Mehta</ENAMEX> , a parliamentarian and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> ally , predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- will win <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 150</ENAMEX> seats , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a quarter</ENAMEX> of the house , if the opposition fields single candidates in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</ENAMEX> of the races .
Analysts say the opposition will struggle <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> to unite , and its success will be clear only when it announces its final list of parliamentary candidates .
The arms - kickback scandal is likely to be one of the big talking points in the campaign , but it 's unclear how it is viewed by average <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> voters .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> signed a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.4 billion</ENAMEX> contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AB Bofors</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nobel Industries Sweden AB</ENAMEX> , to purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</ENAMEX> artillery pieces .
The contract was negotiated by the countries ' <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> prime ministers , and was supposed to be free of commissions or agents ' costs .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1987</ENAMEX> , evidence surfaced that commissions were paid .
The opposition charged that the money was used to bribe <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> government officials , an allegation denied by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> 's administration .
But many of his statements on the issue in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parliament</ENAMEX> subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence .
The scandal has faded and flared , but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages , and that has helped galvanize the opposition , which <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> blocked passage of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> constitutional amendment bills .
It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</ENAMEX> that such government bills were defeated .
In a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone , a job , and even into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">school</ENAMEX> , the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bofors</ENAMEX> has become a potent rallying cry against the government .
That illustrates the kind of disappointment many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indians</ENAMEX> feel toward Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> , whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">his first two years</ENAMEX> in power .
His term has produced no spectacular failures in politics , in the economy or on the military front , and has chalked up some successes .
But the average <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> had tremendous hope in the youthful leader and his promise to make both government and the ruling party more effective and less corrupt .
His failures in those <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> areas deeply , and sometimes bitterly , disappointed many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indians</ENAMEX> .
`` We do n't like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sooraji Jath</ENAMEX> , a farmer in the western state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gujarat</ENAMEX> .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> government is taking the farmers ' bread and not giving us any support .
When there are well problems , light problems , road problems , the government tells us to forget it . ''
The greatest thing going for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- Party</ENAMEX> is the poor reputation of the opposition .
Even if it unites for the elections , its coherence is likely to be temporary .
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- lost the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</ENAMEX> election , following Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> 's hated emergency rule , a similar coalition took power and then disintegrated .
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indians</ENAMEX> fear a repeat of that experience .

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AB Bofors</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nobel Industries Sweden AB</ENAMEX> , enters into a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.4 billion</ENAMEX> contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Defense Ministry</ENAMEX> to supply <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bofors</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FH - 77B 155 - mm</ENAMEX> field howitzer guns .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> , Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rajiv Gandhi</ENAMEX> , in his talks with then <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Swedish</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olof Palme</ENAMEX> , imposed the condition that the contract have no middlemen .

The report says that investigations were severely hampered by lack of cooperation from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bofors</ENAMEX> .
