<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's of London</ENAMEX> said it plans to clamp down on the ability of underwriting syndicates to leave their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> accounts open beyond the customary <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> .
Underwriting syndicates at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> , the world 's largest insurance market , generally do n't close their accounts for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> , to allow for the filing of claims and litigation .
When such claims and litigation extend beyond the period , the syndicates can extend their accounting deadlines .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> said there are currently <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">115 open account years</ENAMEX> involving <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</ENAMEX> of the market 's roughly <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</ENAMEX> syndicates .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">open - year</ENAMEX> accounting practice `` is widely recognized within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> as of serious concern '' to the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31,329</ENAMEX> member investors , who underwrite insurance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> in return for premium and investment income , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> said .
The procedure causes `` great uncertainty '' because an investor ca n't be sure of his or her individual liability , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> said .
As a result , the insurance market plans new measures to restrict the ability of syndicate officials to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> open .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> said it expects to enact new rules mandating the changes by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year end</ENAMEX> .
Under the new rules , the officials will have to secure additional information and reports from actuaries , including an assessment of whether officials have acted reasonably .
In addition , officials will have to get quotes for certain reinsurance contracts and obtain approvals from other syndicate directors .
