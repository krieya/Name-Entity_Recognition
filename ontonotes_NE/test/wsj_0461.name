<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Treasury Department</ENAMEX> proposed that banks be required to keep detailed records of international wire transfers , which officials believe is the main vehicle used by drug traffickers to move <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</ENAMEX> in and out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
In recent testimony on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> officials said they were considering the new reporting requirements , and the expected publication of the proposal in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Register</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> official step toward creating final regulations .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> is still working out the details with bank trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">associations</ENAMEX> and the other government agencies that have a hand in fighting money laundering .
Among the possibilities the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> is considering are requirements that banks keep records identifying the originators and recipients of international wire transfers .
Another suggestion would draw banks more directly into tracking down money launderers by developing a `` suspicious international wire transfer profile , '' which banks would use to spotlight questionable payments .
But banks may prefer using a profile that targets selected transactions , rather than a blanket reporting requirement .
Banks now are required only to report cash deposits or withdrawals of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000</ENAMEX> or more .
But wire transfers from a standing account -- including those bigger than $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000</ENAMEX> -- are n't reported .
Officials believe this has left a gaping loophole that illegal drug businesses are exploiting .
Authorities estimate that revenues from illegal drugs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> total <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 110 billion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</ENAMEX> .
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kerry</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , chairman of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate Foreign Relations</ENAMEX> subcommittee that oversees the issue of money laundering , criticized the proposal for ignoring wire transfers between foreign banks that are executed and cleared on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> wire systems .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The American Bankers Association</ENAMEX> did n't have any comment on the plan .
The proposal now enters a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">60 - day</ENAMEX> comment period , after which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> will propose final regulations , followed by another comment period .
