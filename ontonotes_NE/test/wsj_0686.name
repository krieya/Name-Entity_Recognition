<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> sent to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.5 billion</ENAMEX> military construction bill that cuts spending for new installations by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</ENAMEX> while revamping the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> budget to move <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 450 million</ENAMEX> from foreign bases to home - state projects .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> measure builds on a pattern set <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> defense authorizing committees , and -- at a time of retrenchment for the military and concern about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's standing in the world economy -- overseas spending is most vulnerable .
Total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> requests for installations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United Kingdom</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> , for example , are cut by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost two - thirds</ENAMEX> , while lawmakers added to the military budget for construction in all but a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozen</ENAMEX> states at home .
The result is that instead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> 's proposed split of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 - 40</ENAMEX> between domestic and foreign bases , the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 - 30</ENAMEX> .
The extra margin for bases in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> enhances the power of the appropriations committees ; meanwhile , lawmakers used their positions to garner as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> times what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> had requested for their individual states .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Whitten</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miss .</ENAMEX> -RRB- helped secure <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 49.7 million</ENAMEX> for his state , or more than double the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> 's budget .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> , home of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Byrd</ENAMEX> , would receive <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21.5 million</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> times the military 's request .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> , home states of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> chairmen of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> military construction subcommittees , receive <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 243.2 million</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</ENAMEX> above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> 's request .
Though spending for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> was far less , their increases above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> requests -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">640 %</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">430 %</ENAMEX> , respectively -- were much greater because of the influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> at critical junctures .
The swift passage of the bill , which cleared the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> on simple voice votes <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> , contrasts with the problems still facing a more cumbersome <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 66.8 billion</ENAMEX> measure funding housing , environmental , space and veterans programs .
By an <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84 - 6</ENAMEX> margin , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> approved the bulk of the spending <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , but the bill was then sent back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit allocations for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Housing Administration</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> leadership could seek to waive these restrictions , but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere .
Appropriations committees have used an assortment of devices to disguise <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 1 billion</ENAMEX> in spending , and as critics have awakened to these devices , the bill can seem like a wounded caribou trying to make it past ice and wolves to reach safer <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</ENAMEX> grazing .
Much of the excess spending will be pushed into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1991</ENAMEX> , and in some cases is temporarily parked in slow - spending accounts in anticipation of being transferred to faster - spending areas after the budget scorekeeping is completed .
For example , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - Senate conference ostensibly increased the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX> budget for construction of facilities to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 592 million</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 200 million</ENAMEX> above what either chamber had previously approved .
Part of the increase would provide <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 90 million</ENAMEX> toward ensuring construction of a costly solid rocket - motor facility in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitten</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> .
But as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 177 million</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 30 %</ENAMEX> of the account , is marked for potential transfers to research , management and flight accounts that are spent out at a faster clip .
The bill 's managers face criticism , too , for the unusual number of conditions openly imposed on where funds will be spent .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Conservatives</ENAMEX> , embarrassed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> influence - peddling scandals at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> , have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> - controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">HUD</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> backed an unsuccessful effort to strike such language <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> , but received little support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> budget office , which wants to protect space - station funding in the bill and has tended to turn its eyes from pork - barrel amendments .
Within discretionary funds for community development grants , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 3.7 million</ENAMEX> is allocated to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> , home state of a subcommittee chairman , Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Traxler</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Foley</ENAMEX> won $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">510,000</ENAMEX> for a project in his district in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> state , and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 million</ENAMEX> , earmarked by Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Inouye</ENAMEX> , amounts to a business subsidy under the title `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hawaiian</ENAMEX> sugar mills job retention . ''
The powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> had first wanted to add language relaxing environmental restrictions on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> mills on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Hamakua coast</ENAMEX> that are threatening to close .
When this plan met resistance , it was agreed instead to take money from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">HUD</ENAMEX> to subsidize needed improvements in two settling ponds for the mills , which employ <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 1,500</ENAMEX> workers , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inouye</ENAMEX> 's office .
