HOPES OF SIMPLIFYING the corporate minimum tax before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> are weakening .
The method of calculating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</ENAMEX> tax , paid if it exceeds tax figured the regular way , is due for a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> , thanks to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> 's tax act .
But most experts agree that the concept that is to be introduced drags in great complexity ; they have been trying to head it off <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ways and Means</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> backed a simplification plan in the pending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> tax bill , but the plan turns out to be a big revenue loser .
Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> 's stripped - down bill omits any proposal to deal with the corporate tax .
Proponents of simplification fear that the chances of getting it into the final bill are waning .
`` We hear it has low priority on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> side , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Starr</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coopers -AMP- Lybrand</ENAMEX> , CPAs .
If the law is n't changed , he says , `` we are left staring at rules that are almost impossible to implement , because there are so many complex depreciation calculations to do . ''
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> still could resolve the issue with other legislation <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> or next , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> adds .
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HUGO</ENAMEX> 'S RAVAGES may be offset by immediate claims for tax refunds .
This law aids hurricane - wracked locales named by the president as disaster areas , as well as regions so designated after other <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> disasters .
It lets victims elect to deduct casualty losses on either <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> or amended <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> returns , whichever offers the larger tax benefit ; they have until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 16</ENAMEX> to choose .
Amending a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> return to claim a refund brings cash faster ; but for personal losses , there are other factors to consider , notes publisher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prentice Hall</ENAMEX> .
A loss -- after insurance recoveries -- is deductible only to the extent that it exceeds $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">100</ENAMEX> and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> 's total losses exceed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> of adjusted gross income ; victims may pick <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</ENAMEX> when income is lower and deductions higher .
In filing an original -LRB- not amended -RRB- return , a couple should consider whether damaged property is owned jointly or separately and whether <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> spouse has larger income ; that may determine whether they should file jointly or separately .
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> DELAYS several deadlines for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX> 's victims .
Returns for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> from people with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> filing extensions were due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> says people in the disaster areas wo n't be penalized for late filing if their returns are marked `` <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX> '' and postmarked by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 16</ENAMEX> .
Interest will be imposed on unpaid taxes , but late - payment penalties on the returns will be waived if the balance due and paid is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> or less of the liability .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IRS Notice 89 - 136</ENAMEX> describes this and other deadline relief for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX> 's victims .
Among the provisions : <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Fiscal - year</ENAMEX> taxpayers with returns due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Monday</ENAMEX> wo n't be penalized if they file -- or request an extension -- and pay tax due by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 15</ENAMEX> .
Excise - tax returns due by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 31</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 30</ENAMEX> may be delayed to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 16</ENAMEX> .
Extensions ca n't be granted for filing employment - tax returns due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 31</ENAMEX> or for depositing withheld taxes , but late penalties will be abated for deposits made by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 15</ENAMEX> .
The notice also grants relief for certain estate - tax returns .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ONE - DAY</ENAMEX> JAUNTS in a chartered boat were perks for permanent staffers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Business Service Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Mesa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , supplier of temporary workers .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> denied cost deductions because few of the temps got to go aboard .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Tax Court</ENAMEX> said the limitations were reasonable and realistic and allowed the deductions .
USED - CAR BUYERS who try to avoid sales tax by understating prices paid in private deals are the targets of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> drive .
Estimating that the state may lose <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</ENAMEX> a year , officials announced the filing of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> criminal actions and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> '' of civil penalties .
WHEN AN IRA OWNER dies , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">trustee</ENAMEX> of the individual retirement account must file forms <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5498</ENAMEX> reporting market values relating to the decedent and each beneficiary , with copies to the executor and beneficiaries .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> Revenue Procedure <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</ENAMEX> - 52 describes the reporting requirements .
BIGGER THAN A BREADBOX was this cash hoarder 's reputation for honesty .
People often cite frugality and distrust of banks to justify cash caches to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory Damonne Brown</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fremont</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , a hardworking , reclusive young bachelor , told that story to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Tax Court</ENAMEX> .
But judges usually find the real aim is to escape tax on hidden income ; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> must have had such income -- although it uncovered no source -- because he deposited $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">124,732</ENAMEX> in a bank account in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982 - 84</ENAMEX> while reporting income of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 52,012</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> 's story :
The deposits came from savings kept in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tupperware</ENAMEX> breadbox ; he saved $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">47,000</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1974 - 81</ENAMEX> by living with family members and pinching pennies and $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">45,000</ENAMEX> of secret gifts from his remorseful father , who had abandoned the family in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> had no proof ; but testimony of his mother and stepmother about his father and of an ex-employer about his honesty and habits satisfied a judge that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> was truthful and his tale of gifts was possible .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> offered no evidence of hidden sources of taxable income , so Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shields</ENAMEX> rejected its claims .
BRIEFS :
Asked how he made charitable gifts of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">26,350</ENAMEX> out of reported <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> income of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">46,892</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas H. McFall</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bryan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> , told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Tax Court</ENAMEX> he had understated his income .
The court rejected his incredible claims , denied his deductions , and imposed a negligence penalty ... .
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schaefer</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colo.</ENAMEX> -RRB- entered a bill to exempt from tax rewards for tips leading to the arrest of violent criminals .
