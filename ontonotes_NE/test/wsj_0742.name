As program trading comes under renewed attack for causing stock market gyrations , a few people on Wall Street say it is time to consider extreme measures .
The real answer to curbing wild swings in stock prices , they say , might be to curb or even abolish stock - index futures .
A stock - index future is a contract to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks , such as the Standard -AMP- Poor 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> - stock index .
Since stock futures were created in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> , trading on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> and other exchanges has boomed to the point where trading in stock - index futures rivals that in the stocks themselves .
The conventional view , as voiced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Goldman , Sachs -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> partner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fischer Black</ENAMEX> , is that stocks and `` derivatives '' such as futures and options `` form a single market , and that derivatives make it a more liquid market . ''
But increasingly , people are questioning that view , and the critics include some of the country 's most successful investors .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Buffett</ENAMEX> has been on record as opposing stock - index futures since their inception in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Gabelli</ENAMEX> , another star in the investing world , says , `` My gut says the negatives of futures and synthetics far outweigh the benefits . ''
Like others , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabelli</ENAMEX> says that if futures cause investors to lose confidence in stocks , they will move away from stocks -- as many have already done .
And those who remain , he says `` will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of capital to companies . ''
Essentially , the critics of stock - index futures fall into <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> camps .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility ; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market 's basic function of raising capital .
`` Before futures , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Harkins</ENAMEX> , `` you actually had to pay attention to whether the thing you were buying had any intrinsic value . ''
While it was once expected that futures would mimic stock prices , traders now routinely check the futures markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> before they buy or sell stocks .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> futures prices jump up or down , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> follows .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> , for instance , the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</ENAMEX> points in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">little more than an hour</ENAMEX> .
Then , in the space of a <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">20 - minute</ENAMEX> coffee break , the average rallied almost all of the way back .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Lesutis</ENAMEX> , who manages <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 3 billion</ENAMEX> of investments at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Provident Capital Management Inc.</ENAMEX> , blames futures markets for leading the way .
`` The fundamentals do n't change in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
`` I think they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing . ''
Index arbitrage -- the rapid - fire buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in futures -- is frequently blamed for adding to stock market volatility .
Although index arbitrage is said to add liquidity to markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bachmann</ENAMEX> , managing partner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Edward D. Jones</ENAMEX> , says too much liquidity is n't a good thing
`` The kind of instant liquidity that is implied by index futures is that you can buy a portfolio over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> and get out in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</ENAMEX> .
It 's too disruptive , '' he says .
`` It is n't investing . ''
But stock - index futures have plenty of support .
Defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks .
They note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures .
And , defenders say , few people complain about futures when stock prices are rising .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Margolis</ENAMEX> , managing director in charge of equity options and futures at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX> , says that trading baskets of stocks began in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</ENAMEX> before the advent of futures .
Futures , he says , merely cut down on trading costs .
He says `` blaming futures is like blaming the messenger . ''
Since stock - index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the futures and stock markets , it ca n't add to volatility , he says .
Futures `` do n't need defending , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Yemma</ENAMEX> , a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> , which trades the S-AMP-P 500 , by far the largest stock - index futures contract .
Despite the current outcry over stock market volatility , few people expect stock futures to disappear .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> futures exchanges have political and financial clout -- including many friends in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> .
And traders say that futures have become an accepted part of the financial landscape .
`` All life is about change -- either you adapt or die , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> futures trader .
`` If futures are n't permitted here , we 'll take it to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> . ''
Average <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> volume in S-AMP-P 500 futures <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44,877</ENAMEX> contracts .
Based on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's closing price of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">S-AMP-P</ENAMEX> , the average value of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one day 's</ENAMEX> trading amounts to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.6 billion</ENAMEX> .
By contrast , average dollar volume on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.3 billion</ENAMEX> .
Many investment managers say futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios .
If managers fear that the overall stock market will fall , but want to continue owning stocks , they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts .

And although criticism of futures generally comes from Wall Street , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> futures trader notes that brokerage firms rely on futures as hedging tools when they buy and sell big blocks of stocks from institutions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> reason futures are said to add volatility is that -- unlike in stocks -- people can speculate in futures with little money down .
Margin requirements for speculators on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> are currently <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 7 %</ENAMEX> .
`` For <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</ENAMEX> , you can move <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</ENAMEX> of stocks , '' a specialist on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> gripes .
`` That gives futures traders a lot more power . ''
By contrast , an investor in stocks must put up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> in cash .
Some critics say futures encourage people to think of stocks as a single commodity , rather than as investments in individual businesses .
Thus , they say , futures inhibit the basic purpose of the stock market : to accurately price securities so that capital and investment flows where it 's needed most .
The S-AMP-P <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> index futures `` transferred the identity of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> stocks into <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> unit - making them a simple commodity to trade , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Kegler</ENAMEX> , senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">A. Webster Dougherty</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> .
`` It took away the need to know the bad <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">third - quarter</ENAMEX> report of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> , for example , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kegler</ENAMEX> says .
Of course , portfolio trading -- the increasingly common practice of buying or selling baskets of actual stocks -- also treats stocks as homogenous commodities .
`` There is a class of investor that wants to be exposed '' to the whole market , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandip Bhagat</ENAMEX> , assistant vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Travelers Investment Management Co</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">S-AMP-P</ENAMEX> futures are merely a `` cheaper and quicker '' way to get access to all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> stocks , he says .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> began trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the S-AMP-P <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> stocks .
But owning index futures is n't the same as owning the underlying stocks .
Stockholders , as a group , can win , because they own a share of corporate earnings , which can grow and boost stock prices .
Futures , on the other hand , are a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</ENAMEX> sum game -- a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices .
`` You do n't own anything , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Boesel</ENAMEX> , a money manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">T. Rowe Price</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> .
`` You 're making a pure bet on the market .
