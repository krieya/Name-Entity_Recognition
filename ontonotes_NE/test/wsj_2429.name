<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</ENAMEX> - point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987 October</ENAMEX> crash , and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly .
Still , the lesson is about the same : On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday the 13th</ENAMEX> , the market was spooked by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL</ENAMEX> takeover , and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL</ENAMEX> trading halt .
Still , the consensus seems almost as wide that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> business .
This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> ticker shortly before the downturn : the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> in stalling the capital gains tax cut .
The real value of all shares , after all , is directly impacted by the tax on any profits -LRB- all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' -RRB- .
And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">An hour</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.4 billion</ENAMEX> in tax increases without a capital gains cut .
There is a great deal to be said , to be sure , for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill .
It would be a good thing if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> started to decide issues one - by - <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> on their individual merits without trickery .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing , no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an up - or - down vote .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> leaders have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens , promises of a cleaner bill are suspect .
Especially so since President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has been weakened by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> fiasco .
To the extent that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL</ENAMEX> troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> 's sticky fingers .
As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course , at some point the market will start to reject them .
But the airlines are scarcely a clear case , given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Transportation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> , who professes to believe safety will be compromised if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KLM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">British Airways</ENAMEX> own interests in companies that fly airplanes .
Worse , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> has started to jump on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> bandwagon .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Oberstar</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> who chairs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Public Works and Transportation Committee 's</ENAMEX> aviation subcommittee , has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Air Lines</ENAMEX> bids .
It would give Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 50 days</ENAMEX> to `` review '' any bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</ENAMEX> or more of the voting stock of any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> carrier with revenues of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> or more .
So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL</ENAMEX> deal has problems , and the market loses <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</ENAMEX> points .
Congratulations , Mr. Secretary and Mr. Congressman .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash , remember , the market was shaken by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> proposal to tax takeovers out of existance .
Even more important , in our view , was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's threat to thrash the dollar .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> is doing the same thing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> ; thankfully , the dollar is not under <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> - style pressure .
Also , traders are in better shape <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> to survive selling binges .
They are better capitalized .
They are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape lags and clearing and settlement delays .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> promises any needed liquidity .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Big Board 's</ENAMEX> liaison with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> has improved ; it will be interesting to learn if `` circuit breakers '' prove to be a good idea .
In any event , some traders see stocks as underpriced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> .
There is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be cured by a little coherence and common sense in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
But on the bearish side , that may be too much to expect .
