-LRB- During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">its centennial year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past century</ENAMEX> that stand as milestones of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> business history . -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">THE YOM KIPPUR WAR</ENAMEX> , WHEN <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">EGYPT</ENAMEX> CRASHED into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 6 , 1973</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the holiest day</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> calendar , lasted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">barely a month</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> far - afield effect is still with us .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> states , always bitterly resentful of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> support toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> , realized they held an irresistable weapon -- oil .
Early in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> nations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> jacked up prices sharply .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 22</ENAMEX> , led by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> , the world 's largest exporter , they embargoed oil shipments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's staunchest <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> ally .
The timing was perfect .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> had tried embargos before .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> to seize the Suez Canal , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> producers cut off supplies to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> simply pumped harder .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> oil supplies , however , had peaked in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</ENAMEX> and by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</ENAMEX> were declining .
Imports , then <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six million barrels</ENAMEX> a day , came primarily from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> supplies were growing in importance .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> was bringing in <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two million barrels</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> oil a day , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the 17.3 million barrels</ENAMEX> consumed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> .
Politics and economics conspired .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , far more dependent on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mideast</ENAMEX> oil than the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , would n't offend the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> or trade off their precious supplies .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> did manage to supply the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Dutch</ENAMEX> with oil by relabeling supplies ; once oil is shipped , no one can tell its source .
But car - happy <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> panicked , and so did the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and other oil - consuming governments .
`` Shortage '' and `` crisis '' became buzz words , although neither really applied .
The spot dislocations that showed up were largely the result of confusion -LRB- much of it in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> -RRB- , though that was cold comfort for drivers waiting in <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mile</ENAMEX> - long lines at the gas pumps .
The embargo lasted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only six months</ENAMEX> , but the price hikes became a fact of life .
What the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> started , inflation finished .
Once and for all , $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5</ENAMEX> - a - barrel crude oil and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">35 - cents</ENAMEX> - a - gallon gasoline were history .
