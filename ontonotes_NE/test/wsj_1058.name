Place a phone order through most any catalog and chances are the clerk who answers wo n't be the only one on the line .
Bosses have big ears <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> .
Or open up an electronics magazine and peruse the ads for sneaky tape recorders and other snooping gadgets .
Some would make even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bond</ENAMEX> green with envy .
Eavesdropping -- both corporate and private -- is on the rise , thanks to the proliferation of surveillance technologies .
And while sellers of the equipment and companies `` monitoring '' employees have few qualms , right - to - privacy advocates and some lawmakers are alarmed .
`` New technologies are changing the way we deal with each other and the way we work , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janlori Goldman</ENAMEX> , a staff attorney at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the American Civil Liberties Union</ENAMEX> .
`` Our expectation of confidentiality is being eroded . ''
On the corporate side , companies claim that monitoring employee phone conversations is both legal and necessary to gauge productivity and ensure good service .
The practice is common at catalog , insurance and phone companies , banks and telemarketers , according to trade groups and worker organizations .
It 's also widespread for reservations clerks in the airline , car - rental , hotel and railroad industries .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Communications Workers of America</ENAMEX> , which opposes such monitoring , says supervisors listen in on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 400 million</ENAMEX> calls <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</ENAMEX> .
Among companies saying they monitor employees are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Airlines</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Airlines</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Parcel Service</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nynex Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Spiegel Inc.</ENAMEX> , and the circulation department of this newspaper .
Some Wall Street firms monitor for recordkeeping purposes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dictaphone Corp.</ENAMEX> says there 's a big business demand for its voice - activated taping systems , whether the sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Veritrac 9000</ENAMEX> system , which costs from $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">120,000</ENAMEX> and can record <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</ENAMEX> conversations simultaneously , or simple handheld units selling for $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">395</ENAMEX> .
Businesses `` want to verify information and ensure accuracy , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hiltunen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dictaphone</ENAMEX> 's manager of media relations .
The state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> recently bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Veritrac</ENAMEX> system , he says , `` to monitor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Exxon</ENAMEX> cleanup effort . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> say they use voice - activated systems to record and verify orders between salesmen and traders .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson</ENAMEX> says it has taped some of its institutional trading desks , such as commodities and futures , for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about four years</ENAMEX> .
Both companies stress that employees know they are being recorded and that customer conversations are n't taped .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder Peabody -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> says it monitors bond - trading conversations between brokers and customers to safeguard order accuracy .
Eavesdropping by individuals is harder to measure .
But devices are there for the asking , whether in stores or through the mail .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Counter Spy Shop</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> , for instance , offers the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">`` Secret Connection ''</ENAMEX> attache case , which can surreptitiously record conversations for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nine hours</ENAMEX> at a stretch .
That and other fancy gizmos may cost <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> , but simple voice - activated tape recorders sell for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little as $ 70</ENAMEX> at electronics stores like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Shack</ENAMEX> .
The most common use of spying devices is in divorce cases , say private investigators .
While tape recordings to uncover , say , infidelity are n't admissible in court , they can mean leverage in a settlement .
Concerned with the increased availability of surveillance technology and heavier use of it , lawmakers have proposed laws addressing the issue .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</ENAMEX> states have introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made aware of monitoring .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> states -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> -- have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> bills in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> hope to make such restrictions national .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May</ENAMEX> , Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Edwards</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif .</ENAMEX> -RRB- introduced congressional legislation that would require an audible beeping during any employee monitoring , warning people that they are being heard .
-LRB- The legislation is similar to a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> `` beeper bill '' that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry . -RRB-
Also <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last spring</ENAMEX> , Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Dellums</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , introduced a bill requiring universal <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - party consent to any tapings in cases that do n't involve law enforcement .
In addition , products such as voice - activated tape recorders would have to include beep tones and labels explaining federal laws on eavesdropping .
The outlook on both federal bills is uncertain , especially remembering the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> defeat .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ACLU</ENAMEX> and worker organizations back tighter laws , but employers and device manufacturers object .
`` I 'm sympathetic with workers who feel under the gun , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Barton</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Direct Marketing Association of America</ENAMEX> , which is lobbying strenuously against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwards</ENAMEX> beeper bill .
`` But the only way you can find out how your people are doing is by listening . ''
The powerful group , which represents many of the nation 's telemarketers , was instrumental in derailing the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> bill .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spiegel</ENAMEX> also opposes the beeper bill , saying the noise it requires would interfere with customer orders , causing irritation and even errors .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Dale</ENAMEX> , center manager at the catalog company 's customer order center in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reno</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nev.</ENAMEX> , defends monitoring .
`` We like to follow up and make sure operators are achieving our standards of company service , '' says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale</ENAMEX> , who supervises <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</ENAMEX> operators .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bonomo</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nynex</ENAMEX> spokesman , says the telephone company needs to monitor operators to evaluate performance during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first six months</ENAMEX> on the job .
`` Sometimes , '' he says , `` we 'll pull someone off the phones for more training . ''
Federal wiretap statutes recognize the right of employers to monitor employees ' for evaluation purposes .
And in the past , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> has viewed monitoring as an issue best handled in union negotiations .
But opponents , led by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CWA</ENAMEX> , say new laws are needed because monitoring is heavily concentrated in service industries and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81 %</ENAMEX> of monitored workers are n't represented by unions .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CWA</ENAMEX> claims that monitoring not only infringes on employee privacy , but increases stress .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nine to Five</ENAMEX> , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> - based office workers organization that supports the beeper bill , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six months ago</ENAMEX> started a privacy hot line to receive reports of alleged monitoring abuses .
Meanwhile , supporters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dellums</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - party consent bill say it is needed because of a giant loophole in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - party consent law .
Currently , if the person taping is a party to the conversation , it 's all right to record without the knowledge of the other person on the line .
-LRB- Intercepting other people 's private conversations is illegal and punishable by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> in prison and fines of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
The electronics industry is closely following the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dellums</ENAMEX> bill .
Some marketers of surveillance gear -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Communication Control System Ltd.</ENAMEX> , which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Counter Spy Shop</ENAMEX> and others like it -- already put warning labels in their catalogs informing customers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - party law .
But vendors contend that they ca n't control how their products are used .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Shack</ENAMEX> says it has a policy against selling products if a salesperson suspects they will be used illegally .
`` Everything sold at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Shack</ENAMEX> has a legal purpose , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Appel</ENAMEX> , president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tandy Corp.</ENAMEX> subsidiary .
He says he has n't yet studied the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dellums</ENAMEX> bill , but that requiring a beeping tone on recorders `` would be ludicrous . ''
Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio Shack</ENAMEX> is aware that some of its products are controversial .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years ago</ENAMEX> , the company voluntarily stopped selling `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">The Big Ear</ENAMEX> , '' a powerful microphone .
With its ability to pick up rustlings and flapping wings , `` it was meant to be a toy for children for bird watching , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appel</ENAMEX> .
`` But we were getting too many complaints that people were using them to eavesdrop on their neighbors . ''
