It has been almost ten years from the first time I got to know about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inter Milan</ENAMEX> from the newspaper , and then later I grew to like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inter Milan</ENAMEX> and to the time when I fell deeply in love with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inter Milan</ENAMEX> .
Actually , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inter Milan</ENAMEX> has n't achieved overly spectacular results in the last <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ten</ENAMEX> years .
Except a few prizes of little interest like <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">a UEFA Cup</ENAMEX> , a few divisional cups and a few <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super Cups</ENAMEX> , it has never <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">once</ENAMEX> gotten a hand on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">a Champions Cup</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">a UEFA Champions League Cup</ENAMEX> .
These achievements simply are n't worth mentioning when compared with those of powerhouses such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manchester United</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Real Madrid</ENAMEX> .
Even within Italy , their records are quite far behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Juventus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AC</ENAMEX> .
Then why do I still like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inter Milan</ENAMEX> ?
Why is there only the blue and blacks in my heart ?
When I <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> came into contact with football , I appreciated it with a mindset of commiseration with the underdog .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inter Milan</ENAMEX> 's just a step away from the championship for years and its long humiliation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Juventus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AC</ENAMEX> stirred a sense of sympathy in me ;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</ENAMEX> , I found <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inter Milan 's</ENAMEX> blue and black jerseys look very comfortable to me visually .
Gradually , I was moved by the persistence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inter Milan 's</ENAMEX> chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr. Moratti</ENAMEX> .
Although the payoff has been small after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</ENAMEX> of persistent investment , that does n't change his absolute sincerity toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inter Milan</ENAMEX> .
As a result , I started to pay more attention to this soccer team
