<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Justice Department</ENAMEX> scrambled to play down the significance of its new guidelines concerning prosecutions under the federal racketeering law .
The guidelines were distributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorneys <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</ENAMEX> but were disclosed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time by press reports <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> .
They discourage prosecutors , under certain circumstances , from seeking court orders seizing the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Runkel</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justice Department</ENAMEX> spokesman , said the guidelines `` are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction . ''
Use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations</ENAMEX> law against white - collar defendants , as opposed to alleged organized - crime figures , has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars .
Critics have complained that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains .
In the new guidelines , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial , `` the government will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant '' and `` will not seek ... to take from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> parties assets legitimately transferred to them . ''
The guidelines also state , `` The government 's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime . ''
Another provision clarifies certain limits on when prosecutors may use tax - fraud charges as a basis for bringing a racketeering case .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Runkel</ENAMEX> declined to speculate on whether the guidelines would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants .
`` The impact , if there is any , will be impossible to judge ahead of time because the decision whether to use -LCB- racketeering charges -RCB- is made in individual cases '' by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justice Department</ENAMEX> officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , he said .
In a memorandum describing the guidelines , Assistant Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Dennis Jr.</ENAMEX> said that government efforts to freeze defendants ' assets pending racketeering prosecutions `` have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press . ''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Runkel</ENAMEX> said the government is n't `` backing off on these kinds of matters at all .
