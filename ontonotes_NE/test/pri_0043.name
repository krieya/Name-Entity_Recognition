There was a rowdy session of parliament that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Barak</ENAMEX> addressed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> lawmakers had assembled since the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> uprising began <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a month ago</ENAMEX> .
Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> told the legislature that he believes peace in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> is still possible , but that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> does not have a partner prepared to make compromises .
A spirit of compromise was also hard to find in the parliament , as The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">World</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katy Clark</ENAMEX> reports .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Barak 's</ENAMEX> optimism that peace can still be achieved comes as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> Prime Minister struggles to keep his left center party in office .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> has been working without a parliamentary majority since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> when right wing and religious parties deserted his coalition government in protest over the way he was handling peace negotiations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> largest party , the ultra-orthodox <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shaff</ENAMEX> agreed to support <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> for the time being , but while that seems to have won the beleaguered Prime Minister a reprieve , it did n't stop other right wing legislators from shouting down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> 's address to parliament <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> Prime Minister also had to contend with furious <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> legislators .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , I have no confidence in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> .
Law maker Acnit T.b .
We presented already a non-confidence motion , my party <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Arab Movement for Change</ENAMEX> and it will be discussed during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next week</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> had hoped to open <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's session by announcing the formation of a national emergency unity government with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ariel Sharon 's</ENAMEX> opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Likud Party</ENAMEX> , but negotiations <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this past weekend</ENAMEX> to form such a coalition were inconclusive .
That 's just as well according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shible Tel Hamie</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Brooklyn Institution</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tel Hamie</ENAMEX> acknowledges that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> had succeeded in getting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon</ENAMEX> to join up in a new government , the Prime Minister would have a majority in parliament , but he would also be in a bind internationally because with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sharon</ENAMEX> , who did not have a nice image internationally , who went alone in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> , and clearly , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> would be less likely to cooperate with that government , so he faces a major tension between his peace agenda and his domestic agenda .
As if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> needed any reminding of that , the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> negotiator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saeb Eraket</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> criticized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> for tailoring his speech to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> right wing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arakat</ENAMEX> predicted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> 's latest political maneuvering would have a negative effect on the peace process .
