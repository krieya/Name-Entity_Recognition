<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> banned all imports of mushrooms from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> in response to a rash of food - poisoning outbreaks linked to canned <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> mushrooms .
`` The agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom - processing industry in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , '' an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FDA</ENAMEX> spokesman said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
The agency wo n't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> plant to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> until `` satisfactory sanitation - control measures are implemented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> to prevent '' bacterial contamination .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May 19</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FDA</ENAMEX> began detaining <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> mushrooms in <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">68 - ounce</ENAMEX> cans after <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</ENAMEX> people in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> became ill from eating tainted mushrooms .
In subsequent tests , the agency found smaller - size cans from several <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> plants to be similarly contaminated .
The outbreaks were traced to staphylococcus aureus , a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning vegetables .
A recall of the mushrooms blamed for the food poisoning began in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early March</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> exported <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">65 million pounds</ENAMEX> of mushrooms , valued at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 47 million</ENAMEX> , to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
The shipments went mostly to food - service distributors that supply pizzerias and restaurants .
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chinese Embassy</ENAMEX> here said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> government has taken `` many effective measures '' to stop the mushroom contamination and is further investigating the underlying causes .
He predicted the problem will be solved `` very soon . ''
