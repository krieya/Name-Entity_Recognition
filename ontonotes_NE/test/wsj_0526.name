Like so many trends in the entertainment industry , the current spate of rape dramas on television seems to represent a confluence of high - mindedness and self - interest .
The former comes from the latest wave of political activism in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> , especially around feminist issues such as abortion .
The latter comes from the perception , on the part of many people in network TV , that their only hope of keeping viewers from defecting to cable is to fill the airwaves with an increasingly raw sensationalism .
Put these together , and you get programs about rape .
The best of the crop was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week 's</ENAMEX> season premiere of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In the Heat of the Night</ENAMEX> , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> series based on a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</ENAMEX> feature film about a black <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> police detective in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Southern</ENAMEX> town .
In the series , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virgil Tibbs</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Rollins</ENAMEX> -RRB- and his wife , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Althea</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne - Marie Johnson</ENAMEX> -RRB- have settled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sparta</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miss</ENAMEX> .
Because the show has acquired a sense of place by being filmed on location in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> , this episode -- in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Althea</ENAMEX> gets raped by an arrogant white schoolteacher -- does a decent job of tracing the social repercussions of the crime .
Obviously , it 's harder to establish a sense of place in a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - shot TV movie .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> 's offering , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Settle the Score</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">9 - 11 p.m. EST</ENAMEX> , on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> -RRB- , does n't even try .
This tale of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> policewoman returning home to find the man who raped her <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years earlier</ENAMEX> is supposed to be set in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Ozarks</ENAMEX> .
But it 's more like an illustration of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Stein</ENAMEX> describes in his study of social attitudes in the TV industry : `` Fear of violence and animosity ... because of race or religion , fear and lack of comprehension about the politics of small - town people ... produce a powerful wave of dislike of small towns in the minds of TV writers and producers . ''
The writer and executive producer of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Settle the Score</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Sohmer</ENAMEX> , is a graduate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yale</ENAMEX> who participated in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PBS</ENAMEX> documentary , aired <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</ENAMEX> , in which <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yale</ENAMEX> class of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</ENAMEX> ruminated about their lives since graduation .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> point in the documentary , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sohmer</ENAMEX> , who is <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> , says he felt rejected by many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Protestants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Southerners</ENAMEX> he met at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yale</ENAMEX> .
He quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> student saying , `` You 're just the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewboy</ENAMEX> we <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Southerners</ENAMEX> ca n't stand .
'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sohmer</ENAMEX> confesses that it was partly in response to such attitudes that he is now `` a dweller on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> islands off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> . ''
But is exile in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> enough ?
Not to judge by `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Settle the Score</ENAMEX> , '' in which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sohmer</ENAMEX> seems to be settling a score of his own .
Of all the unflattering portraits of small - town <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> I 've seen on TV , this film is the most gratuitously nasty .
The sole sympathetic character is the prodigal daughter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaclyn Smith</ENAMEX> -RRB- , and she is tolerable only by virtue of having nothing in common with her kinfolk , a truly benighted pack of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Southern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Protestants</ENAMEX> whose grim existence consists mostly of growing peaches and repressing sex .
I mean , these folks are so uptight that they blame pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> for the fact that when she was a teen - ager , someone tied her hands behind her back , thrust her head into a gunny sack , brutally raped and beat her , and then left her to die in a cold - storage room .
Her Pa -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Duff</ENAMEX> -RRB- is the kind of guy who , while saying grace at the supper table , pauses at the word `` sin '' and glares at the daughter he has n't seen for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades</ENAMEX> , because he knows in his heart that she enjoyed what happened in the cold - storage room , and has been indulging the same taste ever since in the fleshpots of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
People like Pa do exist , of course .
But in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sohmer</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Ozarks</ENAMEX> , he is but the tip of the patriarchal iceberg .
Every man <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> encounters is either sniggeringly puritanical , viciously patronizing , revoltingly lecherous , or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</ENAMEX> .
Add the fact that any <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of them , including Pa , could be her attacker , and you have a setting that does n't resemble small - town <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , or even <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> 's nightmare of small - town <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , so much as a paranoid feminist dystopia like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Atwood 's</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Handmaid 's Tale</ENAMEX> , '' itself soon to be -LRB- you guessed it -RRB- a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> movie .
There are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> exceptions : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josh</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey DeMunn</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the local doctor who has always loved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lincoln</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Masur</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> 's simple - minded but affectionate brother .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josh</ENAMEX> makes clumsy passes at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> when she 's seething with anger and fear , but we know from the outset that he 's not a member of the evil patriarchy .
How could he be ?
He 's the director of the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Planned Parenthood</ENAMEX> chapter .
As for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lincoln</ENAMEX> , if you ca n't guess why he 's so sweet to his sister when everybody else hates her , then I 'm not going to tell you .
As for the women , they 're pathetic .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> 's Ma -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louise Latham</ENAMEX> -RRB- is a moral coward .
Her sister - in - law -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy Wright</ENAMEX> -RRB- is a sniveling prude afraid that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> will seduce all the married men in town , including a particularly loathsome fellow named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tucker</ENAMEX> , whose idea of fun is to leave his wife at home tending to her bruises and cigarette burns , while he bullies <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> into a dance that consists of drooling on her while trying to break her ribs .
At the very least , it would appear that Sis is a poor judge of masculine charm .
Yet even these insulting caricatures are not as bad as the moral hypocrisy at the heart of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Settle the Score</ENAMEX> . ''
In the aforementioned episode of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In the Heat of the Night</ENAMEX> , '' we saw <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Althea</ENAMEX> being attacked , but we were n't invited to enjoy the spectacle .
In Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sohmer</ENAMEX> 's film , by contrast , we are urged to share the perverse excitement of the rapist creeping up on his victim , as the camera ogles <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> in various stages of undress and lingers on the sight of her trussed - up body during frequent flashbacks to the rape .
At this point , the truce between feminism and sensationalism gets mighty uneasy .
Take the scene in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> stands naked by a lighted window , whispering to her hidden assailant , `` Look all you want .
Starting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> , I 'm stalking you .
'' Or the one in which she and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josh</ENAMEX> are stranded in the city , and , after insisting on separate motel rooms , she knocks on his door to pour out her feelings about the rape -- wearing nothing but a mini-slip and a push - up bra .
Surely the question is obvious .
With friends like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sohmer</ENAMEX> , do the feminists of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> need enemies ?
