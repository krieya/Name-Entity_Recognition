<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fujitsu Ltd. 's</ENAMEX> top executive took the unusual step of publicly apologizing for his company 's making bids of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">just one yen</ENAMEX> for several local government projects , while computer rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NEC Corp.</ENAMEX> made a written apology for indulging in the same practice .
Meanwhile , business and government leaders rebuked the computer makers , and fretted about the broader statement the companies ' actions make about <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> cutthroat pricing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> said it bid the equivalent of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than a U.S. penny</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> separate municipal contracts during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</ENAMEX> .
The company also disclosed that during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that period</ENAMEX> it offered <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000 yen</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 70</ENAMEX> , for another contract .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">No. 1</ENAMEX> computer maker , is n't alone .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NEC</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of its largest domestic competitors , said it bid <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">one yen</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> separate public auctions since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> .
In both cases , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NEC</ENAMEX> lost the contract to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> , which made the same bid and won a tie - breaking lottery .
All the contracts were for computer - system - design contracts and involved no hardware or software .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Ministry of International Trade and Industry</ENAMEX> summoned executives from the companies to `` make sure they understood '' the concern about such practices , according to a government spokesman .
`` These cases lead to the loss of the firms ' social and international credibility , '' a ministry statement said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fair Trade Commission</ENAMEX> has said it is considering investigating the bids for possible antitrust - law violations .
`` We would like to apologize for having caused huge trouble , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takuma Yamamoto</ENAMEX> , read from a prepared statement as he stood before a packed news conference at his company 's downtown headquarters .
The bids , he added , were `` contrary to common sense . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NEC</ENAMEX> released a statement saying , `` We feel sorry for having caused trouble to society , '' a form of apology common in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> for companies caught in embarrassing situations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> companies have long had a reputation for sacrificing short - term profits to make a sale that may have long - term benefits .
But the growing controversy comes as many practices historically accepted as normal here -- such as politicians accepting substantial gifts from businessmen or having extramarital affairs -- are coming under close ethical scrutiny .
The fire is also fueled by growing international interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> behavior .
So far there have been no public overseas complaints about the issue .
But in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the auctions in question , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> made a bid substantially higher than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> offer , according to the municipality .
The low - ball bids touch on issues central to the increasingly tense trade debate .
Foreigners complain that they have limited access to government procurement in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , in part because <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> companies unfairly undercut them .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> has accused <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> companies of excessively slashing prices on semiconductors and supercomputers -- products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NEC</ENAMEX> make .
Asked whether the bidding flap would hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - Japan relations , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yamamoto</ENAMEX> said , `` this will be a minus factor . ''
The `` <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">one - yen</ENAMEX> '' controversy first came to a head <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> when the city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX> announced that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> won a contract to design a computer system to map its waterworks .
The city had expected to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 11 million yen</ENAMEX> -LRB- $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">77,000</ENAMEX> -RRB- , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> essentially offered to do it for free .
Then <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> said it made a similar bid to win a library contract in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagano</ENAMEX> prefecture <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks earlier</ENAMEX> .
It also said that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> , it bid <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000 yen</ENAMEX> to design a system for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saitama</ENAMEX> prefectural library , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> , it bid <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">one yen</ENAMEX> to plan the telecommunications system for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wakayama</ENAMEX> prefecture .
The company said it has offered to withdraw its bids in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagano</ENAMEX> .
The municipalities said they have n't decided whether to try to force the company to go through with the contracts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NEC</ENAMEX> said they were still investigating , and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yamamoto</ENAMEX> insisted that headquarters had n't approved the bids , and that he did n't know about most of the cases until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> .
Other major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> computer companies contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> said they have never made such bids .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">One yen</ENAMEX> is not ethical , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michio Sasaki</ENAMEX> , an official at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Keidanren</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations</ENAMEX> , said .
`` Profit may be low , but at least costs should be covered .
