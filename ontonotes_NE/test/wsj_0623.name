It was down a little .
The next time you hear a Member of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> moan about the deficit , consider what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> did <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</ENAMEX> - 6 , voted to increase to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">124,000</ENAMEX> the ceiling on insured mortgages from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FHA</ENAMEX> , which lost <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.2 billion</ENAMEX> in loan defaults <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
Then , by voice vote , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> voted a pork - barrel bill , approved <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> , for domestic military construction .
Compare the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> request to what the Senators gave themselves :
For construction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> requested <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.5 million</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> gave Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX> 's state <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21.5 million</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Senator Byrd</ENAMEX> is chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 million</ENAMEX> request became <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 million</ENAMEX> for Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grassley</ENAMEX> , ranking minority member of a military construction subcommittee .
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Whitten</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> and chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House Appropriations</ENAMEX> turned a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> request for his state into a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 49.7 million</ENAMEX> bequest .
Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sasser</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> is chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Appropriations</ENAMEX> subcommittee on military construction ; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 87 million</ENAMEX> request for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> increased to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 109 million</ENAMEX> .
In a remark someone should remember this time <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> , Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sasser</ENAMEX> said , `` I think we 've seen the peak of military construction spending for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</ENAMEX> to come . ''

Tell us what measure , short of house arrest , will get this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> under control .
