<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> is expected to launch its own program trading vehicle <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , just as controversy over this trading strategy heats up .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</ENAMEX> plans to begin trading its Exchange Stock Portfolio `` basket '' product , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> program - trading vehicle carrying the exchange 's seal of approval .
ESPs will allow institutional investors to buy or sell all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> stocks in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Standard -AMP- Poor 's</ENAMEX> index in a single trade of a minimum of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million</ENAMEX> .
`` Customized '' baskets of fewer stocks will also be available .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> gave provisional <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> approval to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> basket at a meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late yesterday</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chicago Board Options Exchange</ENAMEX> , where the minimum will be <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.7 million</ENAMEX> .
Also approved was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">regular hours</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Midwest Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
The basket products are `` an evolutionary step '' in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> market crash , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> Commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Grundfest</ENAMEX> .
New <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> , overseeing his first public meeting , said there have been concerns that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board 's</ENAMEX> basket could attract investors with a `` short - term perspective '' who would rapidly turn over the product , thus increasing volatility .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Ketchum</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> 's market regulation chief , said he did n't believe `` this will spawn dramatic new program - trading strategies that will be destabilizing . ''
The baskets on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBOE</ENAMEX> -- which involve the actual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">S-AMP-P</ENAMEX> stocks , unlike the stock - index contracts currently traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> futures markets , and index options on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBOE</ENAMEX> -- will begin trading as critics step up their attacks on program trading and its contributions to the stock market 's wild price swings .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Big Board</ENAMEX> argues that its new product will help rather than hurt the situation by possibly drawing business from more - volatile forms of program trading .
ESPs are also an attempt by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> to head off the exodus of program trading business to overseas markets such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> officials also hope <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investors will become interested in the exchange 's product .
Already , many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board 's</ENAMEX> own floor traders are warning that the ESP baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</ENAMEX> - member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Alliance of Floor Brokers</ENAMEX> said the new product , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million</ENAMEX> minimum , will benefit only big institutional investors and could lead to `` wild spasms of volatility . ''
Stockbrokers who cater to individual investors said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board 's</ENAMEX> new product confirms the exchange does n't want to curtail program trading , which <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> accounted for a record <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.8 %</ENAMEX> of the exchange 's average <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> volume .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> is losing its cool here , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Andrews</ENAMEX> , head of institutional trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> .
The new stock baskets `` are going to make it easier for program trading to be done .
And it 's going to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places . ''
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board 's</ENAMEX> Exchange Stock Portfolio and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> exchange 's Market Basket are designed for institutional investors .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Big Board</ENAMEX> lists its targets as pension plans , mutual fund managers and index - arbitrage traders .
In index arbitrage , program traders buy and sell stocks and stock - index futures to profit from small price discrepancies between the markets .
At the same time , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</ENAMEX> securities firms have signed up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> to buy and sell ESPs as market makers , an unenthusiastic response .
The market makers so far are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CS First Boston Group 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> unit , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Morgan Stanley -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber Group Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salomon Inc. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> unit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder , Peabody -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> unit that has become the biggest program trader along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> , is n't a market maker , although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> hopes that will change .
Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> hopes to entice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch -AMP- Co</ENAMEX> .
Neither has plans to be a market maker for now .
Traders said major securities firms are reluctant to become market makers because they fear the baskets may attract only limited trading .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> officials say <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 25</ENAMEX> contracts a day may trade at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> , equivalent to a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> 's action at a small , regional exchange .
Even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> says its product represents a post-crash `` reform , '' some traders suggest that if the new basket had been trading during this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">month</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday the 13th</ENAMEX> market plunge , the Dow Jones Industrial Average might have dropped more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</ENAMEX> points it did .
With the futures locked into a trading halt <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 13</ENAMEX> and trading in some individual stock difficult , program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system , the traders say .
`` If we had the baskets , we would be leaving in caskets , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> trader said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> said the after - hours trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Midwest</ENAMEX> exchange would help the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> win back business that has moved overseas to conduct after - hours trades .
