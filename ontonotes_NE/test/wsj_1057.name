<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">One day last March</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS Sports</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal Pilson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX> superagent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Frank</ENAMEX> met for lunch at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Lotos Club</ENAMEX> here .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX> officials wanted <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 290 million</ENAMEX> or more for TV rights to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Winter Games</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> official said that price sounded fine .
At that price , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> was the only player at the table when negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Olympic Committee</ENAMEX> started in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 23</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Pound</ENAMEX> , a committee member , began by disclosing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> had refused to even bid .
Then , he asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> to raise his offer anyway : `` If we can have a number that starts with a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> , you can have a dea . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> and his team huddled in a hallway and took <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">just 10 minutes</ENAMEX> to return with a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 million</ENAMEX> offer .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pound</ENAMEX> responded , `` It 's a deal . ''
A beaming Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> announced his lastest coup at a news conference <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">that afternoon</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> 's rivals at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> grimaced at the price .
How could <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> get pushed into outbidding itself ?
Well , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> , mired in the ratings cellar and looking to sports as a way out , wanted to close the deal immediately and block its rivals from getting another chance to bid .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> has been put in the uncomfortable role of setting off a bidding frenzy for sports rights , a frenzy that the networks had hoped to avoid .
`` The price of poker has gone up , '' crows <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles M. Neinas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the College Football Association 's</ENAMEX> executive director .
With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> on a spending spree that may top <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.5 billion</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> of major sports events , the new bout of hyperinflation could jolt the entire broadcast business .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> itself could run up losses of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few hundred million dollars</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capital Cities / ABC Inc.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Electric Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> also risk losses if they outbid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> for other contracts .
While rights fees head skyward , ad rates wo n't .
Advertisers already are balking at higher prices .
`` The networks are paying too much for rights , '' warns adman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Isacsson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Young -AMP- Rubicam</ENAMEX> .
`` If they ask advertisers to absorb the costs , they 're likely to lose all but a few who need sports , above all . ''
Viewers may not be cheering , either .
Soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater clutter of commercials .
At the same time , some sports events will move off `` free '' television and onto cable or pay - cable , where <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> the nation 's TV homes ca n't see them .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> has changed the rules by throwing out the old basis for sports bids -- that is , can the network alone make a profit on it ?
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> emphasizes the ancillary benefits of positive press , contented affiliate stations , enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to watch other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> programs when the game is over .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion - dollar</ENAMEX> question is , How much are those benefits worth ?
Some TV people doubt they will materialize and argue that even if they do , they wo n't offset the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">multimillion - dollar</ENAMEX> deficits that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> could run up .
`` As we 've seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the '80s</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Werner</ENAMEX> , the president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ESPN</ENAMEX> sports channel , `` those deals can turn sour if the numbers do n't work .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years later</ENAMEX> , in a sea of red ink , the heroes can find themselves with a lot of explaining to do . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> pursues top sports `` to belie the fact that they are n't supporting affiliates , viewers and advertisers , '' charges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas H. Wyman</ENAMEX> , who was ousted as chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence A. Tisch</ENAMEX> bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.9 %</ENAMEX> stake in the company and took over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</ENAMEX> .
`` They lost the entertainment crown , and they needed one .
And they 've bought one . ''
On <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just three</ENAMEX> big deals -- for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> of baseball and for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Olympic Winter Games</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> bid a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.64 billion</ENAMEX> .
That 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">well over half a billion dollars</ENAMEX> more than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> were willing to pay .
-LRB- After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX> will be held <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> apart , with the revised schedule beginning with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</ENAMEX> games in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</ENAMEX> games in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
Now , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> -- a former college basketball player who says a good negotiator needs `` a level of focus and intellectual attention '' similar to a good athlete - s is facing the consequences of his own aggressiveness .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Next month</ENAMEX> , talks will begin on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> coveted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> contracts , for the pro and college basketball finals .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> is likely to spend whatever it takes to keep them .
The potential bill : <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 600 million</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several seasons</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</ENAMEX> jump .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A few months later</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> 's college and pro football contracts come up for renewal ; they could go for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $ 100 million</ENAMEX> more than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> now pays , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 % to 50 %</ENAMEX> rise .
`` What happens to those <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> basketball contracts will shape <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next five years</ENAMEX> of network sports , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Lund</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS Sports</ENAMEX> president now at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Multimedia Inc</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. William Grimes</ENAMEX> , former president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ESPN</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> may `` come in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> and say , ` We can overbid , too . '
And the winners will be the colleges , not either network .
Nor , by the way , advertisers . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> is an unlikely big spender .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980s</ENAMEX> , after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> had just bid <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a record $ 309 million</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Winter Games</ENAMEX> , he sniped at rivals for paying reckless prices .
`` I love <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> , but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and loudly , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Wussler</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS Sports</ENAMEX> president .
`` And yet his company is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> reason why rights are so high <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> . ''
Rivals carp at `` the principle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> , '' as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Watson</ENAMEX> once put it -- `` he 's always expounding that rights are too high , then he 's going crazy . ''
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">49 - year - old</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> is hardly a man to ignore the numbers .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yale</ENAMEX> law school graduate , he began his career in corporate law and then put in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Metromedia Inc.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Morris</ENAMEX> talent agency .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</ENAMEX> , he joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS Sports</ENAMEX> to head business affairs and , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years later</ENAMEX> , became its president .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> says that when he spoke out <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</ENAMEX> , `` I did n't say forever , and I did n't say every property . ''
The market changed , he adds .
And he is n't the only big spender : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> will pay <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a record $ 401 million</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Summer Games</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ESPN</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</ENAMEX> - owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capital Cities / ABC</ENAMEX> , will shell out <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> of baseball , airing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</ENAMEX> regular - season games a year .
`` Our competitors say we overbid them .
Who cares ?
Maybe we recognize values the other guys do n't , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> says .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> 's `` Major Events '' strategy jelled after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX> took over .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> recalls that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1986</ENAMEX> , after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> , he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX> took the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">90 - minute</ENAMEX> train ride back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> used this extended private audience to outline his ambitions .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX> , a billionaire in hotels and finance , was just learning the TV business .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Five months later</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX> took over as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> 's chief executive , and soon he was wielding sole approval each time Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> scribbled a frighteningly large figure on a slip of paper , sealed it in an envelope and gave it to sports negotiators .
Then , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1988</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX> urgently needed to make a bold statement to quell rumors that he might sell the network .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> gave him one : He bid <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 243 million</ENAMEX> for rights to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Winter Games</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albertville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> would n't bid even <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</ENAMEX> .
That started the still - raging bidding wars .
The `` Major Events '' strategy , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> says , is designed to notch a place for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> on the crowded TV dial of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</ENAMEX> .
It 's also a fast fix for an ailing image .
He sees flashy sports as the only way the last - place network can cut through the clutter of cable and VCRs , grab <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</ENAMEX> of new viewers and tell them about other shows premiering <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks later</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Next October</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> , for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time , wo n't have to start the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">season</ENAMEX> against the much - watched <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">National</ENAMEX> baseball league championships and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the World Series</ENAMEX> .
`` I 've been struggling against that for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Rodgers</ENAMEX> , who runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WBBM - TV</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> - owned station in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
Even if baseball triggers losses at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> -- and he does n't think it will -- `` I 'd rather see the games on our air than on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
That is n't surprising .
Regular TV series ratings have slumped in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five years</ENAMEX> , and premiering new shows is `` a crap shoot , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> says .
But top sports events are still a strong bet to lure audiences <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % or 40 %</ENAMEX> larger than those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> usually gets .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> says baseball and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX> may help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> move up to No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> in the household ratings race , putting pizazz back into the network 's image .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Winter Olympics</ENAMEX> will air during the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February</ENAMEX> `` sweeps , '' when ratings are used to set ad rates for local stations .
That will please once - grumpy affiliates -- another aim of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> plan .
They gleefully await the `` dream season '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> will air <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Super Bowl</ENAMEX> , baseball playoffs , college and pro basketball finals and other premier sports events .
`` It 's made me more committed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip A. Jones</ENAMEX> , the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Meredith Corp. 's</ENAMEX> broadcast group , which has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> affiliates .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> plan to use big - time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success , however .
No amount of hype will bring viewers back if the shows are weak .
`` In this market of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</ENAMEX> channels , sophisticated viewers and the remote control , trial is n't a guarantee of anything , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ESPN</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Werner</ENAMEX> says .
`` If the show ai n't a killer , they 're gone . ''
During the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Summer Games</ENAMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> touted `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Call to Glory</ENAMEX> , '' but the military drama was missing in action within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last October</ENAMEX> , during the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Summer Games</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> relentlessly pitched a new series , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tattingers</ENAMEX> . ''
It belly - flopped anyway .
Moreover , sports is hardly the best way to lure adult women .
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> might move up to No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> in household ratings , most advertisers buy based on ratings for women aged <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">18 to 49</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> may remain a distant No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</ENAMEX> in that regard .
Nor is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> a shoo - in to get blockbuster ratings .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the World Series</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX> were aired against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> 's last - place lineup .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> will put the athletes up against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Cosby</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cheers</ENAMEX> '' and other shows in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> schedule .
Even the boon to affiliate relations may be limited .
The sports lineup may add <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1 % to 5 %</ENAMEX> to a station 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> profits .
It alone is n't likely to stop a station from dumping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> shows .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">The World Series</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven nights</ENAMEX> , was n't enough of an incentive , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Klinsky</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WHEC - TV</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rochester</ENAMEX> , which dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks ago</ENAMEX> .
`` You 've got to judge where the network will be in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> . ''
The intangible benefits may prove extremely costly if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> ca n't avoid big losses on the sports coverage itself .
And avoiding such losses will take a monumental effort .
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.06 billion</ENAMEX> baseball agreement alone , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> is likely to lose <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> , contends Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wussler</ENAMEX> , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> man , now at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Comsat Inc</ENAMEX> .
Nevertheless , he deems the deal `` plain smart '' for its huge promotional value .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> calls that loss estimate `` wildly inaccurate , '' conceding only that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> will lose money on baseball in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's too early to tell '' what happens after that , he says .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX> expects losses in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">all four years</ENAMEX> of the contract , he told <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> senators <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last June</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> will pay an average of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 82 million</ENAMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> had paid together -- and those <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> networks expect losses on baseball this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">season</ENAMEX> .
Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> will air <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 12</ENAMEX> regular - season games , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</ENAMEX> fewer than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> .
That has outraged some fans .
It also indicates a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</ENAMEX> drop in ad sales for regular - season games -- a risk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> took to get an unprecedented lock on all playoff games .
If the playoffs end in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - game sweeps , losses could soar .
Advertisers are resisting higher prices , which would help close the gap .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> signed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Motors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota</ENAMEX> to be the only auto - maker sponsors in baseball for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> .
Price : <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 265 million</ENAMEX> .
But ad executives who negotiated the deal say that works out to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 275,000</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">30 - second</ENAMEX> ad in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the World Series</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</ENAMEX> less than what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> is charging for the Series <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</ENAMEX> .
Moreover , `` there 's no question ad rates will come down considerably '' from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> - Toyota price , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Chase</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bozell Inc</ENAMEX> .
Other admen , however , say rates could rise later if ad spending surges .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Winter Games</ENAMEX> outlook also is mixed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> expects to make modest profits , but rivals contend that it will take a beating .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> lost <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 million</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Winter Games</ENAMEX> , partly because of its <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 309 million</ENAMEX> rights fee .
It aired <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">94.5 hours</ENAMEX> of mostly live events in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calgary</ENAMEX> -- helping raise ratings slightly from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> -- but still failed to deliver the audience promised to advertisers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> will add <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">25 1/2 hours</ENAMEX> to that load in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> , and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events .
All prime - time fare will be on tape - delay because of time differences with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> , so the results can be announced on the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">6 o'clock</ENAMEX> news .
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Turner Broadcasting</ENAMEX> will pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 million</ENAMEX> to air <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">50 hours</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> coverage plus <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">50 hours</ENAMEX> of additional events . -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Frank</ENAMEX> , the agent who took Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> to lunch <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last March</ENAMEX> , says that even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> loses , say , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</ENAMEX> , it matters little .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten million</ENAMEX> ai n't jack , man , when you got <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</ENAMEX> sitting in the bank , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> , senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Management Group</ENAMEX> , citing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> 's enormous cash reserves from selling off various businesses .
`` It does n't mean anything -- it 's public - relations money . ''
Moreover , sports has `` claimed its place '' as a guaranteed ratings - getter , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David J. Stern</ENAMEX> , the commissioner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Basketball Association</ENAMEX> .
`` This is n't outlandish bidding ; this is a situation of very careful businessmen making judgments about the worth of product and acting on it ... .
I would tend to trust their judgment . ''
That 's easy for him to say : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBA</ENAMEX> pact , now at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 176 million</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> , could double in price by the time his talks with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> are completed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">later this month</ENAMEX> .
That would cut into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> 's slim margin for profit -- and error .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS Sports</ENAMEX> earned <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</ENAMEX> or so <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> takes in the least money in prime time ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> charge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % to 35 %</ENAMEX> more for ads , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Variety</ENAMEX> survey .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> 's costs are huge , and the risks go up with each new sports package that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> locks up .
Although sports officials predict jumps of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % to 100 %</ENAMEX> in the major contracts coming up for renewal , ad rates may rise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 20 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</ENAMEX> of prime time .
But the savings will be minuscule .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Each hour</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX> and baseball in prime time will cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.6 million to $ 2.8 million</ENAMEX> ; an <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hour - long</ENAMEX> drama costs <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 900,000</ENAMEX> , and it is aired twice .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> may cushion losses with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 200 million</ENAMEX> a year in interest earned on the proceeds from selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS Records</ENAMEX> and other businesses .
But media - stock analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard J. MacDonald</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MacDonald Grippo Riely</ENAMEX> says Wall Street wo n't take kindly to that .
`` On a stand - alone basis , the network ought to make money , '' he says .
When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> is asked directly -- can you make money on all this ? -- he does n't exactly say yes .
`` What you 're really asking is , Are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management ? '' he says .
Then , he answers his own question .
`` Yes , they are .
That 's the only question we need to address .
