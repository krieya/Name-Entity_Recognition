This track and field championship competition began on <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning of August 27th</ENAMEX> .
More than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> male and female athletes from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</ENAMEX> provinces , cities , autonomous regions , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PLA</ENAMEX> and industry sports associations participated in the competition , fighting for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</ENAMEX> gold medals .
Due to preparation for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Asian Games</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX> , most of the good national track and field competitors did not sign up to participate in the competition this time round , only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</ENAMEX> members of the national team appeared in events such as sprinting , relays , the high jump , the long jump , shot - put , etc. , the medium to long run women 's team from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Liaoning province</ENAMEX> did not come either .
Coupled with the big re-adjustment of many teams after the national sports meet <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , a large number of good team members have retired , and newcomers just took over , therefore the overall standard of this competition was not high and no excellent results appeared .
However , what is satisfying is that , a group of juveniles that are <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seventeen years of age</ENAMEX> emerged .
The youngest aged was only <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">14 years old</ENAMEX> .
Among them are some stars of hope .
For instance , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">17 - year old</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jie Feng</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hebei</ENAMEX> team achieved a good result of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.58 meters</ENAMEX> in the women 's long jump final , and won the silver medal in this event , breaking the national youth record .
Experts believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jie Feng 's</ENAMEX> conditions in terms of body form , springing , jumping , etc. are rather good , and development potential is very great .
