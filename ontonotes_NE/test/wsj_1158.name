Medieval philosophers used to hold the sensible belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist , and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all .
Now , only God exists as a matter of absolute necessity ; it is built into His nature .
But since the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> , we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species .
Are n't we , after all , the inevitable culmination of that stately pageant called evolution ?
If mutation and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life , then it was only a matter of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eons</ENAMEX> before splendid beings endowed with reason , self - awareness and taste shimmered onto the scene .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Now</ENAMEX> along comes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Jay Gould</ENAMEX> to dash this flattering illusion .
His credentials are excellent for the task .
Star lecturer at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvard</ENAMEX> , author of numerous popular books on science , and scourge of the creationist lobby , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> is perhaps the world 's most eminent evolutionary theorist .
Yet he puts quite a twist on the old story handed down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> .
For him , natural history is anything but a gradual , predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness ; it is a careening , chaotic affair in which the emergence of a featherless biped was a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - in - a - million shot .
In `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wonderful Life : The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Norton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">326</ENAMEX> pages , $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">19.95</ENAMEX> -RRB- , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> makes his case for `` the awesome improbability of human evolution . ''
The argument turns on the discovery in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1909</ENAMEX> of an amazing fossil quarry high in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Rockies</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Burgess Shale</ENAMEX> .
Here , in an area smaller than a city block , lay buried traces of countless weird creatures that had frolicked <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 500 million years ago</ENAMEX> -- creatures whose anatomical variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world 's oceans <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
Such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the man who discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Burgess Shale</ENAMEX> , one <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Doolittle Walcott</ENAMEX> .
The received <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Darwinian</ENAMEX> wisdom of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design , limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species .
Accordingly , the hidebound traditionalist reconstructed hypothetical organisms from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Burgess</ENAMEX> fossils in such a way that they could be shoehorned into familiar categories .
It was not until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1970s</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Whittington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sharp graduate students began to publish a reinterpretation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Burgess Shale</ENAMEX> .
By making clever inferences about how the squashed and distorted fossil remains corresponded to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> - dimensional structures , this trio was able to piece together a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on the planet .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> was so fantastic in appearance , it was dubbed Hallucigenia .
Would that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> 's minute descriptions of these creatures was always so colorful .
A good deal of the book is boring , particularly the endless allusions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text .
These turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like , `` Most modern chelicerates have <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> uniramous appendages on the prosoma . ''
Interest picks up , though , when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> gets around to discussing the meaning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Burgess</ENAMEX> oddities for the theory of evolution .
Not long after the appearance of life , evidently , there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">earth</ENAMEX> .
The vast majority of them , however , were wiped out by a succession of environmental upheavals that were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of natural selection to operate .
Consequently , the winnowing process was like a lottery `` in which each group -LCB- held -RCB- a ticket unrelated to its anatomical virtues .
'' So much for survival of the fittest .
So much , too , for the notion that we humans triumphed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Darwinian</ENAMEX> struggle by evolving big brains .
Our mammalian forerunners lucked out through the extraterrestrial impact that did in the dinosaurs because they were small , not smart .
If anyone has difficulty imagining a world in which history went merrily on without us , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> sketches several .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> , birds are the dominant carnivores ; in another the seas abound with `` little penises . ''
Back when the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Burgess</ENAMEX> fauna were flourishing , it seems , human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a backbone called Pikaia .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> finds this oddly exhilarating ; like an existentialist of old , he views our contingency as `` a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility . ''
I , by contrast , can not help feeling that if some other curiosity from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Burgess Shale</ENAMEX> had survived instead , beings at once wiser and less boorish than Homo sapiens might have eventually gained earthly dominion .
But even if no conscious life had evolved here at all , the universe is a big place , and given the right conditions , sympathetic to creating some form of life .
Surely at some other cosmic address a Gouldoid creature would have risen out of the ooze to explain why , paleontologically speaking , `` it is , indeed , a wonderful life . ''
