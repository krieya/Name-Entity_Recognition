The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration , urging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to give states more leeway to restrict abortions , said minors have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents .
Solicitor General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> argued that the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decision , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roe</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX> , recognizing a constitutional right to abortion , was incorrect .
He also argued that the high court was wrong in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</ENAMEX> to rule that minors have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely vetoed by their parents .
The administration 's position was outlined in a friend - of - the - court brief filed in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> abortion cases <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> will hear argued and will decide this term .
The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion .
The administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Rehnquist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last July</ENAMEX> when the high court upheld <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> 's abortion restrictions .
Under that standard , which garnered the votes of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</ENAMEX> justices , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a `` reasonable '' justification for adopting it .
That is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court 's</ENAMEX> test since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</ENAMEX> , which requires a state to have a `` compelling '' reason for restricting abortion .
On the provisions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> law , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows minors to go to court for a judge 's permission instead .
The case , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hodgson</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> , will be argued <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 29</ENAMEX> .
