Concerning your <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 29</ENAMEX> article `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Retailers Face Cutbacks , Uncertain Future</ENAMEX> '' : The outcome of our leveraged buyout is looking very positive .
Unlike most of the other retailers mentioned in the story , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc.</ENAMEX> is not in serious financial problems .
We did experience some difficulties with the initial LBO terms and , as your article made clear , successfully restructured our debt <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> , something those other retailers have yet to accomplish .
Your were on target regarding industry problems , but wide of the mark in portraying the financial health of this company .
Chairman and CEO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Owings Mills</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Md .</ENAMEX>
