<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> began opening its borders , just slightly , so that some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> could go back to work .
Officials say the block over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two months</ENAMEX> has been necessary for security , but for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaza</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the West Bank</ENAMEX> , it has been an economic nightmare .
Here 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillian Findlay</ENAMEX> .
This is how bad it has gotten for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmad Al - dour</ENAMEX> .
Out of work , out of savings , he is now trying to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the few valuables he has left .
The most important thing is to buy milk for the children , says this father of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> .
I do n't care about the price .
I just need to sell it .
These days , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaza</ENAMEX> 's central market is filled with people who need to sell .
TV's , stereos , even bicycles .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX> 's parents told him they needed the money for food .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> says it closed its borders for security reasons , but the economic impact here has been devastating .
It 's not just that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> who used to work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> are unemployed , construction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaza</ENAMEX> has all but stopped .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> has blocked cement supplies .
Gas is also in short supply , and from time to time , so is food .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">just three months</ENAMEX> , the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> living below the poverty line has risen by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> now live on <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 2</ENAMEX> a day .
Their economy , which had been growing , now loses <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $ 9 million</ENAMEX> a day .
I really do n't think we have much longer than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of January</ENAMEX> before real disaster starts hitting from the economic point of view .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Five years ago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bashar Al - masri</ENAMEX> gave up a successful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> investment career to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ramallah</ENAMEX> and help build the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> state .
Business was good , he says , until the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> started their uprising .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> began shooting back .
The bullet came in here and hit the wall right here .
And all of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - masri</ENAMEX> 's investors fled .
Soon , he says , he will have no choice but to lay off his staff , making more people unemployed , more people desperate .
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> think that things are going to get better , they are going to get much , much worse because you are going to have many more people who are hopeless .
Hopeless , and angry .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> says it wants security .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> say , strangling them economically is only going to make things worse .
