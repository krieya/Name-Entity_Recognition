What does n't belong here ?
A. manual typewriters , B. black - and - white snapshots , C. radio adventure shows .
If you guessed black - and - white snapshots , you 're right .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> of fading into the background , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - tone photography is coming back .
Trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black - and - white photos of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> celebrities pitching jeans , shoes and liquor .
Portrait studios accustomed to shooting only in color report a rush to black - and - white portrait orders .
And black - and - white photography classes are crowded with students .
What 's happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion , home furnishings and cinematography .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Seventh Avenue</ENAMEX> , designers have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done entirely in black and white .
And classic black - and - white movies are enjoying a comeback on videocassette tapes , spurred , in part , by the backlash against colorization of old films .
`` The pendulum is swinging back to black and white , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard DeMoulin</ENAMEX> , the general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastman Kodak Co. 's</ENAMEX> professional photography division .
Until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> , sales of black - and - white film had been declining steadily since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , buoyed by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications , sales increased <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> , and they are expected to jump at least that much again <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
Photographic companies are scrambling to tap the resurging market , reviving some black - and - white product lines and developing new ones .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kodak</ENAMEX> , which largely ignored the market for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> , black - and - white film sales now account for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 15 %</ENAMEX> of the company 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</ENAMEX> in film and paper sales <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</ENAMEX> , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rochester</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , photographic giant recently began marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T - Max 3200</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the fastest and most sensitive monochrome films .
Aimed at commercial photographers , the film can be used in very low light without sacrificing quality , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Franz</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Photofinishing Newsletter</ENAMEX> .
Also trying to snare a portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</ENAMEX> - a - year industry is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Agfa Corp.</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bayer AG</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Agfa</ENAMEX> recently signed <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> gold medalist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florence Griffith - Joyner</ENAMEX> to endorse a new line of black - and - white paper that 's geared to consumers and will compete directly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kodak</ENAMEX> 's papers .
Slated for market by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</ENAMEX> , the paper `` could have been introduced a long time ago but the market was n't there then , '' says an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Agfa</ENAMEX> spokesman .
The biggest beneficiary of the black - and - white revival is likely to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Paper Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ilford</ENAMEX> division , known in the industry for its premium products .
Sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ilford</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> varieties of black - and - white film <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> are outpacing growth in the overall market , although the company wo n't say by exactly how much .
`` We hope the trend lasts , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurie DiCara</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ilford</ENAMEX> 's marketing communications director .
Why all the interest ?
For baby boomers who grew up being photographed in color , black and white seems eye - catching and exotic .
`` It has an archival , almost nostalgic quality to it , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen B. Butler</ENAMEX> , the chairman of the applied photography department at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rochester Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> .
`` You can shift out of reality with black and white , '' he adds .
Such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives , who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising .
Processing of black - and - white commercial film jumped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.7 million</ENAMEX> rolls .
Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gap Inc.</ENAMEX> , whose latest ad campaign features black - and - white shots of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> stars , artists and other well - known personalities modeling the retailer 's jeans and T - shirts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Crisman</ENAMEX> , the account manager for the campaign , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gap</ENAMEX> did n't intentionally choose black and white to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of competitors .
`` We wanted to highlight the individual , not the environment , '' he says , `` and black and white allows you to do that better than color . ''
The campaign won a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cleo</ENAMEX> award as this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> 's best ad by a specialty retailer .
Even food products and automobiles , which have long depended on color , are making the switch .
Companies `` feel black and white will convey a stronger statement , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc L. Hauser</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> photographer who is working on a black - and - white print ad for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Stouffer Food Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lean Cuisine</ENAMEX> .
Other companies that are currently using <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - tone ads include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Epson America Inc</ENAMEX> .
Portrait studios have also latched onto the trend .
Using black and white , `` we can make housewives look like stars , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Perrin</ENAMEX> .
His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">On - Broadway Photography</ENAMEX> studio in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ore.</ENAMEX> , doubled its business <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> and , he says , is booked solid for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next five</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> customer , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dayna Brunsdon</ENAMEX> , says she spurned a color portrait for black and white because `` it 's more dramatic .
I show it to my friends , and they all say ` wow . '
It is n't ordinary like color . ''
Still , most consumers are n't plunking black - and - white film into their cameras to take family snapshots .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> big obstacle is that few drugstores develop the film anymore .
Typically , it must be mailed to a handful of processors and may take a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> or more to be processed and returned .
Black - and - white film costs consumers a little less than color film , and processing costs the same .
But for photofinishers , developing costs for black - and - white film are higher .
Some companies are starting to tackle that problem .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ilford</ENAMEX> , for example , recently introduced a black - and - white film that can be processed quickly by color labs .
Intent on wooing customers , the company is also increasing its sponsorship of black - and - white photography classes .
Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Agfa</ENAMEX> is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high schools and colleges , offering free black - and - white film and paper as prizes .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kodak</ENAMEX> is distributing an instructional video to processors on how to develop its monochrome film more efficiently .
Other companies are introducing related products .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Charles Beseler Co.</ENAMEX> , a leading maker of photographic enlargers , introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> a complete darkroom starter kit targeted at teen - agers who want to process their own black - and - white photographs .
The kit , which has a suggested retail price of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">250</ENAMEX> and has already become a bestseller , was introduced after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children 's photography equipment .
`` It seems computers as hobbies have waned , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian Brightman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Beseler</ENAMEX> 's chairman and chief executive officer .
But some industry observers believe the resurgence of black and white is only a fad .
They cite the emergence of still electronic photography , more newspapers turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints .
`` Black and white has n't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Rochester Institute</ENAMEX> .
`` The color print <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> is far superior to prints of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years ago</ENAMEX> .
You ca n't say the same with black and white . ''
But when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Popular Photography</ENAMEX> , a leading magazine for photographers , selected <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">150th</ENAMEX> anniversary , all were black and white .
`` It 's got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred DeBat</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Professional Photographers of America</ENAMEX> .
`` That 's the appeal .
