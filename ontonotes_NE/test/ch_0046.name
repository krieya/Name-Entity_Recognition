a little
Laura What did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura</ENAMEX> say ? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura</ENAMEX> saw it
and an- her her comments were that the commentators seem pretty high on the Skins
yeah
everyone did
actually she
although I have to say after the game last night %um beating Saint L- or whatever <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phoenix</ENAMEX> oh wha- or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> whatever they 're called was certainly no great feat
I- I know %eh
but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX>
they are awful
%eh
They 're really bad
How 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penn</ENAMEX> doing
Penn is not yet it has n't started
oh it has n't started yet
oh I did n't realize that
nope
but I will keep you
how come <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura</ENAMEX> 's team started
I do n't think we played this week
yeah
the
No
I think you 're right
the Ivies start later
see we do n't play as many games
right
d- how did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura</ENAMEX> 's do
Well
that figures
I have n't heard from her
bu-
Well write to her
she 'll like that
I try
it 's so hard mom
you do n't understand how little time I have to do anything these days
Yes I do
and it 's like impossible
I 've been waiting to find <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a half an hour</ENAMEX> when I could call because I can only use like it 's like I have to use the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">half hour</ENAMEX>
and there has n't been a time where I actually could just sit on the phone for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a half hour</ENAMEX>
oh
oh We have to go talk for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a half an hour</ENAMEX>
you ca n't split it up ?
No
Not for free
oh
that 's weird
Well this is something very important
We got the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Washingtonian</ENAMEX>
yeah
uh-huh
and they sa-
but did you get <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Playboy</ENAMEX> ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Playboy</ENAMEX> ?
yeah
a girl in my class is in it .
What
I told you about that .
A girl in my med school class is in this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">month</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Playboy</ENAMEX>
oh
oh I did n't realize that
I thought it was a long time ago <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Playboy</ENAMEX>
No that was when she she did the posing over the Summer
yeah
oh I see
but it 's this month
%hm
Yes
it was very funny at the train station yesterday When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliot</ENAMEX> went to go get his %um what you called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baron</ENAMEX> 's whatever
and I 'm like oh do they have <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Playboy</ENAMEX> here
let 's get it
yeah
%eh
and everybody is looking at me
Do you know her
What ?
Do you know her ?
yeah
I know her well
she 's a little bit weird
She 's beautiful
%hm
This is strange
does n't that seem like a strange thing to do
Yes
I think so
I think it 's
I mean what kind of a reception did it get ?
Mostly just like a gossipy I mean
you mean the actual picture
I mea-
i-
No I I meant I no no I meant what you 're saying
just gossip
just as you
yeah
just everybody talking about it
I think it 's a s- a very peculiar way to launch your medical career
and I agree
anyway so what about <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Washingtonian</ENAMEX>
y-
very foolish girl
no it 's going to follow her
that 'll follow her forever
mhm
but what abo-
It really might not be bad
oh come on Bo-
It 's a good picture
yeah
but is that the kind are going to want go to a doctor who has been a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Playboy</ENAMEX> bunny ?
You 'd be surprised what people will go to
I did n't say I would
but you 'd be surprised what people will do
Well I w-
It 's it 's publicity
maybe going to med school was a great way to launch her career as a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Playboy</ENAMEX> model
that 's right
Is that what she said
no
anyway So what about Washington-
Well what was it no well what was
alright <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Washingtonian</ENAMEX> is a lot more important
They said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maid Brigade</ENAMEX> is a national franchise
So y- you if you need a maid you can call <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maid Brigade</ENAMEX>
and you could get
oh god
but I I already cleaned up my apartment
yeah
but it 'll get dirty again
believe me
But I told I wrote you about how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliot</ENAMEX> cleaned it up this weekend did n't I ?
But does he always want to do it ?
No
and he did n't clean it like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maid Brigade</ENAMEX> would
he just picked the papers up off the floor
I I sort of had a feeling that might be the case
He cleaned the ki- he actually cleaned up the kitchen a little bit . di- and made and got brunch
that was especially good
Did you get my message about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>
that you 'll try and that I should make su-
no
that
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</ENAMEX>
How many days and all
yeah
I think I get there <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">around noon</ENAMEX>
Lau-
and that 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the three days</ENAMEX>
that 's not in %uh
if you get there <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</ENAMEX> that means you wo n't get like to a hotel and everything until <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">three in the afternoon</ENAMEX> --
that 's days
yeah
-- so you have the evening
you have <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> evening
okay well I can do another day
the problem is that like cuts down my time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>
yeah
tha-
oh oh well %hm
like I do n't I do n't have that much time
I had to leave on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX>
Do you have to make the do you have to make the decision that when you go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> now
I mean can you change the reservation with no cost later
I 've got until like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">twentieth</ENAMEX> I think
no no no
I mean once you 've done it and you 're coming out here and you decide you want to leave a day early
I thought you know how those things are I could probably go standby
but the thing is the flights are really packed
they are ?
that 's the trouble
well well the packed flights
I sure to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> might not be packed
right
granted
that 's
what I mean th- th- th- you could move that par-
except there 's the flights from there to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>
are the flights back to the States
and we 're talking like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January first</ENAMEX>
Well that 's true
yeah
and so that 's when everybody goes back
but But you 're not going to change that
You 're right
No no
not that
you 're missing the point
the point my point is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United</ENAMEX> flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> yeah is one that goes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U S</ENAMEX>
It 'll be crowded
yeah
%um <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U S</ENAMEX>
yeah
So those flights will still be tight
You would n't believe how much trouble I had getting reservations
oh
yeah
I would
I believe it
yeah
I figured %uh
actually We 're having trouble Now all the places are full because like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX> ha- was wait listed I was wait listed to get to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>
mhm
and then this this woman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh Turbush</ENAMEX> that
mhm
You know our friend here
She 's trying to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> on this week
and she 's been trying for weeks
but she ca n't get on
well that 's that 's %uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> is is very crowded
mhm
yeah
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> are just %oof %uh really apparently travel
yeah
but I mean the time of year does n't matter
no
apparently it does n't matter
yeah
you should have heard
it was amazing
I called every airline as you know only I can do
right
and I called %uh it was with much hesitancy that I called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Continental</ENAMEX> because I hate them so much
yeah
I was on hold for ten minutes while she figured out this route
I should 've known that if it took her ten minutes I should 've hung up
She had me st- go from like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L A</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guam</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE" E_OFF="1">Singapo-</ENAMEX>
I mean she had me everywhere
I think they 're the only ones who go to
and she 'd for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">three thousand dollars</ENAMEX>
I was like are you joking
Uy
oh I have take fr-
in a couple weeks I have to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guam</ENAMEX>
and they 're the only ones that go there
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Continental</ENAMEX> ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Continental</ENAMEX>
yeah
That 's funny
good luck
can you at least go business class
I do n't know if I can or not
yeah
oh by the way you were right with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Singapore Air</ENAMEX>
it 's only business class or first class goes Right miles to frequent flyers
Right
yeah
They go %um <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Singapore Air</ENAMEX> takes you around through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Europe</ENAMEX>
they do a route that way
yeah
yeah
that 's how they like to go
if if I you know could have gone specially through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>
right
but that was more a little bit more expensive
and they they al- they also have connections with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Delta</ENAMEX>
yeah
they only give miles on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Delta</ENAMEX>
but you can buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Delta</ENAMEX> seats on there
right
well that 's they were actually they were going to send me on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">T W A</ENAMEX>
I almost thought it would be worth it to do that instead of the United because %uh fewer connections but I th- instead of connecting in %um
%eh well I mean it is a lot further to go through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and all that nonsense
but the problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Singapore Air</ENAMEX> is I have to through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">J F K</ENAMEX> . Uy which I now remember going from the domestic terminal to the international terminal
right
well <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">T W A</ENAMEX> is not too bad
you have to walk a little bit
but
yeah
no
I mean it 's just not shi- it just yeah it 's not saving me much if I have to go through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> is a bad place to layover
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> is a ba-
and I have like an <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hour</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">five hour</ENAMEX> layover there
I know
yeah
usually
yeah
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">five hours</ENAMEX>
It 's crazy
It 's not that bad by the time you slept
it 's such a it 's really
No
but it 's annoying that I have to go through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> that I ca n't just fly from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> home
right
that is annoying
I 'm surprised you did n't go Hong Ko-
the the- They do have route-
where 's does it go
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> to where ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>
yeah
was it is
or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>
yes
but it 's full
United does have that
oh it 's full
I see
at that the other I mean at that price level I could pay more probably %mm which maybe I 'll look it
maybe I 'll find out how much more I have to pay
Can you get on a waiting list ?
Can you get on a waiting list
I 'll find out when I call back to confirm
Yes ,
it 's worth waiting l-
%eh with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> is much better
where 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> take you to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> to where
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>
I do n't know if it 's the same old same old
oh oh no
yes
same thing
yeah
yeah
Well at least put yourself on the waiting list
can you do that ?
yeah
probably
but I have a feeling it 's like a price thing
Might not be
I do n't know
