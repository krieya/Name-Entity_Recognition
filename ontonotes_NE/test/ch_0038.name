he said he was all right and was going to be playing
and in fact he 's supposed to be here in %uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of next month</ENAMEX> .

but he 's the he 's the same as he always has been you know .
Where 's he living these days ?
%ah out on the island ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhasset</ENAMEX> I think .
%eh I ca n't keep track of him .

But he 's fine
So how did you like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> ?
Well I had a good time Al ,
shit .
Had you been there before ?
yeah
I was there in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteen ninety</ENAMEX> uh-huh . %uh with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Percy Faith</ENAMEX> ,
but we did n't have very much to play ,
we did n't have that much more to play with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Vaughan</ENAMEX>
but we had
I ca n't believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Vaughan</ENAMEX> is still going ,
I mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX> and those cats were going <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">over thirty years ago</ENAMEX> .
yeah
I know it ,
well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Vaughan</ENAMEX> passed away <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</ENAMEX>
So %uh but this guy is big over there ,
I mean we had unbelievable crowds .
Well yeah
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> they turn out .

I went over with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mel</ENAMEX> of course in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seventy - five</ENAMEX>
yeah .
And then %uh %uh when the hell was it <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years ago</ENAMEX> I went over with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Miller</ENAMEX> band from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holland</ENAMEX> .
%mm oh , was that the one with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zeke</ENAMEX> ?

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zeke</ENAMEX> was on it .
Have you talked to him about it ?
Well yeah ,
well we talked about it on the road because he was on the trip that I did you know
yeah
he makes all those trips .
yeah
he was funny .
Amazing at his age At his age . still blowing and still drinking .
y- ho does he drink
yeah
He 's amazing .
But he played good ,
I was glad he was there because I had these young cats all good jazz players but no band experience .
uh-huh .
I had to rehearse them every day of the tour
I have a tape of the last concert in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>
and it was pretty good .
And there my chops were up
I played Jubilee with the high G on the end
and Wow . I sang <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chattanooga Choo Choo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Serenade -AMP-in Blue</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fiesta -AMP-in Blue</ENAMEX>
and %uh %eh that 's where I %ah met this girl singer from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holland</ENAMEX>
she impressed me so much that I got her on my band <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about three years ago</ENAMEX> .
oh what 's her name ?
%eh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lydia Van Damme</ENAMEX> .
mhm
Anyhow she 's not with me anymore because I discovered another great s- y- singer here
she 's been with me since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February</ENAMEX> .
%uh let me back up now .
okay .
So I 've been doing all these workshops since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> ,
and I 've been doing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Borghausen</ENAMEX> thing
and then in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February</ENAMEX> finally there 's a beautiful club here
but it 's it 's a weird scene
it %uh I say weird for us .
It 's this beautiful club
but they go from like <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">eleven</ENAMEX> till <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">five in the morning</ENAMEX>
and there 's no %eh admission .
It 's the young jet set , you know young people with money
they stay up all night ,
and he has live music every night .
Anyhow , I 've been talking about trying to get a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> night around here for years you know something like the Vanguard
yeah
with your band
%eh yeah
and it finally happened
so we started in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Every two weeks</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX>
and it 's been a huge success .
Great
Of course we did everything <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> class
new new music stands new music stand lights a big curtain in the back with our big logo there and %uh so forth and so on
and this new girl singer
and she plays trumpet
No .
I 've known her for years as a trumpet player
she went to all the music schools here .
%huh . She 's a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> chick
And sh-
%huh ?
yeah
Germ-
and she sings great .
I got to send you a tape man
so it 's been a huge success
and then of course in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May</ENAMEX> to celebrate my birthday we brought in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Mariano</ENAMEX>
uh-huh .
And I have a video of that .
We also got a mitchnit that night from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bayerischer Rundfunk</ENAMEX>
so it was a great night .
My <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventieth</ENAMEX> birthday
and %uh we finished <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month ago</ENAMEX>
and I 'm taking a little break now although I 'm still busy
I 'm doing another %uh workshop soon
and I 'm getting all this music together
and %uh we did a job <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week ago</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Augsburg</ENAMEX>
it was part of a jazz festival there
and that went very well
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five hundred</ENAMEX> people there .
mhm .
Anyhow we start our new %uh season <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October ninth</ENAMEX>
and we 're going to have a guest soloist <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">every two weeks</ENAMEX> for the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Mondays</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> we we 're actually planning on going every <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX>
%eh oh I did n't tell you our hours .
the no-
Well yeah
you did <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">eleven</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">five</ENAMEX>
Well that 's the normal hours when they bring in these rock groups and weird groups
%eh the people do n't care what it is .
It 's so damn loud in there it do n't make any difference
it 's just live mu-
We play from <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">eight thirty</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">eleven</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Mondays</ENAMEX> .
yeah
oh great .
So it 's a different crowd %eh older crowd
and then some young people too
and we 're actually building our own following
and it 's great
and %eh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annetta</ENAMEX> the singer is breaking it up
and I 'm playing back in the section again although my chops are not up to play lead like I did before
mhm
but I 'm going to %uh start section rehearsals <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</ENAMEX> and hope to get back in shape by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> .
Do you still have your original rhythm section
or are they too busy now ?
Well %eh
The ones you recorded with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Cone</ENAMEX> and all of that .
No ,
well that was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eighty - seven</ENAMEX>
yeah .
No ,
but I have great replacements
I got lucky you know
up until I got that drummer and the piano player especially from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karlsruhe</ENAMEX> there wa- I was %eh f- if I did n't have them I would be out of business because there was nobody else around .
Now there 's a lot of good young players popping up in fact now with my band on these Mondays because like my trumpet players my <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> lead players they 're busy all the times .
So I 've had to get subs
and before it was always a problem .
Now there 's these good young players I mean good from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stuttgart</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nuremberg</ENAMEX>
Where are they where are they coming from ?
and they 're willing to come here to
Where are they coming from
through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jig</ENAMEX> 's school or something ?
All the different schools
yeah
in fact <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about %uh three weeks ago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brookmeyer</ENAMEX> was here for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</ENAMEX> .
He went on tour with an allstar band of these young new upcoming players
%hm
%hm
They 're the best of the new crop .
These <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> new trumpet pliers I 've been using them as subs
and %uh they 're willing to come from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stuttgart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nuremberg</ENAMEX> anywhere to play with me .
wow great .
Whereas my cats you know I got to kiss asses
still they 're busy and this and that
so yeah yeah I 've gotten lucky there .
So we 're going to open with a guy named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burt Yores</ENAMEX> trumpet player from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX> very good player and arranger
I bought one of his arrangements
it 's a beautiful arrangement
%uh and %uh different soloists
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Peezie</ENAMEX> 's coming <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</ENAMEX> after tha-
yeah
I I I worked with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX> the other night
and he said he was going to that
yeah
You did
did he say anything about coming here ?
yeah
we talked about it .
What did he say ?
%mm well he sent you a letter too
yeah
he 's looking forward to it
he 's got <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen days</ENAMEX> total .
Well I am
%huh ?
He 's only got <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen days</ENAMEX> total
but %uh
yeah ,
does he play mostly soprano or what ?
He 's plays everything .
He plays alto and %eh
Well yeah
because see every time I have a soloist like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conti</ENAMEX> and with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Mariano</ENAMEX> I figure out which arrangements they 're going to play on
and I write out all their chords and where to come in and everything --
mhm .
-- and I send them a cassette so that when they get here you know
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conti</ENAMEX> we did n't even have time for a re- one rehearsal not even
mhm
With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX> we did
so this helps a lot .
You want to kn- you want me to ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX> what he 's going to be playing ?
%uh well %uh did you say he wrote me a letter ?
yeah .
Because I 'm I 'm getting %uh ready to contact him
I 've been so damn busy man
and right now I 'm %uh working on music now
yeah
if you happen to see him ask him if he prefers soprano or alto or okay because that way I have to know what key to write the solos in
yeah okay
I 'll ask him nex-
because we 're working together on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX>
so .
That 's a coincidence anyhow
tell him I 'm going to contact him soon .
okay .
And I 'll be sending him of course eventually %uh soon I do n't want to leave it to the last minute the titles he 'll play on the cassette and the chords for all the solos
Wow .
So %uh <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October ninth</ENAMEX> we have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burt Yores</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October twenty - third</ENAMEX> I think that 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks later</ENAMEX> we have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Peezie</ENAMEX> on %uh <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November third</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Schvala</ENAMEX>

Really .

He went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L A</ENAMEX> and made a recording there
