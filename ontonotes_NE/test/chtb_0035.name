This reporter learned that , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tianjin</ENAMEX> 's export trade volume to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 million US dollars</ENAMEX> , imports were <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 20 million US dollars</ENAMEX> , with export volume growing by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 80 percent</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</ENAMEX> .

The amount of foreign investment from the other side is <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately 10 million US dollars</ENAMEX> .
The bilateral economy and trade relations are developing steadily .
According to general understanding , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tianjin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> are interlinked with convenient express air , sea , and land ports , and have historically had substantive barter trade and economic trade co-operation .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</ENAMEX> , with the development and change in the economy of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Russian Federation</ENAMEX> , general methods of bilateral trade have already gradually replaced barter trade , and trading volume has steadily increased .
At present , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Binhai International Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tianjin</ENAMEX> has become the largest airport in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Community of Independent States</ENAMEX> countries ' air freighters in terms of the number of flights and the amount of products transported for export from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .

As <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> 's domestic need for industrial products develops towards medium and advanced levels and its domestic economic situation stabilizes , many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tianjin</ENAMEX> " triple - funded enterprises " are actively seeking to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> market .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of last year</ENAMEX> , some large - scale professional foreign trade companies started to send sales teams , exhibition sale delegations , etc. , to enter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> to seek to expand business .
Relevant people who analyzed , believe that with the promotion of economic and trade relations between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> governments , the prospects of trade , investment , labor service exchange activities , etc. , between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tianjin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Russian Commonwealth</ENAMEX> look good .
