And finally <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> , with interest and curiosity .
While we may have our own problems here with a roller coaster of an election , they 've got some flip - flopping of their own going on when it comes to their national anthem .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Gizbert</ENAMEX> reports .
In a country that shed most symbols of its authoritarian past <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">almost a decade ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of them is coming out of retirement -- the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> anthem .
It was always a bold , stirring melody , a feature of the military parades in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Red Square</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Westerners</ENAMEX> came to recognize through medal ceremonies at <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Olympic Games</ENAMEX> , but , like most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> symbols , it had to go .
`` we should bury it forever , '' this man says .
`` Our citizens were massacred to the sound of that anthem , and we were deprived of our freedom . ''
So <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Yeltsin</ENAMEX> , who throughout his presidency displayed an interest in , if not a sophistication for , music , got rid of it .
He replaced it with a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">century</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> composition -- 7777 -- an instrumental with no lyrics to offend anyone , and that 's part of the problem .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> athletes were uncomfortably mute when their new lyric-less anthem was played .
Some even complained that it hurt team morale .
Ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> have difficulty humming the tune -- humming dissonantly -- not like the old anthem , 7777 humming melodically and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Yeltsin 's</ENAMEX> successor , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Putin</ENAMEX> was clearly not a fan .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Soviet - era</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KGB</ENAMEX> agent , wanted to revive the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> anthem .
He wants to present this idea of a strong state in symbols , in the flag , in the national anthem , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> realized that the anthem 's old <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="4">pro-Communist</ENAMEX> lyrics would n't resonate in the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> .
So <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this past week</ENAMEX> parliament approved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> 's compromise proposal , bring the melody of the old anthem back and come up with some new words .
Agreeing on those new words will not be easy , in a country that often can not escape or does not want to escape its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> past .
