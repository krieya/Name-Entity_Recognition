DISASTER STATES are n't jumping to raise taxes for relief and recovery .
Not yet , anyway .
Just after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> battered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> , some officials talked of perhaps adding <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a penny</ENAMEX> to the state gasoline tax or raising property taxes .
Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campbell</ENAMEX> responded , `` They 're mentioning rope when there 's been a hanging in the family . ''
A spokesman says the governor believes he can avoid increases by relying on federal aid and shifting funds in state programs .
Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX> 's impact may revive unsuccessful proposals to give local governments authority to levy sales taxes .
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX> has n't prompted proposals for state or local increases .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , where earthquake damage may top <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion</ENAMEX> , plans a special legislative session .
Property - tax relief is likely .
Legislators are talking about temporary rises in sales or gasoline taxes , although Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deukmejian</ENAMEX> says they should be a last resort .
Needs are n't clear , and the state constitution makes increasing taxes and spending very difficult .
But some legislators think the time may be ripe to revise the constitution .
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> WILL PAY if its error burdens you with bank charges .
Policy statement <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">P - 5 - 39</ENAMEX> sets out terms .
As a result of an erroneous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> levy on a bank account , a taxpayer may incur administrative and overdraft charges .
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> admits its error and the charges have been paid , it will reimburse a taxpayer who has n't refused to give timely answers to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> inquiries or has n't contributed to continuing or compounding the error .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> recently amended the policy to cover stop - payment charges for checks lost by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> .
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> asks for and gets a replacement for a check that it concedes it lost in processing , it will reimburse the taxpayer for the stop - payment charge on the original .
Reimbursement claims must be filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> district or service - center director within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</ENAMEX> after the expense accrues .
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> seeks late - payment interest because of the lost check , you should request interest abatement , publisher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prentice Hall</ENAMEX> notes .
JUST <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">FIVE ACRES MORE</ENAMEX> are all we need to feel really at home , they say .
A couple we 'll call the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blandings</ENAMEX> spent <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 800,000</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 - acre</ENAMEX> plot and main home and have an old $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">175,000</ENAMEX> mortgage exempt from the new limit on mortgage - interest deductions .
They plan to expand the home site by buying <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five adjoining acres</ENAMEX> for $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">200,000</ENAMEX> , borrowed against a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> mortgage on <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the five acres</ENAMEX> and also collateralized by <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the 15 acres</ENAMEX> .
Their debt will be well under the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</ENAMEX> limit -- on borrowing to acquire , build , or improve a home -- that qualifies for mortgage - interest deductions .
As you can guess , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blandings</ENAMEX> want to deduct home - mortgage interest on the $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">200,000</ENAMEX> loan .
But , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> private ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8940061</ENAMEX> notes , no rule or court case bears directly on the issue of adding land to a principal residence .
So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> has drawn a rationale from the sale of a home site split in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> and sold in different <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> to the same buyer ; a court let the seller in that old case treat this as the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> residence .
Thus , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> says , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blandings</ENAMEX> ' $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">200,000</ENAMEX> loan is home - acquisition debt , and interest on it is fully deductible .
EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS facing imminent filing and payment deadlines will get extensions and penalty waivers like those provided for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX> 's victims ; <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IRS Notice 89108</ENAMEX> has details .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice 89 - 107</ENAMEX> offers added relief for hurricane - hit concerns that must file pension and benefit - plan returns .
REPORTS OF PAYMENTS to independent contractors for services must be filed by businesses , but do n't bet that contractors ' unreported income will be detected that way .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> estimates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> audits do n't spot companies that fail to file the reports .
UH HUH :
A claim by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Testa</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> that a stranger paid him $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">500</ENAMEX> to go into a bank and change $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">44,400</ENAMEX> in small bills into large bills `` is unconvincing , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Tax Court</ENAMEX> found .
It held that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Testa</ENAMEX> is taxable on $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">44,400</ENAMEX> of unreported income .
WHY BE A MIDDLEMAN for charitable gifts ? a retiree asks .
A retired electrical engineer we 'll call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX> works part - time as a consultant , but he does n't want to earn so much that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> reduces his benefits .
So he has arranged for a university foundation to set up a scholarship fund for undergraduate engineering students .
He plans to tell clients to pay certain fees directly to the foundation instead of to him ; he would omit those fees from income reported on his return .
So he asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> if the plan would work .
Well , notes <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IRS private ruling 8934014</ENAMEX> , `` a fundamental principle '' is that income must be taxed to whoever earns it .
The rule goes back at least as far as a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1930</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decision , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Willens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> says .
If you assign your income to another , you still have controlled its disposition and enjoyed the fruits of your labor , even if indirectly .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX> earns any fees sent directly to charity and is taxable on them , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> says ; of course , he also may take a charitable deduction for them .
BRIEFS :
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ways and Means</ENAMEX> veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gephardt</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mo .</ENAMEX> -RRB- moves to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House Budget Committee</ENAMEX> ; Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardin</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Md .</ENAMEX> -RRB- replaces him ... .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> 's license fees for adult peep shows vary from those for other coin - operated amusements without serving a substantial government interest and are unconstitutional , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</ENAMEX> - circuit appeals court holds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Acorn Investments Inc</ENAMEX> .
