News of victory came again from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Qinghai Oil Field</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the New Year</ENAMEX> : by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of December of 97</ENAMEX> , oil output reached <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.6 million tons</ENAMEX> .
This oil field 's oil output has exceeded <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 million tons</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">7 years in a row</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">The Qinhai Oil Field</ENAMEX> is located in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Chaidamu Basin</ENAMEX> in the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Qingzang Plateau</ENAMEX> , with a total area of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 square kilometers</ENAMEX> .
Since being prospecting and explored in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 15.5 million tons</ENAMEX> of crude oil have been produced , and <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">almost 8 million tons</ENAMEX> of crude oil have been processed .
According to presentations , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , the oil field 's dynamics of exploration , development and investment in oil resources has been strengthened , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly one billion yuan</ENAMEX> of exploration funds has been invested , and prospected oil reserves have annually increased by <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 40 million tons</ENAMEX> on average .
Through measurements and calculations of new exploration data , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 4.2 billion tons</ENAMEX> of oil resources in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Chaidamu Basin</ENAMEX> have been confirmed .
Currently , proven oil reserves of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</ENAMEX> oil fields are <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 200 million tons</ENAMEX> , and natural gas is <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 150 billion cubic meters</ENAMEX> .
This scale is only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sichuan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanganning</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tarim</ENAMEX> , claiming the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> place of all gas fields in the whole country .
It was learned that , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> has planned to take advantage of the rich oil gas resources in this area during the " <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year</ENAMEX> plan " -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996 to 2000</ENAMEX> -RRB- , through methods such as introducing foreign investment , jointly raising funds with the locality , etc. to build a large - scale combination project of the natural gas industry and the salt industry , which will be capable of producing <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">120,000 tons</ENAMEX> of PVC , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100,000 tons</ENAMEX> of caustic soda , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200,000 tons</ENAMEX> of synthetic ammonia , and <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300,000 tons</ENAMEX> of carbamide .
Currently , the supplementary construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> gas pipes <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 300 kilometers</ENAMEX> in total length and a natural gas power station with a capacity of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 kilowatts</ENAMEX> have been completed and put into production .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">280 kilometer</ENAMEX> long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> natural gas pipe leading through the residential and scientific research base of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Qinghai Petroleum Bureau</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gansu</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dunhuang</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ge'ermu</ENAMEX> oil refinery with an annual production capacity of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100,000 tons</ENAMEX> of carbinol will break ground and start construction <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
Moreover , in order to improving the added value of oil products , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> phase project of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Qinghai Petroleum Bureau 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ge'ermu</ENAMEX> oil refinery , with a total investment of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">260 million yuan</ENAMEX> , has been completed and put into production .
The project mainly consists of the catalysis and reconditioning of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL"># 90</ENAMEX> unleaded gasoline with an annual output of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150,000 tons</ENAMEX> and a hydrogenation diesel oil unit with an annual output of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150,000 tons</ENAMEX> .
