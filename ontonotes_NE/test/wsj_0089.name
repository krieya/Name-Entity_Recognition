The art of change - ringing is peculiar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">English</ENAMEX> , and , like most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">English</ENAMEX> peculiarities , unintelligible to the rest of the world .

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ASLACTON</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
-- Of all scenes that evoke rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> , this is one of the loveliest : An ancient stone church stands amid the fields , the sound of bells cascading from its tower , calling the faithful to evensong .
The parishioners of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">St. Michael and All Angels</ENAMEX> stop to chat at the church door , as members here always have .
In the tower , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> bells that first sounded here in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1614</ENAMEX> .
But there is also a discordant , modern note in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aslacton</ENAMEX> , though it ca n't be heard by the church - goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</ENAMEX> .
Like most of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</ENAMEX> churches in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> with sets of bells , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">St. Michael</ENAMEX> once had its own `` band '' of ringers , who would herald every <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</ENAMEX> service .
Now , only one local ringer remains : <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">64 - year - old</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek Hammond</ENAMEX> .
The others here <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> live elsewhere .
They belong to a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> ringers -- including two octogenarians and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> youngsters in training -- who drive every <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> from church to church in a sometimes - exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Anglia</ENAMEX> .
`` To ring for even <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> service at this tower , we have to scrape , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammond</ENAMEX> , a retired water - authority worker .
`` We 've tried to train the youngsters , but they have their discos and their dances , and they just drift away . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammond</ENAMEX> worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East Anglian</ENAMEX> group that keeps the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aslacton</ENAMEX> bells pealing .
History , after all , is not on his side .
According to a nationwide survey taken <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly a third</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> 's church bells are no longer rung on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</ENAMEX> because there is no one to ring them .
It is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes .
The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells , as do the carillons of continental <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , is considered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">English</ENAMEX> to be childish , fit only for foreigners .
Change - ringing , a mind - boggling exercise the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">English</ENAMEX> invented <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">380 years ago</ENAMEX> , requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration .
Proper <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">English</ENAMEX> bells are started off in `` rounds , '' from the highest - pitched bell to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using , in larger churches , as many as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> bells .
Then , at a signal , the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking .
Each variation , or change , can occur only once , the rules state .
Ringers memorize patterns of changes , known as `` methods , '' which have odd - sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters .
A series of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</ENAMEX> or so changes is a `` peal '' and takes <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">about three hours</ENAMEX> .
A look at a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> practice at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">St. Mary Abbot</ENAMEX> church in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kensington</ENAMEX> district of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> gives an idea of the work involved .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</ENAMEX> shirt - sleeved ringers stand in a circle , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> foot ahead of the other in a prize - fighter 's stance , each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber .
No one speaks , and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling .
Totally absorbed , the ringers stare straight ahead , using peripheral vision -LRB- they call it `` rope - sight '' -RRB- to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls .
Far above in the belfry , the huge bronze bells , mounted on wheels , swing madly through a full <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">360 degrees</ENAMEX> , starting and ending , surprisingly , in the inverted , or mouth - up position .
Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing , so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change .
In a well - known detective - story involving church bells , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">English</ENAMEX> novelist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy L. Sayers</ENAMEX> described ringing as a `` passion -LCB- that -RCB- finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection . ''
Ringers , she added , are `` filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed . ''
`` Ringing does become a bit of an obsession , '' admits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephanie Pattenden</ENAMEX> , master of the band at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">St. Mary Abbot</ENAMEX> and one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> 's best female ringers .
It is a passion that usually stays in the tower , however .
More often than not , ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry .
When their changes are completed , and after they have worked up a sweat , ringers often skip off to the local pub , leaving worship for others below .
This does not sit well with some clerics .
With membership of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Church of England</ENAMEX> steadily dwindling , strong - willed vicars are pressing equally strong - willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years ago</ENAMEX> , the Rev. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremy Hummerstone</ENAMEX> , vicar of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Torrington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Devon</ENAMEX> , got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he sacked the entire band ; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest .
`` They were a self - perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises , '' the Vicar <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hummerstone</ENAMEX> says .
An entirely new band rings <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Torrington</ENAMEX> , several of whom are members of the congregation .
But there still are n't enough ringers to ring more than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> bells .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">St. Mary 's Church</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ilminster</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somerset</ENAMEX> , the bells have fallen silent following a dust - up over church attendance .
The vicar , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.D. Jones</ENAMEX> , refuses to talk about it , saying it would `` reopen the wound . ''
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.J.B. Marshall</ENAMEX> , vicar of a nearby church , feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar .
`` So crunch , crunch , crunch , bang , bang , bang -- here come the ringers from above , making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer , '' he says .
Vicar <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> admits to mixed feelings about this issue , since he is both a vicar and an active bell - ringer himself .
`` The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church , '' he says .
`` I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers</ENAMEX> , a sort of parliament of ringing groups , aims to improve relations with vicars , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John C. Baldwin</ENAMEX> , president .
It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Bells in Your Care</ENAMEX> . ''
Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baldwin</ENAMEX> , `` We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baldwin</ENAMEX> is also attacking the greater problem : lack of ringers .
One survey says that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</ENAMEX> trained bellringers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 40,000</ENAMEX> of them still ring .
Also , ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be rung -- like in small , rural parishes and inner - city churches .
But the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baldwin</ENAMEX> .
`` Right now , we 're lucky if after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> we keep <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> new ringer out of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> , '' he adds .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male - dominated field ; <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a third</ENAMEX> of the ringers <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> are women .
They are n't accepted everywhere , however .
The oldest bell - ringing group in the country , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ancient Society of College Youths</ENAMEX> , founded in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1637</ENAMEX> , remains male - only , a fact that 's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's most prestigious churches , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">St. Paul 's Cathedral</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westminster Abbey</ENAMEX> .
This being <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> , no woman has filed an equal - opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surfaced this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</ENAMEX> in a series of letters to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Ringing World</ENAMEX> , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> newspaper for ringers .
One writer , signing his letter as `` Red - blooded , balanced male , '' remarked on the `` frequency of women fainting in peals , '' and suggested that they `` settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings . ''
In the torrent of replies that followed , one woman ringer from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Solihull</ENAMEX> observed that `` the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired : badly dressed , decorated with acne and a large beer - belly , frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals . ''
Another women wrote from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sheffield</ENAMEX> to say that in her <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">60 years</ENAMEX> of ringing , `` I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry .
I have seen one or two men die , bless them .
