<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Oncor Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaithersburg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Md.</ENAMEX> , said it received approval from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> to market a genetic test that will assist in diagnosis and treatment of leukemia and lymph cancer .
The B / T gene rearrangement test is more accurate than existing tests for diagnosing the type of cancer , whether it has spread or whether there is a recurrence following treatment , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Oncor</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Turner</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX> said the test initially will be used in conjunction with biopsies and other tests , but eventually might become the benchmark for tumor analysis .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX> said the test will be shipped in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">45 days</ENAMEX> to hospitals and clinical laboratories .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyndham Wilson</ENAMEX> , a cancer treatment specialist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> , said the test is widely used in research centers but is n't having a major impact because it is only occasionally useful in choosing the most effective treatment .
But the test may prove to be more sensitive in determining whether a tumor has spread or returned following treatment , Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> said .
`` We do n't know yet how useful it 's going to be , '' he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Oncor</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - year - old</ENAMEX> developer of genetic medical tests , projects that the cancer test will help it to post its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> - ever profit during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first quarter of 1990</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX> said .
The company will charge $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">35</ENAMEX> for a test and projects <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2 million</ENAMEX> in revenue from the test during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 12 months</ENAMEX> of marketing , he said .
