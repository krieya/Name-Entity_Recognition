<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Xinhua News Agency</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1st</ENAMEX> , by wire -LRB- reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fengzhen Huang</ENAMEX> -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">" Chrysanthemum - 6 "</ENAMEX> , a large scientific experiment satellite launched by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , has no hope of entering geosynchronous orbit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yutaka Kawashima</ENAMEX> , chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Science and Technology Department</ENAMEX> , while proclaiming this news of failure to numerous journalists <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , expressed her profound regrets and apologized to the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> people .
She said that " a huge amount in appropriations was spent for research and development on the satellite , yet it has become floatsam floating in the universe ; but we still hope that this satellite can be utilized to the largest extent . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yutaka Kawashima</ENAMEX> also suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Universe Development Undertaking Group</ENAMEX> organize an inspection team to thoroughly ascertain the reason why the satellite could not enter geosynchronous orbit .
According to preliminary investigations by concerned parties , the cause of the failure was that the satellite 's apogee engine was unable to normally operate because of a breakdown in the fuel valve .
After the " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chrysanthemum - 6</ENAMEX> " satellite was sent into elliptical orbit by an " H2 - 2 " rocket on <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon of August 28th</ENAMEX> , it was originally planned to send it into geosynchronous orbit gradually by firing the satellite 's apogee engine <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</ENAMEX> times , this interval requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">around 1 month 's time</ENAMEX> .
However , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Universe Development Undertaking Group</ENAMEX> , which took responsibility for the launch , continued to remotely control the satellite on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August 30th and 31st</ENAMEX> many times but suffered repeated failures .
The " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chrysanthemum - 6</ENAMEX> " satellite , weighing <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 tons</ENAMEX> and with a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 - meter - long</ENAMEX> board of solar powered batteries , is the biggest satellite ever launched by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> so far .
Moreover , this satellite is equipped with necessary electrical machinery and sensors .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> originally planned to use it to conduct the world 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> multimedia communication experiments , such as optical communication , etc .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Universe Development Undertaking Group</ENAMEX> believed that if this satellite 's experiment was successful , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> would henceforth enter an age of using large satellites like advanced countries in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> .
Therefore , a sum of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">41.5 billion yen</ENAMEX> was put into the development of this satellite .
This time completely and greatly delayed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Universe Development Undertaking</ENAMEX> process , and many programs need to be changed .
