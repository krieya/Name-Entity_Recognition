When last we left him , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> Agent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nick Mancuso</ENAMEX> had solved a murder mystery , unraveled a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> political scandal , and racked up some pretty good ratings numbers in the miniseries `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Favorite Son</ENAMEX> . ''
What next for the crusty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> agent with the heart of gold ?
A spinoff series , of course .
There are plenty of worse inspirations for shows -- and most of them had already made the fall lineup :
a nun raising some lovable orphans .
A den mother raising some lovable teen models .
A bunch of tans and bathing suits posing as lovable lifeguards .
In that context , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Loggia 's</ENAMEX> riveting performance as the unlovable -- even crotchety -- veteran agent seems a better franchise for a series than most .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Week</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> on `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mancuso FBI</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Fridays</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10 p.m . ET</ENAMEX> -RRB- , he pokes around the crime styles of the rich , famous and powerful of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> scene -- a loose cannon on deck at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few weeks</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mancuso FBI</ENAMEX> '' has sprung straight from the headlines , which is either a commendable stab at topicality , or a lack of imagination , or both .
The opening show featured a secretary of defense designate accused of womanizing -LRB- a la <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Tower</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
When his secretary is found floating dead in the pol 's pool , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> is called in to investigate .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> , a young black girl claimed she had been raped by a white police officer -LRB- a la <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tawana Brawley</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
In this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> 's show , there 's an unsafe nuclear weaponsmaking facility -LRB- a la <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rocky Flats</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Along the way , we 're introduced to the supporting cast : a blond bombshell secretary -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randi Brazen</ENAMEX> -- her real name , honest -RRB- , a scheming young boss -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fredric Lehne</ENAMEX> -RRB- , another blonde bombshell who 's also an idealistic lawyer -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindsay Frost</ENAMEX> -RRB- , and a forensics expert -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Siebert</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
If all of this seems a little stale , it 's redeemed in part by some tricky plot twists :
The usual suspects are found to be guilty , then not guilty , then guilty -- but of a different crime .
-LRB- In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week 's</ENAMEX> rape case , for example , the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest , and the biggest villains are the politicians who exploit the case . -RRB-
Most of all though , the show is redeemed by the character of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> .
What makes the veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> man so endearing is his hard - bitten cynicism -- earned , we discover , when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</ENAMEX> .
He was n't protecting the Freedom Marchers ; he was tailing them as subversives .
This is not the `` Mississippi Burning '' scenario that thrills his young colleagues : `` Kid , you 've been reading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Classic Comics</ENAMEX> too long , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> says .
`` Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> black agents .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> were chauffeurs for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Edgar Hoover</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> cleaned his house . ''
At the core of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loggia</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> is his world - weary truculence .
He describes a reporter as `` Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> . ''
He describes a drowned corpse as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Esther Williams</ENAMEX> . ''
And when he 's told `` Try a little tenderness , '' he shoots back `` I 'm going home to try a little linguine . ''
Yet for all his cynicism , he 's at heart a closet idealist , a softy with a secret crush on truth , justice and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> Way .
He 's the kind of guy who rescues trampled flags .
If `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mancuso FBI</ENAMEX> '' has an intriguing central character , it also has a major flaw :
It 's wildly overwritten .
Executive Producers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Sohmer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Bleckner</ENAMEX> -LRB- and writer / producers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Solarz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Bello</ENAMEX> -RRB- have revved this show up to the breaking point .
To start , there 's always a crisis -- and someone always worries , `` What if the press gets a hold of this ? ''
At least once an episode we see protestors marching around screaming slogans .
At least once <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> 's boss yells `` In here -- now , '' and proceeds to dress his investigator down :
`` You are a dinosaur ... a hangover in a $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</ENAMEX> suit ...
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> more word and you are out on a park bench , mister . ''
Finally , of course , the boss gives in , but he 's still yelling : `` I find myself explaining anything to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Kennedy</ENAMEX> , you 'll be chasing stolen cars in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Anchorage</ENAMEX> . ''
In fact , throughout `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mancuso FBI</ENAMEX> , '' we do n't get words or lines -- we get speeches .
Witnesses shout , scream , pontificate : `` ... a dream that the planet could be saved from itself and from the sadistic dumb creatures who try to tear down every decent man who raises his voice . ''
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> himself is investigating at the top of his lungs : `` How the hell can you live with yourself ? '' he erupts at a politician .
`` You twist people 's trust .
You built your career on prejudice and hate .
The scars will be here <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> after the polls close . ''
In each show , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> gets to unleash similar harangues :
`` Where the hell are they gon na live when people like you turn the world into a big toxic waste dump ?
You 're the real criminal here ... and what you did was n't just a murder -- it was a crime against humanity . ''
And , at least once a show , someone delivers the line `` Get off that soapbox . ''
Now that 's advice the writers should take to heart .
They have a series with a good character , some interesting , even occasionally surprising plot lines , and they 're ruining it .
Why , when a key witness disappears , does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> trash her apartment , tearing down drapes , smashing walls ?
It 's a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction , all to add more pizzazz to a script that 's already overdosing on pizzazz .
That 's not plot .
That 's not character .
That 's hyperventilating .
There is a scene at the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first week 's</ENAMEX> show where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> attends the unveiling of the memorial to his dead partner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> .
Asked to say a few words , he pulls out his crumpled piece of paper and tries to talk , but he 's too choked up to get the words out .
He bangs on the piece of paper in frustration , then turns and walks away .
It was a profoundly moving moment for series television , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Loggia 's</ENAMEX> acting resonated in the silence .
There 's a pretty good program inside all the noise of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mancuso FBI</ENAMEX> . ''
If the show 's creators could just let themselves be quiet for a little , they might just hear it .
