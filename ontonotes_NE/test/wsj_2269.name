<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Whirlpool Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benton Harbor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , said it has developed a process to recover environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons , or CFCs , that previously entered the atmosphere during in - home repair of refrigerators and freezers .
The maker of home appliances said the process , which involves the use of a multilayer plastic bag during repairs to capture the gaseous substance and transport it to a recycling center , is already in use at a number of its service centers , and will be available to all authorized repair centers by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</ENAMEX> .
Earlier repairs vented the CFCs out of the home through a hose directly into the atmosphere .
CFCs are widely used as solvents , coolants and fire suppressants .
But their use has been linked to a potentially dangerous depletion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> 's ozone layer , and a number of companies are seeking to curtail use , or at least emission , of the substance .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Whirpool</ENAMEX> said , `` We see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of CFC use in appliance manufacture .
