Title : The Story of Teeth -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Originating site : BBS Unknown Space -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thu Jan 25</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">21:38:45</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2007</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
I have kept the good habit of having my teeth cleaned ever since I knew it could claim my life if I abruptly go to clean my teeth after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> of leaving them uncleaned .
After my still upright but " left - tilting " teeth crouched in my mouth safely and soundly for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">another two years</ENAMEX> , another revolution erupted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">half a year</ENAMEX> after I graduated and found a job .
The revolution could be said a rudimentary one , which made me decide eventually to eliminate all the betrayers and heretics in one action !.
The incident was caused by a molar .
The location of the tooth was just next to the broken wisdom tooth that led to my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> visit to an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> dentist .
For some unknown reason , when I was eating the other day , the tooth suddenly ached during the meal , and it was very painful .
Unexpected I heard a " crack " while I was eating , and part of the tooth fell off !.
I could not remember eating anything hard ?!.
I rushed to the dentist , who said root canal therapy upon seeing it , your dental nerve had come out !.
I did not know what root canal meant but thought the name was quite fancy .
It was after I began to receive it that I found it really painful !.
For example killing the nerves , and dealing with the dental crown ...
I asked the dentist then why my tooth broke .
After examining my <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</ENAMEX> teeth , the dentist told me seriously that the teeth on the right side were somewhat " cross biting " due to the " parallel shift " of my teeth , such that the upper and lower right teeth were always against each other .
The wrong position had led to uneven abrasions , resulting in the broken tooth .
I asked what solutions are available ?
The dentist said " correction . "
Thus , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> after I ran away from the " brigand orthodontist , " I stepped into the orthodontist 's office again ...
