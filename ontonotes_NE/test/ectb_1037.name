What Price Public Art ?
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Wen - ting</ENAMEX> / tr. by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher MacDonald</ENAMEX> -RRB-
The art market in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> has tended to focus on oil painting and ink - and - wash , with relatively little interest in sculpture , photography , ceramics and multimedia .
However , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of millions of NT dollars</ENAMEX> have now become available for work in a range of forms , under the provisions of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> law requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least one percent</ENAMEX> of the budget for major infrastructure projects to be spent on public art .
As a result , artists from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and abroad have been scrabbling for a slice of the public art pie .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> was designated as the Year of Public Art , and the following year experimental installations went on display at nine cultural centers around the island , chosen by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Council for Cultural Affairs</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CCA</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> also saw the adoption of new measures governing the installation of such works .
As public art began to proliferate , university departments of art , environment and architecture , spurred by demand , began offering public art courses .
Golden opportunity
The development of a number of major infrastructure projects , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">MRT system</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Second Northern Freeway</ENAMEX> and the new terminal at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CKS Airport</ENAMEX> , released <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions - even hundreds of millions - of NT dollars</ENAMEX> for spending on public art , creating a golden opportunity for eager artists .
During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> works of public art were completed in line with official provisions , at a cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 40 million</ENAMEX> .
But the budget for yet - to - be - installed works is even more staggering : <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 100 million</ENAMEX> for public art at the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CKS Airport</ENAMEX> terminal alone , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 85 million</ENAMEX> for spending by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kaohsiung</ENAMEX> port authority , and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 80 million</ENAMEX> for stations along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wanhua - Panchiao</ENAMEX> branch of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">MRT network</ENAMEX> .
At a time of bleak economic prospects , public art commissions have become a beacon for artists .
No wonder some prefer to enter public art contests rather than accept the honor of selection committee membership .
The fact that the contest for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</ENAMEX> works to be placed along <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> 's " <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Tunhwa Art Corridor</ENAMEX> , " organized by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Urban Development Department</ENAMEX> , drew entries from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 130</ENAMEX> artists , shows how intense the competition can be .
And it is sculptors who have been the biggest beneficiaries of the new policies , since <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> - dimensional art is the most suitable form for installation in open spaces : of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</ENAMEX> public art works completed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</ENAMEX> were works of sculpture .
Art engineering ?
At present , public art is chosen through <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> methods : open competition , invitation to tender , commissioning , and direct purchase .
The process has to involve a selection committee from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CCA</ENAMEX> or relevant cultural department at the local level , comprising artists , architects , landscape designers , art educationalists and so on .
The committee appraises works for artistic quality , suitability for the location , safety and feasibility .
Entries which pass the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> round are presented for public demonstration and discussion among the community , so as to avoid subsequent protests .
Unlike those working with other forms of art , the creators of public art need to have a grasp of architectural structure , environmental scenery and even accounting procedure .
Artistic conception alone is not enough .
They will be submitting expenditure claims and dealing with issues including long - term maintenance and cleaning , and maybe utility supply .
A number of artists have thus found it helpful to pool their talents , setting up workshops geared chiefly to the production of public art .
Priceless art ?
Transparency and professionalism in the public art selection process should be beneficial to the overall art environment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang Wen - ching</ENAMEX> , a number of whose works have been successfully selected , points out that artists still have to overcome frequent misunderstandings , such as when the cost of their material
