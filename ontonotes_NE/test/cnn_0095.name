<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Week ten</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NFL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">season</ENAMEX> , and for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington Redskins</ENAMEX> uniform , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff George</ENAMEX> will get the starting nod at quarterback against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Arizona Cardinals</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brad Johnson</ENAMEX> is out because of a sprained knee ligament .
I would think where we 're at that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brad</ENAMEX> will be out of the game .
My guess is -- I mean , I 'd like him to be at least be able to dress , but I 'm not sure he 'll even be able to do that .
If we where he s and be an emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> , that would probably be the best we could hope for .
