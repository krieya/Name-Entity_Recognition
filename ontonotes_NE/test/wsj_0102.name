Beauty Takes Backseat To Safety on Bridges
EVERYONE AGREES that most of the nation 's old bridges need to be repaired or replaced .
But there 's disagreement over how to do it .
Highway officials insist the ornamental railings on older bridges are n't strong enough to prevent vehicles from crashing through .
But other people do n't want to lose the bridges ' beautiful , sometimes historic , features .
`` The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack White</ENAMEX> , a planner with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Indiana Highway Department</ENAMEX> .
He and others prefer to install railings such as the `` type F safety shape , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four - foot - high</ENAMEX> concrete slab with no openings .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richmond</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ind.</ENAMEX> , the type F railing is being used to replace arched openings on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the G Street Bridge</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garret Boone</ENAMEX> , who teaches art at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Earlham College</ENAMEX> , calls the new structure `` just an ugly bridge '' and one that blocks the view of a new park below .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hartford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Charter Oak Bridge</ENAMEX> will soon be replaced , the cast - iron medallions from its railings relegated to a park .
Compromises are possible .
Citizens in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peninsula</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , upset over changes to a bridge , negotiated a deal : The bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> of the railing will be type F , while the top <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> will have the old bridge 's floral pattern .
Similarly , highway engineers agreed to keep the old railings on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Key Bridge</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> , as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road .
Tray Bon ?
Drink Carrier Competes With Cartons
PORTING POTABLES just got easier , or so claims <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Scypher Corp.</ENAMEX> , the maker of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the Cup - Tote</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> company 's beverage carrier , meant to replace cardboard trays at concession stands and fast - food outlets , resembles the plastic loops used on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> - packs of beer , only the loops hang from a web of strings .
The new carrier can tote as many as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> cups at once .
Inventor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire Marvin</ENAMEX> says his design virtually eliminates spilling .
Lids are n't even needed .
He also claims the carrier costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers .
A few fast - food outlets are giving it a try .
The company acknowledges some problems .
A driver has to find something to hang the carrier on , so the company supplies a window hook .
While it breaks down in prolonged sunlight , it is n't recyclable .
And unlike some trays , there 's no place for food .
Spirit of Perestroika Touches Design World
AN EXCHANGE of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> designers promises change on both sides .
An exhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> design and architecture opened in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> and will travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> cities .
The show runs the gamut , from a blender to chairs to a model of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citicorp</ENAMEX> building .
The event continues into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> and includes an exchange program to swap design teachers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Carnegie - Mellon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leningrad</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mutchin Institute</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Droz</ENAMEX> , leader of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Carnegie - Mellon</ENAMEX> group , sees benefits all around .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> , who normally have few clients other than the state , will get `` exposure to a market system , '' he says .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> will learn more about making products for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Droz</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> could even help <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> designers renew their sense of purpose .
`` In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> , they kept asking us things like , ` Why do you make <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> different corkscrews , when all you need is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> good one ? ' '' he says .
`` They got us thinking maybe we should be helping <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> companies improve existing products rather than always developing new ones . ''
Seed for Jail Solution Fails to Take Root
IT 'S A <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TWO</ENAMEX> BIRDS with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> stone deal : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eggers Group</ENAMEX> architects propose using grain elevators to house prisoners .
It would ease jail overcrowding while preserving historic structures , the company says .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> state , which is seeking solutions to its prison cell shortage , says `` no . ''
Grain elevators built in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1920s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">'30s</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six - inch</ENAMEX> concrete walls and a tubular shape that would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> firm says .
Many are far enough from residential areas to pass public muster , yet close enough to permit family visits .
Besides , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eggers</ENAMEX> says , grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons -- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> famed architect compared them to the pyramids of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> .
A number of cities -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> -- have vacant grain elevators , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eggers</ENAMEX> says .
A medium - sized one in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> , it says , could be altered to house <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 1,000</ENAMEX> inmates at a lower cost than building a new prison in upstate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
A spokesman for the state , however , calls the idea `` not effective or cost efficient .
