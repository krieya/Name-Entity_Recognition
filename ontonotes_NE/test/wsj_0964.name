<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The White House</ENAMEX> has decided to push for changes in pesticide law that are designed to speed the removal of harmful chemicals from the nation 's food supply .
The proposed changes , which are scheduled to be announced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , would apply to pesticides and other substances found on fresh and processed foods , according to federal officials .
Environmental groups have been calling for faster action on dangerous pesticides and may welcome part of the proposal .
But they are already objecting to , among other things , a plan to give more weight to cost - benefit considerations in evaluating pesticides .
`` It 's a tremendous disappointment , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Hathaway</ENAMEX> , an attorney with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Natural Resources Defense Council</ENAMEX> .
`` Allowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EPA</ENAMEX> to condone continued use of a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely anathema to the environmental community . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration plans to announce a series of principles and to work with congressional leaders in writing specific legislative proposals that embody them .
The principles would give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX> increased authority and flexibility in regulating pesticides , with the aim of enabling the agency to move more quickly .
There already are proposals pending in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> to overhaul pesticide law .
Moves to accelerate the removal of dangerous pesticides gained new impetus during this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> 's Alar scare , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EPA</ENAMEX> was harshly criticized for failing to yank the possible carcinogen , a growth regulator used to make apples redder and crunchier .
The agency has since acted to remove Alar from the nation 's grocery shelves by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May 31 , 1991</ENAMEX> , and the apple industry has said that growers already have stopped using the chemical .
In addition , the principles attempt to eliminate the so - called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Delaney</ENAMEX> Paradox .
Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Delaney</ENAMEX> clause , which applies to processed food , a chemical is banned if it causes cancer in laboratory animals .
Under other laws applying to pesticide use , however , that same chemical could be allowed to be used on fresh food if it fell within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EPA</ENAMEX> 's tolerance level .
Among other changes , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> wants to :
-- Give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EPA</ENAMEX> more flexibility to declare a pesticide an imminent hazard and pull it from the marketplace .
-- Speed up the process for removing a pesticide that is n't an imminent hazard .
-- Bar states from setting more stringent tolerance levels for a pesticide once the federal government has set a standard .
-- Give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EPA</ENAMEX> added discretion to set `` negligible risk '' levels for pesticide residues in processed food .
Chemicals that exceed these risk levels would be barred , but those that fall below these levels would be allowed .
-- Allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EPA</ENAMEX> to permit the continued use of pesticides that exceed its negligible risk standard if the benefits of doing so outweigh the cost .
