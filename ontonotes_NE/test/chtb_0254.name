<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lockheed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Martin - Marietta</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> old - brand military industrial corporations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , announced merging on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 30th</ENAMEX> , forming the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> 's largest defense equipment contractor corporation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lockheed Company</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Martin Company</ENAMEX> are additional participants in the growing trend of takeovers and mergers of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> companies in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few months</ENAMEX> .
This trend has spread widely to pharmaceutical and medical instrument companies , telecommunication and high - tech companies as well as retail , banks and railway companies , etc .
According to the statistics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">" Time " magazine</ENAMEX> , from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January to July this year</ENAMEX> , the asset value of takeovers announced by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> companies was as high as <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">171.6 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> increasing by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the same period last year</ENAMEX> .
Within that , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 7 months of this year</ENAMEX> , takeovers and mergers in total announced by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> industries , medical treatment , media , telecommunications and banking , reached <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1062</ENAMEX> , accounting for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one fourth</ENAMEX> of all takeovers .
Regardless of whether it is the number of takeover companies or the value of takeover assets , both exceeded or were close to the peak of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> company takeovers in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the late '80's</ENAMEX> .
Observers here hold that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">since 1994</ENAMEX> , reasons for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> company takeover trend differ from those of the past .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Firstly</ENAMEX> , the general trend of globalization of the world economy compels companies to expand scale and combine businesses , increase their overall competitive strength and to reduce costs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> government 's thoughts and actions in constructing the information highway , adjusting the financial industry and reforming the medical insurance system compels related companies to make strategic adjustments .
Moreover , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House 's</ENAMEX> attitude towards anti-trust laws is somewhat more relaxed than before .
Taking the pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies as an example , reforms of hospitals expanding scales of purchasing medicine and medical treatment equipment , and thus reducing unit costs and expanding services , have spread throughout the country .
That <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Columbia Medical Company</ENAMEX> purchased <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> hospital groups <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">within one month last year</ENAMEX> , thus integrating pharmaceuticals , medical treatment and sales , is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> such example .
For telecommunications companies , the merger of telephone companies with cable TV and wireless communications companies frequently is to mutually complement one another in operations and to dominate the market .
Recently , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> passed an inter-state banking law , allowing regional banks to operate in other states .
Handholding among banks is also to reduce overlapping services so as to reduce costs , to strengthen base assets , and expand credit scales .
For military industry enterprises , the merger of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lockheed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Martin</ENAMEX> and the combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> old - brand corporations , namely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Northrop</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grumman</ENAMEX> , are both due to the same reason : after the cold war , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's national defense expenditures gradually reduced , and the scale and strength of military industry enterprises is one of the conditions necessary for winning limited government weapons purchasing contracts .
Observers here believe that company takeovers has a positive aspect , i.e. , the reduction of cost , the increase in efficiency , and the strengthening of competitive power .
But , many takeovers are obviously actions that must be taken for companies to survive .
However , history has proven that " big and complete " monopolies of production and sales is not beneficial to the national economy 's healthy development .
For instance , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the '70's</ENAMEX> , mergers of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> steel mills directly led to the birth of a few large - scale unified steel companies , but these companies also faced serious threats from small - scale steel mills , which are flexible in operation and advanced in technology .
Moreover , company takeovers have had bad effects on consumers in terms of product quality and price , and at the same time on workers ' employment .
While voice has been given to the opinion that small enterprises are the new forces of economic growth , scaled operation of big corporations will constantly face new difficulties .
