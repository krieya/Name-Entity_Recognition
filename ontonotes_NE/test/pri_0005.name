<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two months ago</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kursk</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> nuclear submarine went down in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Barents Sea</ENAMEX> during military exercises .
All <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118</ENAMEX> sailors died .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> officials say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kursk</ENAMEX> may have sunk after a torpedo misfire but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> authorities are still investigating .
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> people are skeptical about the inquiry and about the wisdom of trying to recover the remains of the seamen , an operation said to begin in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about 2 weeks</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">World</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nenad Chebeck</ENAMEX> reports from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> .
The tragedy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kursk</ENAMEX> submarine has disappeared from the front pages but is anything but forgotten in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</ENAMEX> , in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian Orthodox</ENAMEX> tradition , a remembrance class was held <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">40 days</ENAMEX> after the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118</ENAMEX> seamen aboard the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kursk</ENAMEX> .
All over the country bearded priests spread out a roll call of the crewmembers , but even the clouds of incense could not hide the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> main controversies following the accident - what caused it and what to do with the submarine and the bodies of the crew .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Putin</ENAMEX> promised the families that the bodies will be recovered and Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gay Evanell</ENAMEX> , the head of the powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Security Council</ENAMEX> says the promise still stands .
We are going to see through this unique operation .
No one has ever done anything like it before , and we do realize that it is very risky , both when it comes to physical dangers for the divers , and to the psychological stress depending on what we find there .
But not everyone thinks recovering the bodies is a good idea .
Naval Captain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biltera Pedro</ENAMEX> says it 's against tradition that sailors have respected for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</ENAMEX> and could also cause great grief .
He says , `` just imagine the tragedy of those families when some bodies are retrieved and others are n't . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> had a similar case way back in 1970s says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</ENAMEX> body was recovered .
The Fleet Commander then decided to have even that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> body handed back to the sea where the submarine went down says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro</ENAMEX> .
And it 's not just about the tradition in the past , but the future as well argues <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexe Budnev</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Veterans Club</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Russian Fleet</ENAMEX> .
The cost of this operation will be huge .
I think it would be much better to invest the sum in improving the rescue capabilities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> fleet , so we can save lives in the future .
And while this controversy is going on , so does the government investigation into the causes of the disaster .
Former submarine captain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ureg Gladkovich</ENAMEX> says that he is confident the government commission will do a good job .
The authorities need to know the truth in order to make whatever changes are necessary for the future safety of the submarine fleet says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gladkovich</ENAMEX> , but whether those findings will ever reach the public is another matter .
Just look back at the way they fudged and lied their way through the rescue operation .
They never gave us the full truth .
That gives us reason to doubt their good intentions to tell us the truth this time .
It all depends on the good will of the military and the government .
Unfortunately , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> does n't have a political mechanism that would make such an investigation open to the public .
Military affairs analyst with the well - respected <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> news magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Itogi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Gulls</ENAMEX> , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Commission</ENAMEX> 's work is just a smoke screen .
He says the cause of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kursk</ENAMEX> tragedy is known to those in charge .
Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> commanders they know pretty well and all that 's going on now points that these people want to hide the real thing that had had happened onboard of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kursk</ENAMEX> .
But what did cause the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kursk</ENAMEX> tragedy ?
There are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> main theories .
Firstly , that a torpedo missile misfired while still in the tube causing a massive explosion in the armory , secondly , that the sub hit a mine leftover from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> , and thirdly , a collision with another vessel .
Former Captain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ureg Gladkovich</ENAMEX> says that his experience leads into believing another theory .
I believe that the captain over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kursk</ENAMEX> took a sudden and drastic maneuver to avoid colliding with another vessel .
The waters were shallow for such a huge submarine and the sub maneuver led to the front part of the sub hitting the seabed with great speed .
The sheer force led to the explosion of the armaments that are stored in the front compartment .
The whole front part of the submarine was probably flooded within <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</ENAMEX> killing most of the crew says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gladkovich</ENAMEX> .
The ones in the back compartments could have survived for a while , he says , but not more than <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</ENAMEX> , as the sea continued to flood the whole boat after it cracked up .
But while the theory sounds very plausible , there is no evidence as yet to make it anything more than educated guess work .
According to military analyst , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Gulls</ENAMEX> , that is the way things will remain .
The huge money that were promised to families avail , receive <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</ENAMEX> times more than families of soldiers who were killed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX> .
For me , it 's rather cynical attempt to shut them up .
With so many secrets linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kursk</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> 's most advanced nuclear submarine , the full truth may never emerge , even if the bodies and the boat eventually do .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The World</ENAMEX> this is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nenad Sebek</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> .
