The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> are holding technical talks about possible repayment by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 188 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="4">pre-Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> debts owed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Department</ENAMEX> said .
If the debts are repaid , it could clear the way for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> bonds to be sold in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
However , after <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> meetings with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State Department</ENAMEX> spokesman said that it 's `` too early to say '' whether that will happen .
Coincident with the talks , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Department</ENAMEX> said it has permitted a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> bank to open a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> branch .
The branch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs</ENAMEX> was approved <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last spring</ENAMEX> and opened in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> .
But a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> bank here would be crippled unless <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> found a way to settle the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 188 million</ENAMEX> debt , which was lent to the country 's short - lived democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerensky</ENAMEX> government before the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communists</ENAMEX> seized power in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</ENAMEX> .
Under a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</ENAMEX> law , <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Johnson Debt Default Act</ENAMEX> , as amended , it 's illegal for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> to extend credit to countries in default to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government , unless they are members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">World Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> belongs to neither organization .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> has settled <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">pre-1917</ENAMEX> debts with other countries in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> at less than face value .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The State Department</ENAMEX> stressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">pre-1933</ENAMEX> debts as the key to satisfying <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Johnson Act</ENAMEX> .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> until they settle <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions of dollars</ENAMEX> in additional debt still outstanding from the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> lend - lease program .
