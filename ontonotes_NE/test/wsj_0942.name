Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's biggest trading partners gave a quick thumbs - down to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> proposal to liberalize world trade and reduce farm - product subsidies .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Geneva</ENAMEX> , where world trade talks are being held under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GATT</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Community</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> proposal `` a step backward . ''
And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's minister of agriculture , forestry and fisheries told a committee of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's parliament that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> 's proposal was impractical and that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> would continue to heavily subsidize its rice farmers .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , in a far - reaching plan submitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Geneva</ENAMEX> meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> , proposed curbing price support subsidies within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</ENAMEX> and eliminating export subsidies within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials said the plan was flexible , and was intended as a pragmatic approach for gradually removing trade - distorting subsidies .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> reacted defiantly , arguing that the proposal 's main aim is to destroy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Common Agricultural Policy</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28 billion</ENAMEX> - a - year price support program .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiation , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> said in a statement .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> officials say they are irked that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> has set a specific timetable and is insisting on the `` elimination '' of export subsides , not just reduction .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC Agriculture</ENAMEX> Commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray MacSharry</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> plan `` calls into question '' the agreement reached by world negotiators <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last April</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Geneva</ENAMEX> seeking `` substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trade</ENAMEX> Representative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jules Katz</ENAMEX> replied that the proposal was entirely consistent with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April</ENAMEX> accord .
He said he was surprised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> 's reaction , calling it `` vehement , even frenetic . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> proposal also was criticized by food - importing developing countries , who said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> made no special allowances for poor nations .
While many experts argue that food - importing nations would eventually become self - sufficient in a free - market system , the poorest nations are likely to need help in the meantime .
Ambassador <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katz</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> was open to discussing particular problems of developing countries .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> administration said its plan would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when the free - trade goals would be achieved .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> argues that its plan would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by converting certain non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with existing tariffs , then would be phased out over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</ENAMEX> .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> is strongly opposed to converting agricultural supports into tariffs .
The new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> package also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports .
It would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily .
Seeking to allay <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> concerns , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> Agriculture Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clayton Yeutter</ENAMEX> said in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> that the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> plan would n't `` put farmers out of business '' but would encourage them to `` grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> , with a population of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">320 million</ENAMEX> , has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5 million</ENAMEX> farmers , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , with a population of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 245 million</ENAMEX> , has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two million</ENAMEX> farmers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's objections to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> plan center around its desire to stay self - sufficient in rice , a staple food , even though foreign producers are far more efficient .
