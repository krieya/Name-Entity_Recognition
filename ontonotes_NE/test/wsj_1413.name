President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> wants the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> to get special treatment in coping with the across - the - board spending cuts that took effect <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> to raise to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</ENAMEX> the amount of money <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney</ENAMEX> may shift among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> 's individual programs , projects and activities , allowing him to ease the pain that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm - Rudman</ENAMEX> budget law was intended to inflict .
If the request is approved by both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> would need only permission from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> to move the money , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> budget analysts .
That would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> flexibility that no other federal agency has .
`` It 's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs , '' said Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Sasser</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenn .</ENAMEX> -RRB- of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Budget Committee</ENAMEX> , who said he would oppose the request .
`` That is n't consistent with the kind of discipline that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm - Rudman</ENAMEX> is supposed to impose , '' he said .
The president 's request did n't indicate how Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> would shift the money .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> official said the request was made to give the department `` maximum flexibility '' to deal with the cuts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Budget</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman</ENAMEX> structured the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16.1 billion</ENAMEX> spending reduction , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> of which must come from defense , to `` impose a little bit more discipline '' by applying cuts to each individual program , project or activity in the budget .
That would give agencies `` less ability ... to fudge over things , '' he told reporters .
Under the deficit - reduction law , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> 's money and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 %</ENAMEX> of other agencies ' money has been canceled .
Lawmakers are expected to try to restore the funds once a pending deficit - cutting measure has been signed into law .
