<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Early this century</ENAMEX> , diamond mining in the magnificent dunes where <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Namib Desert</ENAMEX> meets <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</ENAMEX> at the beach .
Men would crawl in the sand looking for shiny stones .
It was as easy as collecting sea shells at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malibu</ENAMEX> .
Men are still combing the beach with shovels and hand brushes , searching for that unusual glint .
But only after a fleet of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">336</ENAMEX> gargantuan earthmoving vehicles belonging to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.</ENAMEX> , the world 's diamond kingpins , do their work .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">43 million tons</ENAMEX> of desert were moved from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> dune to another to recover <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">934,242 carats</ENAMEX> , which comes to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">46 tons</ENAMEX> of sand per carat , or <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one - fifth gram</ENAMEX> .
Oh yes , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Atlantic</ENAMEX> was also pushed back <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 yards</ENAMEX> .
`` If there 's diamonds out there , we 'll get to them , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Johns</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">De Beers 's</ENAMEX> engineering manager .
Here , wedged between shifting dunes and pounding waves at the world 's most inhospitable diamond dig , lies the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">earth</ENAMEX> 's most precious jewel box .
Thanks to centuries of polishing by Mother Nature -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> in the gentle current of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Orange River</ENAMEX> that carried the stones from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa 's</ENAMEX> interior , then in the cold surf of the ocean , and finally in the coarse sands of the desert -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98 %</ENAMEX> of the diamonds uncovered are of gem quality .
While other mines might yield more carats , a higher percentage of them go to industrial use .
Since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank vault , it has been turned into one .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Months</ENAMEX> after railway worker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zacharias Lewala</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> picked up a diamond from the sand in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> colonialists who controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Namibia</ENAMEX> proclaimed a wide swath of the desert -- <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 200 miles</ENAMEX> north from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Orange River</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 miles</ENAMEX> inland from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Atlantic</ENAMEX> -- a restricted area , a designation normally reserved for military operations .
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Germans</ENAMEX> lost <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> , they lost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Namibia</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> and the diamonds to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Oppenheimer</ENAMEX> , patriarch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Anglo American Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">De Beers</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , no one gets in or out of the restricted area without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">De Beers 's</ENAMEX> stingy approval .
The mining zone has thus remained <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the most desolate places in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> .
Ghost towns dot the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Namib</ENAMEX> dunes , proving diamonds are n't forever .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oranjemund</ENAMEX> , the mine headquarters , is a lonely corporate oasis of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,000</ENAMEX> residents .
Jackals roam the streets at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> , and gemsbok , hardy antelope with long straight horns , wander in from the desert to drink from water sprinklers .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">most days</ENAMEX> , the desert 's heat and the cool of the ocean combine to create a mist like a damp rag .
The wind , stinging with sand , never seems to stop .
Still , miners from all parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Namibia</ENAMEX> as well as professional staff from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">De Beers 's</ENAMEX> head offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> keep coming .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oranjemund</ENAMEX> boasts attractions besides diamonds .
There are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> video rental shops , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> restaurants , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> cinema and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</ENAMEX> sports and recreation clubs for everything from cricket to lawn bowling .
The pride of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oranjemund</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</ENAMEX> - hole golf course -- with the largest sand trap in the world .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , when the rising <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Orange River</ENAMEX> threatened to swamp the course , the same engineers who are pushing back the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Atlantic</ENAMEX> rushed to build a wall to hold back the flood .
`` Nothing is too good for our golf course , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony George</ENAMEX> , a mining engineer .
Despite fears the mine may be partially nationalized by the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Namibian</ENAMEX> government following <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next month 's</ENAMEX> elections freeing the country from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South African</ENAMEX> control , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">De Beers</ENAMEX> engineers are working to extend the mine 's productive life for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">another 25 years</ENAMEX> , from the current estimate of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> .
Huge machines that look as though they came from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Star Wars</ENAMEX> desert - battle scene lumber among the dunes .
Mechanized vacuum cleaners probe the sand like giant anteaters ; a whirring ferris wheellike excavator , with buckets instead of seats , chews through layers of compacted sand ; tracks and conveyor belts , shuttling sand to the screening plants , criss - cross the beach .
Then there is the artifical sea wall , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">600 yards</ENAMEX> long and <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 yards</ENAMEX> thick , jutting into the ocean .
Made of sand , it receives around - the - clock maintainence against the battering waves .
When the mining in front of the wall is complete , it is moved northward .
A companion jetty that helps hold back the sea looks like a rusting junkyard .
Engineers first used concrete blocks to bolster the barrier , but the ocean tossed them aside like driftwood .
Then someone decided to try broken - down earthmoving equipment that , inexplicably , held against the waves .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> people are n't too happy when they see their equipment used like that , '' shrugs Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> .
`` They figure it 's not a very good advert . ''
Despite all these innovations , most of the diamonds are still found in the sand swept away by the men wielding shovels and brushes -- the ignominiously named `` bedrock sweepers '' who toil in the wake of the excavators .
Laboring in blue and gray overalls , they are supposed to concentrate on cleaning out crevices , and not strain their eyes looking for diamonds .
But should they spy <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> , the company will pay a bonus equal to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one - third</ENAMEX> its value .
For these workers at the bottom of the mine 's pay scale , this is usually enough to overcome the temptation to steal -- a crime that could earn them <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 15 years</ENAMEX> in jail .
Still , employees do occasionally try to smuggle out a gem or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> man wrapped several diamonds in the knot of his tie .
Another poked a hole in the heel of his shoe .
A food caterer stashed stones in the false bottom of a milk pail .
None made it past the body searches and X-rays of mine security .
