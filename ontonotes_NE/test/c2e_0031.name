Low - Cost Flying ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chunqiu Airline</ENAMEX> Experience .
vox
The country 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> civilian - operated airline is headquartered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> impression is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> name is too vulgar , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">china-sss.com</ENAMEX> , would anybody be interested in putting this company 's announcement on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Leno</ENAMEX> ?
I heard people saying the ticket prices are cheap .
Then I went online and looked ; there are A and B classes , but no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> - class cabin .
Every day a certain number of specially priced seats can be reserved only online .
The ticket prices are certainly the cheapest .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chunqiu</ENAMEX> is encouraging online booking with a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 - yuan</ENAMEX> discount , which saves on costs .
But paying online in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is extremely complicated ; that 's another story .
The baggage limit is <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 kg</ENAMEX> , but I see lots of people whose baggage are definitely over that .
I did n't see complete data online for their flight safety record .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A320</ENAMEX> model is one commonly used only on minor routes .
The planes are not as old as the same models in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the U. S.</ENAMEX>
Signs say the life vests are under the seats , but in fact under the seats it 's absolutely empty .
Someone next to me asked the flight attendant , and she was unable to answer .
A male flight attendant then said there were no life vests .
After I got back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX> I hitched a ride on a plane of the same model , and the signs said the seat padding could be used as a flotation device .
That must be correct .
On board , aside from a small bottle of water , no beverages were offered , but they were selling boxed meals , all of them with the same packaging , for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">￥28</ENAMEX> a box .
There were also soy - sauce eggs , preserved eggs , peanuts and other snacks .
I do not feel that this is a good approach on brief short - haul passenger flights .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , they have to remember the passenger 's order and seat number , collect the money -LRB- and check for counterfeits -RRB- . Then heat the meal , deliver the meal ... there 's more than just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> type of meal , and the preparation is n't always simple .
It 's all helter - skelter enough .
Many people were still eating just before the plane landed .
Plus they also enthusiastically peddle gifts to earn extra income . Such as model airplanes , dolls ...
I saw <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> person pay <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</ENAMEX> for a model airplane .
In order to reduce the number of empty seats , the plane even has passengers going to different destinations ; after the plane landed at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> , those people stayed on the plane and waited for the cabin to be cleaned and tidied , and only after new passengers were boarded did they continue on their way .
After we landed at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> , an airport bus transferred us ; they did n't use the bridge .
They said this was another cost - saving measure .
In short , the plane was on time , the baggage was delivered quickly , and the service was OK .
This kind of train - like business approach is rather unusual .
