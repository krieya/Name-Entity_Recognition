Hello again and welcome , I am <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Chadwick</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> helicopter gunships were pressed into service <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> , as gun battles with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> erupted on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the West Bank</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> and at the border crossing into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaza</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least five</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> demonstrators and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> soldiers were killed .
Both sides reported many injured .
Against that bloody backdrop , there were diplomatic efforts to call a ceasefire , but after a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX> , acting <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shlomo Ben - Ami</ENAMEX> said what 's happening is not a civilian uprising as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> claim , but a military confrontation , a mini war , as he put it .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> negotiator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sayeb Erekat</ENAMEX> is expected to meet separately with Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> Secretary General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kofi Annan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">later this week</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> , former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shimon Peres</ENAMEX> met with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat</ENAMEX> with whom he once shared <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Nobel Peace Prize</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VOA</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurie Cassman</ENAMEX> reports there apparently was no breakthrough .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> meeting lasted for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">about two hours</ENAMEX> , but neither man had any comments on the contents of the discussions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Earlier in the evening</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Barak</ENAMEX> said he was sending Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX> with a message to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> leader to end the violence now .
For his part , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> officials say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> wanted to call on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX> to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> to stop the fighting .
The meeting took place after an <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</ENAMEX> of fierce clashes between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> military and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> in several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Bank</ENAMEX> towns and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaza</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> soldiers and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least half a dozen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> policeman were killed in separate clashes .
After an emergency meeting with his security advisors <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Wednesday night</ENAMEX> , Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> warned of a tough response if the violence continues .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Army</ENAMEX> will act firmly , he says , but without being drawn into adventurism .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> media says it has been warned to evacuate its broadcasting facility .
Radio says military commanders have provided Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> with a list of targets , but his word of caution against what he calls adventurism indicates heightened <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> sensitivity to international accusations of an exaggerated use of force against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> .
Chief <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> negotiator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sayeb Erekat</ENAMEX> says he was prevented by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> security from leaving his home in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jericho</ENAMEX> because of the fighting there .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> combat helicopters are reported to have hit a hotel and casino in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jericho</ENAMEX> and a building of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Palestinian Authority</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erekat</ENAMEX> is due to travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> to meet with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> officials attempting to win a ceasefire .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> has already met with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's acting Foreign Minister .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurie Cassman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VOA News</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Amnesty International</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's military tactics exhibit a pattern of gross human rights violations that could constitute war crimes .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> - based human rights organizations says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's use of tanks and helicopters is far out of proportion to the threat posed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> stone throwers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Amnesty</ENAMEX> also criticized <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> for attacking <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> civilians and said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Palestinian Authority</ENAMEX> is not doing enough to keep children away .
