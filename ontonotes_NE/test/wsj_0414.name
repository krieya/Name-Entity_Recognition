BROKERAGE HIRING languishes amid market turmoil .
But survivors earn more .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> counts <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">under 39,000</ENAMEX> workers , down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of the year</ENAMEX> and off <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,500</ENAMEX> from after its merger and the market collapse <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> .
Another major firm has cut <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</ENAMEX> workers , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</ENAMEX> of its staff , since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Black Monday</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Bureau of Labor Statistics</ENAMEX> says securities firms in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> alone have slashed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,000</ENAMEX> jobs from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1987</ENAMEX> peak of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">163,000</ENAMEX> .
Average <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> earnings of those who have hung on , though , surged to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">78,625</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> from $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">69,553</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> .
Any hiring is confined to retail sales .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Illinois Company Investments</ENAMEX> had been trimming its ranks until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</ENAMEX> .
But then it was acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Household International Inc</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Now</ENAMEX> it offers richer commissions to lure a broker a week .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Interstate / Johnson Lane Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> adds <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</ENAMEX> people -- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</ENAMEX> of them in retail -- to its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,300</ENAMEX> - member staff .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">A.G. Edwards -AMP- Sons</ENAMEX> runs training classes and looks for experienced brokers .
`` We 're always going to hire someone we consider to be a winner , '' an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Edwards</ENAMEX> official says .
SKILLED WORKERS aplenty are available to cope with earthquake damage .
`` I do n't foresee any shortages over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few months</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Allen</ENAMEX> , an official of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Operating Engineers Local 3</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
Ironically , `` up until the quake , we desperately tried to fill jobs , '' especially for crane and bulldozer operators .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 17</ENAMEX> temblor put a halt to much nonessential building , and heavy rains <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> slowed the rest , freeing construction workers for earthquake repairs .
The supply of experienced civil engineers , though , is tighter .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> has been recruiting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> for engineers experienced in road and bridge design .
But , with the state offering <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 39,000</ENAMEX> a year and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's high standard of living , `` there are n't too many to choose from , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Scott</ENAMEX> , a recruiting officer .
He says the department now has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</ENAMEX> openings and wants to hire <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">625</ENAMEX> civil engineers over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 15 months</ENAMEX> .
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> may taketh what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Labor Department</ENAMEX> giveth .
But stay tuned .
Employee - benefit specialists drew a collective sigh of relief in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early October</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Labor Department</ENAMEX> backed away from a proposal that companies let former employees and beneficiaries -- along with active workers -- borrow against balances in 401 -LRB- k -RRB- and similar savings plans .
In an advisory letter , the department said that , starting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 18</ENAMEX> , loans could be limited to `` parties in interest , '' which generally means active workers but also includes retirees who continue as directors and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> shareholders .
Now comes word that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> regulations being drafted could put companies in violation of the tax code if they make loans to retiree shareholders and directors but do n't make them available to other former workers who usually earned less .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> says the question wo n't be settled until the regulations are issued `` shortly . ''
But violation could bring substantial tax penalties to both employer and employees .
`` It 's a severe case of regulatory whiplash , '' complains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Saveth</ENAMEX> of consultant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">A. Foster Higgins -AMP- Co</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Rumack</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Buck Consultants</ENAMEX> has asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Labor</ENAMEX> to recraft its rule to remove the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> threat .
CORPORATE DOWNSIZING digs deeper .
Outplacement consultant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Right Associates</ENAMEX> says the average pay of its clients fell to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">66,743</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> from $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">70,765</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> ; severance pay dropped to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">25 weeks</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</ENAMEX> .
Both reflect the dismissal of lower - level and shorter - tenure executives .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">FIRST</ENAMEX> TEACH THYSELF .
Executives universally believe workers should know their employer - sponsored benefits .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> managers ca n't accurately state the value of their own packages , consultant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noble Lowndes</ENAMEX> says .
MEA CULPA .
Fully <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62 %</ENAMEX> of the doctors surveyed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> think their fellow physicians are responsible for rising health - care costs , ahead of hospitals -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 %</ENAMEX> -RRB- and patients -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48 %</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
NO , YOU WORK !
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> companies with flexible benefit plans lets workers buy or sell <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">vacation days</ENAMEX> , consultant Towers Perrin says .
Employees like the option but firms say it 's too tough to run .
STUDENTS SHUN burger flipping for jobs tied to careers .
Some even study .
`` Fast - food jobs are n't popular no matter what they pay , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tufts</ENAMEX> official .
Working students , she explains , want `` some satisfaction . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">University of Michigan</ENAMEX> students look for jobs related to planned careers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Carnegie Mellon</ENAMEX> , though , says some students conclude they can help their careers most by hitting the books : `` They 're opting to build their resumes through good grades and leadership roles in fraternities . ''
Slowing economies in some areas limit student choice .
Student job postings at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boston University</ENAMEX> slip <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> following a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> .
Still , the school says there are an ample number and pay is <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $ 7.20</ENAMEX> an hour from $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.90</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
M.B.A. candidates at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> earn up to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</ENAMEX> an hour on marketing or computer projects .
THE CHECKOFF : Fiery ambition :
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hyatt Corp.</ENAMEX> hires a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">University of Wyoming</ENAMEX> graduate with degrees in geology and petroleum engineering for $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.50</ENAMEX> an hour to tend wood fires at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> ski resort ... .
Is somebody telling us something ?
