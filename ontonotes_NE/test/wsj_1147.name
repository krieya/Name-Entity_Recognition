The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> approved a short - term spending bill to keep the government operating through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 15</ENAMEX> and provide <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.85 billion</ENAMEX> in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">321</ENAMEX> - 99 roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance , but the cost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> is sure to aggravate budget pressures this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> and next under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm - Rudman</ENAMEX> deficit reduction law .
By a lopsided <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">401</ENAMEX> - 18 margin , the chamber rejected an effort to waive <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm - Rudman</ENAMEX> for purposes of addressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> disasters , and budget analysts estimate the increased appropriations will widen the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> deficit by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 1.44 billion</ENAMEX> unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> .
The budget impact will be greater still in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1991</ENAMEX> , and the issue forced a confrontation between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> leadership and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Budget Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Panetta</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> district was at the center of the earthquake <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> .
Going to the well of the chamber , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panetta</ENAMEX> demanded the costs be fully counted .
His prominent role put him in the awkward position of challenging the very committee members on whom his state will be most dependent in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the months ahead</ENAMEX> .
`` We do not come to this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> asking for any handout , '' said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> .
`` We do not intend to hide these costs from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> people . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.85 billion</ENAMEX> package incorporates <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</ENAMEX> for low - interest disaster loans , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> in highway construction funds , and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.35 billion</ENAMEX> divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters .
The funds are in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 billion</ENAMEX> appropriated <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> to assist in the recovery from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX> , bringing the total for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> disasters to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 4 billion</ENAMEX> in unanticipated spending .
Because of the vagaries of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm - Rudman</ENAMEX> , the immediate impact is relatively small .
But the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1991</ENAMEX> .
Within the appropriations process , the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those subcommittees that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget .
The underlying bill approved <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> is required to keep the government operating past <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight tonight</ENAMEX> , and this urgency has contributed to the speed -- and , critics say , mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance .
The hastily drafted measure could hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required .
And the state 's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 185 million</ENAMEX> in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
Also , the high price of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> real estate puts the state at odds with federal regulations more attuned to the national average .
For example , disaster loans , which will go to small businesses and homeowners , offer credit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as low as 4 %</ENAMEX> in some cases .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> delegation finds itself asking that the cap per household be lifted to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">500,000</ENAMEX> from $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">100,000</ENAMEX> to assist the hard hit but often wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Marina district</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> is expected to make some modifications <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , but both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> appear most anxious to speed final approval before <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> 's deadline .
Administration pressure discourages any effort to add to total funding , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> changes are expected to be largely technical -- dealing with highway aid and lifting the ceiling on total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Small Business Administration</ENAMEX> loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 billion</ENAMEX> to accommodate the increased activity expected .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> 's floor action came as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - Senate conference approved a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 8.5 billion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> military construction bill , representing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> reduction from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> and making severe cuts from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> requests for installations abroad .
<ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">An estimated $ 25.8 million</ENAMEX> is allocated to continue work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oman</ENAMEX> .
But all funding is cut for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> , and projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> are cut to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.6 million</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than a sixth</ENAMEX> of the administration 's request .
Closer to home , the negotiators were more generous .
<ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">An estimated $ 38.9 million</ENAMEX> was set aside for military installations in the home state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.G. Hefner</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> chairman .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70.2 million</ENAMEX> would go to projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> represented by his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> counterpart and fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> , Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Sasser</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> are traditionally powerful within the conference , but equally striking is the dominance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX> Byrd -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">W.Va .</ENAMEX> -RRB- even added report language listing <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 49.4 million</ENAMEX> in projects he wants in the budget <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
No individual illustrated this mix of power more <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> than Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Inouye</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> -RRB- , who chairs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> defense subcommittee .
In the final trading , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> was insistent on setting aside <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</ENAMEX> to carry out base closings ordered to begin in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> .
But it gave ground to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inouye</ENAMEX> on a number of projects , ranging from a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11 million</ENAMEX> parking garage here , to a land transfer in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> , to a provision to assist <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">the Makwah Indian Tribe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> state .
The tribe is one of the poorest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Pacific Northwest</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inouye</ENAMEX> , who chairs the select committee on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Indian Affairs</ENAMEX> , used his power to move $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">400,000</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Air Force</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bureau of Indian Affairs</ENAMEX> to assist in renovating a decommissoned base to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center .
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - Senate negotiators have tentatively agreed on a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.18 billion</ENAMEX> anti-drug and anti-crime intitiative , cutting other federal spending <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.43 %</ENAMEX> to pay for it .
A formal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - Senate conference is expected to ratify the accord <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">later this week</ENAMEX> .
