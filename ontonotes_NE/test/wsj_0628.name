Factory owners are buying new machinery at a good rate <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</ENAMEX> , machine tool makers say , but sluggish sales of new cars and trucks raise questions about <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fourth - quarter</ENAMEX> demand from the important automotive industry .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> orders for machine tools rebounded from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</ENAMEX> doldrums , but remained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.7 %</ENAMEX> below <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year - earlier</ENAMEX> levels , according to figures from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NMTBA</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Association for Manufacturing Technology</ENAMEX> .
Domestic machine tool plants received <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 303 million</ENAMEX> of orders <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 227.1 million</ENAMEX> , but still below the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 328.2 million</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1988</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NMTBA</ENAMEX> said .
Machine tools are complex machines ranging from lathes to metal - forming presses that are used to shape most metal parts .
`` Overall demand still is very respectable , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher C. Cole</ENAMEX> , group vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cincinnati Milacron Inc.</ENAMEX> , the nation 's largest machine tool producer .
`` The outlook is positive for the intermediate to long term . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> orders for all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> producers , in fact , were slightly above the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> average for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a good year</ENAMEX> for the industry .
`` Aerospace orders are very good , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> says .
`` And export business is still good .
While some automotive programs have been delayed , they have n't been canceled . ''
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> was one of the biggest order <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> in our history , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James R. Roberts</ENAMEX> , vice president , world - wide sales and marketing , for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Giddings -AMP- Lewis Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fond du Lac</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wis</ENAMEX> .
At a recent meeting of manufacturing executives , `` everybody I talked with was very positive , '' he says .
Most say they plan to spend more on factory equipment in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> .
But sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">North American</ENAMEX> - made <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> - model cars are running at an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only six million</ENAMEX> , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.1 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> .
And truck sales also are off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</ENAMEX> .
Auto makers , who began deferring some equipment purchases <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last spring</ENAMEX> , can be expected to remain cautious about spending if their sales do n't pick up , machine tool builders say .
Machine tool executives are hopeful , however , that recent developments in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> will expand markets for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - made machine tools in that region .
There is demand for state - of - the - art machine tools in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> and in other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern European</ENAMEX> countries as those nations strive to improve the efficiency of their ailing factories as well as the quality of their goods .
However , there 's a continuing dispute between machine tool makers and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Defense Department</ENAMEX> over whether sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> machine tools would increase <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union 's</ENAMEX> military might .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Commerce Department</ENAMEX> says go , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Defense Department</ENAMEX> says stop , '' complains <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> machine tool producer .
If that controversy continues , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> machine tool makers say , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> and other foreign producers are likely to grab most of the sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> orders for machining centers , lathes , milling machines , grinders , boring mills and other machines that shape metal by cutting totaled <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 192.9 million</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 266.5 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> , but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 %</ENAMEX> increase from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 156.3 million</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NMTBA</ENAMEX> said .
Orders <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> for metal - forming presses and other machinery to form metal with pressure surged to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 110.1 million</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78 %</ENAMEX> rise from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 61.7 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 %</ENAMEX> gain from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70.9 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> 's presses are large and costly machines , and a few orders can produce a high total for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</ENAMEX> that does n't necessarily indicate a trend .
Machine tool shipments <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 281.2 million</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 %</ENAMEX> rise from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</ENAMEX> increase from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> .
Shipments have run well ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</ENAMEX> , as machine tool builders produce against relatively good backlogs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> producers had a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.15 billion</ENAMEX> backlog of unfilled orders at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of September</ENAMEX> .
That was up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.8 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> , even though orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first nine months of 1989</ENAMEX> were down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</ENAMEX> from the comparable <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> period .
