Bond prices staggered in seesaw trading , rising on reports of economic weakness and falling on reports of economic strength .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds got off to a strong start , advancing modestly during overnight trading on foreign markets .
`` We saw good buying in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and excellent buying in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Goldinger</ENAMEX> , market strategist and trader at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capital Insight Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif</ENAMEX> .
The market 's tempo was helped by the dollar 's resiliency , he said .
Late in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> , the dollar was quoted at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8410 West German marks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.70 Japanese yen</ENAMEX> , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Monday</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> sterling eased to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5775</ENAMEX> from $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5825</ENAMEX> .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> trading began , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds received an additional boost from news that sales of new single - family homes fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
The contraction was twice as large as economists projected and was the sharpest decline since a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</ENAMEX> drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1982</ENAMEX> .
Economists said the report raised speculation that the economic slowdown could turn into a recession , which would pave the way for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to lower interest rates .
But later in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> , a report by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago</ENAMEX> cast doubt on the recession scenario .
The association said its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> index of economic activity rose to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51.6 %</ENAMEX> after having been <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">below 50 %</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three consecutive months</ENAMEX> .
A reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">below 50 %</ENAMEX> indicates that the manufacturing industry is slowing while a reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above 50 %</ENAMEX> suggests that the industry is expanding .
Bond prices fell after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> report was released .
By the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> , bond prices were mixed .
The benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond was nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/4</ENAMEX> point higher , or up <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2.50</ENAMEX> for each $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> face amount .
New <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> notes ended unchanged while <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - year</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - year</ENAMEX> notes were slightly lower .
Municipal bonds ended unchanged to as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</ENAMEX> point higher while mortgage - backed securities were up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1/8</ENAMEX> point .
Corporate bonds were unchanged .
In the corporate market , an expected debt offering <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> generated considerable attention .
The giant computer maker is slated to offer <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> non-callable debentures through underwriters led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salomon Brothers Inc</ENAMEX> .
Traders expect the bonds to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0.60 to 0.65</ENAMEX> percentage point above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond , which ended <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> with a yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 7.90 %</ENAMEX> .
The last time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> tapped the corporate debt market was in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1988</ENAMEX> , when it offered <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</ENAMEX> of debt securities .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> 's visits to the debt market are closely watched by treasurers at other corporations and by credit market analysts .
Some analysts believe the company has the ability to pinpoint the trough in interest - rate cycles .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1979</ENAMEX> , just <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">days</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> raised interest rates , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> offered <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> in debt securities .
The boost in rates sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> 's bonds tumbling , leaving underwriters with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</ENAMEX> of losses and triggering a sell - off in the overall market .
The company `` ca n't be bullish if they 're doing a sizable <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bullet , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> analyst .
Others said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> might increase the size of the offering to as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> if investor demand is strong .
The company has <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> in debt filed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> .
`` I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</ENAMEX> is a little bit of a fire drill , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Ednee</ENAMEX> , head of the industrial bond department at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ENAMEX> .
`` I think as the pricing time arrives , the bonds will come a little richer and in a larger amount . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> Securities
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> prices ended mixed in light trading .
The benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond was quoted late at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 12/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.90 %</ENAMEX> compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 7/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.92 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
The latest <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> notes were unchanged at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 16/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.904 %</ENAMEX> .
Short - term rates also were mixed .
The discount rate on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - month</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills rose slightly from the average rate at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> 's auction to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.79 %</ENAMEX> for a bond - equivalent yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.04 %</ENAMEX> .
The discount rate on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills fell slightly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.60 %</ENAMEX> for a bond - equivalent yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.99 %</ENAMEX> .
Corporate Issues
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> junk bond issues were priced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , including a scaled - backed offering by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Beatrice Co</ENAMEX> .
A spokesman for underwriters <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Beatrice</ENAMEX> cut its high - yield offering to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 251 million</ENAMEX> from a planned <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</ENAMEX> after it became clear the company would have to give investors higher yields .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - part offering , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 151 million</ENAMEX> of senior subordinated reset notes were priced at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99.75</ENAMEX> and carried a rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 3/4 %</ENAMEX> , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</ENAMEX> of senior subordinated floating rate notes were priced to float at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.25</ENAMEX> percentage points above the London Interbank Offered Rate , or LIBOR .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one - year</ENAMEX> LIBOR rate <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 7/16 %</ENAMEX> .
Since the recent deterioration of the junk - bond market , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</ENAMEX> other junk issuers have said they plan to scale back planned high - yield offerings , and several issues have been postponed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Carmichael</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Beatrice</ENAMEX> chief financial officer , said favorable market conditions in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> prompted the company to plan more debt than necessary .
`` However , given the changes in the market conditions that have occurred since then , we decided to sell only the amount needed to proceed with our contemplated recapitalization , '' he said .
Under the firm 's original bank credit agreement , it was required to raise <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 million</ENAMEX> of subordinated debt to be used to repay some of the bank borrowings drawn to redeem <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 526.3 million</ENAMEX> of increasing rate debentures in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A month ago</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Beatrice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> filed to sell debt , the company had planned to offer <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</ENAMEX> of its senior subordinated reset notes at a yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 3/4 %</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</ENAMEX> in senior subordinated floating - rate notes were targeted to be offered at a price to float <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> percentage points above the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - month</ENAMEX> LIBOR .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> , however , market conditions had deteriorated and the reset notes were targeted to be offered at a yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 13 1/4 % and 13 1/2 %</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carmichael</ENAMEX> said investors also demanded stricter convenants .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Continental Cablevision Inc.</ENAMEX> , via underwriters at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Morgan Stanley -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , priced <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</ENAMEX> of junk bonds at par to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 7/8 %</ENAMEX> .
Mortgage - Backed Securities
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">J.C. Penney -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> issued <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</ENAMEX> of securities backed by credit - card receivables .
The securities were priced at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99.1875</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9.19 %</ENAMEX> .
Underwriters at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">J.C. Penney</ENAMEX> credit - card securities are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> average life , which is much longer than previous such issues .
Elsewhere , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ginnie Mae 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> issue for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> delivery was quoted at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 18/32</ENAMEX> bid , up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5/32</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Monday</ENAMEX> , to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9.333 %</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">12 - year</ENAMEX> average life assumption .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Freddie Mac 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 1/2 %</ENAMEX> issue was quoted at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 20/32</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/32</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fannie Mae 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> issue was at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 7/32</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/8</ENAMEX> .
On the pricing front , an <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</ENAMEX> - class issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp</ENAMEX> .
Remic mortgage securities was launched by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> group .
The offering is backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Freddie Mac 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> issue with a weighted average term to maturity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">29.583 months</ENAMEX> .
Municipal Issues
Municipal bonds were little changed to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</ENAMEX> point higher in late dealings .
`` We were oversold and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> we bounced back .
Some accounts came in for some blocks in the secondary -LCB- market -RCB- , which we have n't seen for a while , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> trader .
`` There were no -LCB- sell -RCB- lists and the calendar is lightening up a bit .
There 's light at the end of the tunnel for municipals , '' he said , adding that he expects prices to `` inch up '' in the near term .
The market 's tone improved after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> 's pricing of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 813 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> general obligation bonds .
The issue 's smooth absorption eased fears that supply would overwhelm demand in coming sessions , traders said .
Demand for the bonds was strong enough to permit underwriters to trim some yields in the tax - exempt portion of the offering late <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - part <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75.1 million</ENAMEX> offering of wastewater treatment bonds by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New Jersey Wastewater Treatment Trust</ENAMEX> was more than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> sold by late in the session , according to lead underwriter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ENAMEX> .
The debt was reoffered priced to yield from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.15 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2008 - 2009</ENAMEX> .
Foreign Bonds
Most foreign government bonds markets were quiet .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> bonds firmed a bit after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> 's fall , but traders said the market remains bearish due to speculation that interest rates could rise again .
In a speech given <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> but released <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Monday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Schlesinger</ENAMEX> suggested that it was risky to claim that the booming <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> economy has reached the peak of its cycle .
His comments were interpreted as a sign that higher interest rates are possible .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 5</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> raised the Lombard and discount rates by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> percentage point to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</ENAMEX> , respectively , the highest levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</ENAMEX> bond due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1999</ENAMEX> was unchanged at 99.35 to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.09 %</ENAMEX> while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 3/4 %</ENAMEX> notes due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1994</ENAMEX> rose <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.025</ENAMEX> point to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97.275</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.445 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> government bonds showed little change .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's benchmark No. 111 issue due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> ended on brokers ' screens at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95.90</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</ENAMEX> point , to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.435 %</ENAMEX> .
British government bonds were little changed as investors awaited an address on economic policy by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Major</ENAMEX> , the new Chancellor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Exchequer</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 3/4 %</ENAMEX> bond due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2003 / 2007</ENAMEX> rose <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2/32</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111 1/2</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.14 %</ENAMEX> while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 3/4 %</ENAMEX> notes due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> were unchanged at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 21/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.95 %</ENAMEX> .
