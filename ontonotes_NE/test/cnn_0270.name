We turn now to an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> --
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> of all , before we tell you about this story , we were going to , these are live pictures from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> .
There 's been some activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the last few moments</ENAMEX> .
Looks like tracer fire we 're looking at , anti-aircraft guns firing at what they sense is some sort of threat coming from the skies .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> has had sporadic episodes of this <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> .
No major explosions we 're aware of , but just , apparently , in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the last few moments</ENAMEX> , there has been activity .
You can see it there just now .
We 've been reporting , the city has begun to see its electricity turned back on .
We do n't know that all of it is back , but at least some of it is .
We also know that <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 miles</ENAMEX> southwest of the city , coalition forces remain largely in control of what was formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saddam Hussein International Airport</ENAMEX> , now renamed by the coalition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Baghdad International Airport</ENAMEX> , but the coalition is quick to point out that they do not have control of the area immediately surrounding the airport .
Again , this is -- these are live pictures of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> , where it is well into <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</ENAMEX> .
We 're , of course , going to keep monitoring the situation there and bring you up to speed on anything we learn .
