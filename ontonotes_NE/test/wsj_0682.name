Federal investigators have identified the problem in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last July 's</ENAMEX> crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Airlines</ENAMEX> flight in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> : a structural flaw that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</ENAMEX> , officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> have suspected that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack that ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight .
The explosion sent shards of metal flying , severing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the DC - 10 's</ENAMEX> hydraulic or control systems , and led to the crash that killed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112</ENAMEX> people .
But investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 232 's</ENAMEX> tail engine from a cornfield near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Sioux City Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> .
The safety board will begin <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</ENAMEX> of hearings on the accident <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sioux City</ENAMEX> .
Among the issues the board will examine is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Airlines</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> , should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks .
The engine involved was <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">a CF6 - 6</ENAMEX> made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Electric Co</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Broderick</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FAA</ENAMEX> 's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance , said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw -- known as `` hard alpha '' -- occurred in the titanium during its production almost <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years ago</ENAMEX> .
He said there was n't any way to detect the flaw at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that time</ENAMEX> , and that the process has since been changed to decrease the chance that such flaws would occur .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FAA</ENAMEX> already has ordered that all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">232</ENAMEX> disks made by the old process be removed from the planes and subjected to an ultrasonic test in a water - submersion chamber .
Such tests make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FAA</ENAMEX> confident that a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sioux City</ENAMEX> - type accident `` wo n't happen again , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broderick</ENAMEX> .
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> said that the company has been working with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FAA</ENAMEX> all along on this issue and `` will comply fully with the required inspections . ''
But he also pointed out that the recalls will have no impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> 's engine production .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CF6 - 6</ENAMEX> series engines are n't being manufactured any more ; they are only being used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC - 10 Series 10</ENAMEX> planes currently in service , he said .
