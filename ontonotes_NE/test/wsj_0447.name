On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 30</ENAMEX> , a major part of our trade deficit went poof !
No figure juggling ; no witchcraft ; just vastly improved recording of some of our exports .
The result ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Commerce Department</ENAMEX> found that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> exports in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , net of imports , were understated by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.9 billion</ENAMEX> a year and understated at the annualized rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25.4 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first quarter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</ENAMEX> of the `` newly found '' net exports were from just a few service - sector categories .
Some of the biggest service - industry exporters -- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> financial - service companies , for example -- have yet to be fully included in our export statistics .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nearly 10 years ago</ENAMEX> , representatives of service - sector companies worked out a plan with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commerce Department</ENAMEX> to improve the data on service - sector exports .
Both groups believed that <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of billions of dollars</ENAMEX> of service exports -- such as inbound tourism ; legal , accounting and other professional services furnished to foreigners ; financial , engineering and construction services ; and the like -- were not being counted as exports .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> `` trade deficit '' figure is limited to traditional merchandise trade : manufactured goods and raw materials .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</ENAMEX> balance - of - payments report , those merchandise trade figures are merged with statistics on exports and imports of services , as well as returns on investments abroad by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> and returns on foreign investments in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
Over time , through benchmark surveys , the corrected data on service exports and imports have been gathered .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> . -LRB- net after expenditures by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> studying abroad -RRB- , some exports by professional firms -LRB- a law firm billing a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> client for services rendered in watching legislation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> is as much an export as shipment of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> jet engine -RRB- , and improved data from travel and tourism .
In just these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> areas , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commerce Department</ENAMEX> found <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23 billion</ENAMEX> more exports than previously reported and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.6 billion</ENAMEX> more imports , with the net result that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> service surplus in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> increased by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.3 billion</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19 billion</ENAMEX> .
Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade areas , the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> net exports that had not previously been recorded was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 20 billion</ENAMEX> a year .
That means that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade deficit was running closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 billion</ENAMEX> than to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 95 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55 billion</ENAMEX> -LRB- annualized -RRB- rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first quarter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> .
These revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</ENAMEX> .
The materially smaller trade deficit may have been already discounted in the market .
What does this mean for trade policy ?
Too early to tell , but a trade deficit that is significantly smaller than we imagined does suggest a review of our trade posture .
It does not relieve the need for our market - opening efforts for both goods and services , but it does suggest that it is our exports of services , and not just borrowing , that is financing our imports of goods .
