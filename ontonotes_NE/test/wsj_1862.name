The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American Way of Buying</ENAMEX> '' Survey consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> separate , door - to - door nationwide polls conducted for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Peter D. Hart Research Associates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Roper Organization</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> surveys , which asked different questions , were conducted using national random probability samples .
The poll conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Peter D. Hart Research Associates</ENAMEX> interviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,064</ENAMEX> adults <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">age 18 and older</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 15 to June 30 , 1989</ENAMEX> .
The poll conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Roper Organization</ENAMEX> interviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,002</ENAMEX> adults <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">age 18 and older</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July 7 to July 15 , 1989</ENAMEX> .
Responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Census</ENAMEX> data .
For each poll , the odds are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> using the same questionnaire , the findings would differ from these poll results by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than 2 1/2</ENAMEX> percentage points in either direction .
The margin of error for subgroups -- for example , married women with children at home -- would be larger .
In addition , in any survey , there is always the chance that other factors such as question wording could introduce errors into the findings .
