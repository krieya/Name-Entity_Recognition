As the citizens of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and surrounding communities began assessing the damage from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> 's devastating earthquake , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC News</ENAMEX> began assessing the damage from what some said was a failure to provide comprehensive coverage in the earthquake 's initial moments .
`` In terms of coverage , it was a disaster equal to the earthquakes , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Premner</ENAMEX> , president for broadcasting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">King Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> , which owns the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> affiliate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wash</ENAMEX> .
While rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC News</ENAMEX> outstripped the competition in live coverage of the event by sheer luck -- the network was broadcasting <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the World Series</ENAMEX> from Candlestick Park when the quake struck -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC News</ENAMEX> was unable to get its signal out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the first hour</ENAMEX> after the quake .
`` I have to attribute the lackluster performance to a natural disaster , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Premner</ENAMEX> .
`` So before I start to be really critical of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> , I would like to know more about what happened . ''
There were no complaints from affiliates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cable News Network</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Turner Broadcasting System Inc</ENAMEX> .
But that was not the case at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC News</ENAMEX> , which has been dogged with the image of not being aggressive on major breaking stories .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last summer</ENAMEX> , the affiliates bitterly complained to network executives about the poor coverage of the student uprising in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
`` I was not pleased with the slow start , and neither was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC News</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guy Hempel</ENAMEX> , general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> affiliate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WAVE</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ky</ENAMEX> .
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> , said the network was `` looking into what happened . ''
The stations said they were pleased with the extended coverage <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , including a special <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">five - hour edition</ENAMEX> of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today</ENAMEX> . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Browne</ENAMEX> , director of news at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC News</ENAMEX> , said in an interview that `` we could n't get a signal out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
We were out of the box .
It was horrible .
The comment we 're hearing is that we were slow out of the box , but beat everyone else in the stretch . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> broadcast throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the entire night</ENAMEX> and did not go off the air until <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
The quake postponed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> games of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the World Series</ENAMEX> .
In place of the games , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> said it planned to broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week 's</ENAMEX> episodes of its prime - time <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> lineups , except for a <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">one - hour</ENAMEX> special on the earthquake at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10 p.m. last night</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">series</ENAMEX> is scheduled to resume <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
`` There are no commercials to make up for since we 're going to eventually broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the World Series</ENAMEX> , '' said a network spokesman .
