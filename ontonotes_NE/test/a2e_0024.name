Will <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Capital Market Authority</ENAMEX> prove its integrity and suspend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> now in accordance with its regulations ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dirawi</ENAMEX>
Will <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Capital Market Authority</ENAMEX> suspend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> after his conference , as it suspended others in accordance with its rules ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Kanhal 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</ENAMEX> statement for which he was suspended .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Kanhal</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Sidq Company</ENAMEX> is an industrial company and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the founding companies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ansab Corporation</ENAMEX>
And my information is about its good future plans .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Mubrid Company</ENAMEX> is a company that owns the biggest land transport fleet in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> , because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> is considered <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the biggest exporting and importing countries in the world .
Speaking of his support for investor ownership in companies , he explained that this phenomenon is healthy due to the presence of a young generation of holders of scientific qualifications and administrative expertise , a matter that changes the policies and activities of some companies to generate a greater profit .
Speaking of his expectations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> market during the coming period in light of the big growth in some companies , he said : " The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> market has a number of incentives that are helping it to grow , these being the proximity of announcing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> quarter , the rise in petroleum prices , and the close announcement of share division and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capital Market Authority</ENAMEX> regulations for starting consultants ' and brokering offices .
Speaking of his support for some of the investors expanding into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Gulf</ENAMEX> markets , he said I do not support that , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> stock market is considered <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the biggest markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> , and investing in it does very well .
We praise God that the daily value of the market has reached <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty - five billion</ENAMEX> .
This reflects the strength and solidity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> market .
Finally , he asked the CEOs of companies to apply the regulations issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Capital Market Authority</ENAMEX> at that time to maintain the rights of shareholders .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Kanhal</ENAMEX> praised the regulations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Capital Market Authority</ENAMEX> governed by His Excellency Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jammaz al - Suhaimi</ENAMEX> .
The new regulations it had endorsed maintained the market 's balance .
We are still awaiting many more regulations from it .

or will the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Authority</ENAMEX> prove its failure and confirm that it is only a scarecrow solely against the poor and the weak .

Riyadh - Fahd al - Marikhi : Photography by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saleh al - Jamia</ENAMEX>
His Royal Highness , Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed ibn Talal</ENAMEX> , the CEO of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Kingdom Holding Company</ENAMEX> , has announced the pumping of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 10 billion riyals</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> share and property markets , explaining that <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">over five billion riyals</ENAMEX> will be distributed to a number of sectors , these being : the banking sector , through the increase of investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Samba Financial Group</ENAMEX> to make its share <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">larger than 5 percent ;</ENAMEX> the industrial sector through the increase in investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Industrialization Company</ENAMEX> to increase the share of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Kingdom Holding Company</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 percent</ENAMEX> ; and the food production sector through the increase in investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Safola Company</ENAMEX> to make its share <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">larger than 13 percent</ENAMEX> ; and the media sector through a new investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Saudi Research and Publishing company</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 25 percent</ENAMEX> share in the company , in addition to the investment in a number of companies that will soon be publicly listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> stock market , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Mid Gulf company</ENAMEX> in the insurance sector .
During a press conference held be him yesterday at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> headquarters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Kingdom Holding Company</ENAMEX> , Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> explained that the pumping of this money has taken more time than anticipated , but confirmed that it was not for speculation but for investment purposes
the relevant state authorities have been informed of these investments in accordance with the transparency principle in use
Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> explained that the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five billion</ENAMEX> were invested in the property sector that included the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> project which will be launched in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first quarter of the current financial year</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jeddah</ENAMEX> project which will be launched <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at the beginning of the coming year</ENAMEX> indicating that an area of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">165 million square meters</ENAMEX> of land had actually been purchased by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Kingdom Holding Company</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> and another area of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">53 million square meters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jeddah</ENAMEX> for the establishment of these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> projects . and a study undertaken to turn these property companies in the future into ones publicly listed on the share market .
The total costs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jeddah</ENAMEX> project is expected to amount to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately 50 billion riyals</ENAMEX> and will turn the map of the town upside down .
It includes a high multi-purpose tower ,
and the project will also include a residential district with an area of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 million square meters</ENAMEX> , shopping areas and an educational area as well as areas for commercial offices , entertainment , tourism and hotels .
The possibility of developing a diplomatic quarter is being examined at present , while taking into consideration all the required specifications for this quarter .
The entire planning for this project is being done by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> international company .
Speaking of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> project , Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> said that it is situated on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dammam</ENAMEX> road .
The project , the execution of which will start shortly , will include a tourist resort project managed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fairmont</ENAMEX>
The total value of the investment upon completion of the project will be about <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 billion riyals</ENAMEX> , and it will include a residential quarter containing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135 thousand</ENAMEX> residential units .
Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> reported that he had previously mentioned that the market was facing danger <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">some five months</ENAMEX> prior to its collapse <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last February</ENAMEX> , pointing out that when the stock market surpassed the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 thousand</ENAMEX> points , that was exaggerated and illogical because the Price Earnings Ratio in some companies were reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a thousand riyals</ENAMEX> and that was not possible .
That collapse was expected , not to mention the speculation that occurred .
With the revival of the petro-market and the increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> 's revenue , both of the government or the citizens , there was a lot of money and limited investment opportunities ,
so inflation occurred , leading to the collapse and not a single <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> family escaped being hit .
Even in the current market situation , if we compare to the Price Earning Ratio then it is still logical and realistic ,
He pointed out that current share prices were logical and reasonable . and demanded investors stop speculating because that leads to many bankruptcies .
He said that there are companies on the market in which profit potential was nonexistent .
He applauded the decision of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Capital Market Authority</ENAMEX> to suspend dealings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> companies and said that it was a wise decision but it had come too late as there were fears from speculators of suspending the shares of other companies , and this is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the state 's rights , to suspend dealing in the shares of companies that were hopeless .
He indicated that there might be other companies whose shares will be suspended and that investors should buy into companies that , it was hoped , would remain and continue .
Speaking of the timing of this announcement and the reasons for it , Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> said that the undertaking to pump <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 billion riyals</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> market was made <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last March</ENAMEX> and that the investment he had undertaken was not completed till <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ago</ENAMEX> and therefore it was being announced .
He hoped that the market had hit the bottom but without any mad rises as had happened in the past , as they were short - term paper profits .
He expected that the current year would witness the restoration of equilibrium to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> market after reaching a kind of sensibility .
He explained that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> authorities were insistent on driving out the speculators who were pushing the market into harming them and the small investors .
He pointed out that the market is looking for a bottom to hit thereafter to be able to rise in a logical and reasonable way
He indicated that the market was looking for a bottom at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7000</ENAMEX> points or slightly less .
He added : " We do not want the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> stock market to return to insane and unacceptable figures as it did in the past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Kingdom Holding Company</ENAMEX> is investing in the market to restore confidence in it .
More importantly , the investor must be educated to invest in companies that have a good future . "
Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Kingdom Holding Company</ENAMEX> is continuing with its plans to list for sale a percentage of its shares agreed upon with the state , to reach a figure that serves the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> citizen and does not harm the future interests of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Company</ENAMEX> and its expansions .
He stressed that even in the current market conditions the company would be listing its shares on the market in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the current year</ENAMEX> .
Speaking of the downturn on the stock market in light of the increasing petroleum revenues and the record budget achieved by the state during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two financial years</ENAMEX> , Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> said that the stock market is a mirror of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> economy . but if the stock market was exaggerated then there would be a difference between the state of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> market in general and the stock market and this is what happened .
He offered a number of suggestions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Finance</ENAMEX> and officials to help the companies , namely : to allow companies to buy their shares immediately which would give trust in the market and would reduce the number of dealt in shares on the market and thus increase the amount of profit ; to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="4">non-Saudi</ENAMEX> companies and corporations to enter the market by placing controls such as instituting sectors for shares and an ownership percentage ceiling ; and to oblige companies to disclose future expectations of the companies ' performances .
A discussion with the CEOs of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> companies has been initiated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Kingdom Holding Company</ENAMEX> by sending them letters dealing with the disclosure of the companies ' future expectations .
This is done by all companies in the developed world with the aim of obliging the company to achieve the declared profit or something close to it and to re-assure the investor .
Finally , more disclosures between the company and the investor , since there are companies with specific profit achieving strategies not from its basic accredited activities , such as achieving non-repeatable profit .
He added : " We wish to remove the weak companies that do not represent the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> economy from the market and separate them from the companies with big profits . "
He confirmed that these proposals would be made to state officials to be applied to companies .
Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> denied that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Kingdom Holding Company</ENAMEX> had liquidized any portfolio it had in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> ,
but on the contrary , it had increased its investments in a number of companies , and in addition did not enter into any speculation at all but is working on buying and keeping for investment .
He also denied that the collapse of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last February</ENAMEX> was planned by any party , but it rather occurred because of the illogical prices reached by the market .
He indicated that the collapse was expected because of the inflation in share prices and said that any person familiar with the stock market will confirm that the collapse was imminent at that time .
He explained that the state could not in any way be made responsible for the losses of investors on the market and must remain neutral on that .
The role of the state is to prevent the manipulators from exposing the market to fluctuations , to punish them and to suspend bankrupt companies .
He pointed out that there is a study on dividing the market because it was difficult to place profitable , strong companies alongside weak loss - making ones , and this is where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Capital Market Authority</ENAMEX> plays a role .
He called upon the investors and not the experience lacking speculators in the market , to go to investment funds and banks to invest their finances in a professional manner , so as to avoid getting caught in market fluctuations and become exposed to losses .
As for the stagnation in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> economy , it is not probable , because <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> and at the peak of the stock market collapse , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> economy flourished and achieved a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 per cent</ENAMEX> growth , because there is a difference in the course of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> economy and that of the stock market .
He asserted that expectations indicate there will be no stagnation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> economy during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the current year</ENAMEX> due to its strength , especially in the light of the serious strong steps taken by the government to not to concentrate on the petroleum factor .
Regarding the company 's competition for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> license to operate cell phones in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> , he said that they have an alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Turkish Turkcell Company</ENAMEX> to compete for this license , and as regards the license for fixed phones , the company will not enter into such competition .
Regarding the investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bank of China</ENAMEX> , Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> said that the company had applied to invest as a representative of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> world and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> , based on a request made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> authorities .
He pointed out that the company requested an investment of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">two billion dollars</ENAMEX> but had allocated only <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">300 million dollars</ENAMEX> for the company and the deal went through .
The profits gained from listing the company 's shares amounted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 25 per cent</ENAMEX> .

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The Skull - capped One</ENAMEX>
There is a number of questions whose answers would let us know what the course of the market will be ?
Is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed 's</ENAMEX> view with his team of analysts and consultants that these sinking levels might form a bottom to the market ?
Do these growing profits and collapsing prices form an historic opportunity for investment ?
Will the major investors return with the entry of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> as it is generally known that any market has its bottom with the investors and its peak with the speculators ?
Has investment become more advantageous in the medium and long terms ?
Will the course of the market and the method of dealing with it change after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a whole year</ENAMEX> of collapse ?
The features of the answers to this questions will become evident during the coming period , starting from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> .

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dirawi</ENAMEX>
We are picking the condemnations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> from the news which the writer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JARIR</ENAMEX> has added and providing a commentary in red .
through the increase of investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Samba Financial Group</ENAMEX> to make its share <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">larger than 5 percent</ENAMEX> ; the industrial sector through the increase in investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Industrialization Company</ENAMEX> to increase the share of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Kingdom Holding Company</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 percent</ENAMEX> ; and the food production sector through the increase in investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Safola Company</ENAMEX> to make its share <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">larger than 13 percent</ENAMEX> ; and the media sector through a new investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Saudi Research and Publishing company</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 25 percent</ENAMEX> share in the company , in addition to the investment in a number of companies that will soon be publicly listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> stock market , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Mid Gulf company</ENAMEX> in the insurance sector .
During a press conference held be him <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> headquarters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Kingdom Holding Company</ENAMEX> , Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> explained that pumping of this money had taken more time than anticipated . but confirmed that it was not for speculation but rather for investment .
the relevant state authorities have been informed of these investments in pursuance of the principle of transparency being used .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Months ago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> declared the pumping of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">ten billion riyals</ENAMEX> and specified companies that were " respectable " according to his claim .
He won the confidence of some and small speculators entered the market , whereupon an artificial surge occurred , then they were caught in the collapses which followed that made - up surge and which have continued until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> had lost his credibility on the market .
He had to change his rhetoric if he wanted to restore his credibility in order to continue his mission of beating the market -LRB- as some believe -RRB- .
Thus he had to specify in his present statement , in addition to the names of the companies , the percentage he owns in each company -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 5 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Samba</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturing</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 13 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Safola</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 25 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Research</ENAMEX> , ... etc. -RRB-
Speaking of the timing of this announcement and the reasons for it , Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> said that the undertaking to pump <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 billion riyals</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> market was made <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last March</ENAMEX> . and that the investment he had undertaken was not completed till <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ago</ENAMEX> and therefore it was being announced .
It is not possible to believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> had been " only " collecting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">since last March -LRB- almost a year ago -RRB- until now</ENAMEX> . Because , if that had happened , then the rates of his prices would be much higher than the current prices .
This would be unreasonable behavior from an opportunist like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> .
And so this explanation of his is untruthful .
" He expected that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the current year</ENAMEX> would witness the restoration of equilibrium to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> market after reaching a kind of sensibility . "
This expression seems to have <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides to it :
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> is to send a signal to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Market Authority</ENAMEX> that he does not want to create a very strong imaginary surge
and this might mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Market Authority</ENAMEX> is being informed that he will be satisfied with less profit than his -LRB- counterpart -RRB- and then get out .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> : to win the dealers ' belief that the market might have hit the bottom and that they should safely enter with their cash and begin raising its index .
" He explained that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> authorities were insistent on driving out the speculators who were pushing the market into harming them and the small investors . "
In this clause of the statement he is assuring the minds of dealers that does not intend to dispose of his shares to them through this action of his , and so they should enter and raise up the index of his companies .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Kingdom Holding Company</ENAMEX> is investing in the market to restore confidence in it . "
And " more importantly , the investor must be educated to invest in companies that have a good future . "
Here <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed</ENAMEX> confirms sowing of trust in the hearts of speculators but only if they enter and give a boost to his companies .
That 's why he finished by saying " educating the investor "
It is the pinnacle of education when the speculators enter into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Waleed 's</ENAMEX> companies and get stuck , since the blow might be final .
