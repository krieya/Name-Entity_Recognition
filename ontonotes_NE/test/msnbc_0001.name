He was charged with public intoxication and resisting arrest /.
Police are facing more rowdy behavior as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans '</ENAMEX> nightlife makes a comeback /.
But officials said the force used in this arrest was not appropriate /.
There is no excuse for officers not maintaining the high standards of this agency and serving this public /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> police have already lost their superintendent been accused of looting and seen <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> colleagues take their own lives during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Katrina</ENAMEX> stress that surfaced when this officer grabbed a producer from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Associated Press television</ENAMEX> who caught the arrest on tape /.
Some say they now fear a racial backlash because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> the suspect was black and the officers appear white mistrust that may threaten the fragile recovery in a town that has already been through enough /.
That was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Kitnea</ENAMEX> /.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> police officers in those pictures <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lance Schilling</ENAMEX> uh and and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Evangelist</ENAMEX> who subdued <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> and SE <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> who allegedly grabbed the AP uh producer were in municipal court today /.
They pled not guilty to simple battery charges which is a misdemeanor trial set for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January eleventh</ENAMEX> /.
The officers are out on bond /.
Before we talk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> police let me say we are getting late breaking word from the attorney uh for the man on that tape now saying his client was not even drinking that night /.
Captain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlon Defillo</ENAMEX> spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> police department joins me uh now by phone /.
Captain I 'm sorry we keep having to talk under these kinds of circumstances /.
Let me ask you first specifically about about the tape /.
You 've seen the tape /.
it looks horrible /.
What do you make of it /?
Well the tape is troubling /.
You know when this was brought on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> uh the superintendent who was out of town uh assembled his his senior managers including myself /.
We had gone to see the tape /.
and of course the tape was troubling to the point where we believe that the officers involved uh uh used used more than was necessary /.
Uh clearly we believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> was resisting /.
However we believe that the -- that the force used by the officers was not acceptable based on department policy as well as the training that we give police officers /.
Um and I should say you 're on a cell phone so we 're having a little trouble /.
If uh if we continue to have this we 'll have you call back /.
But uh let me a- -- Captain i- i- is it fair to a- -- to to ask the question are some on the police department kind of losing it /?
I mean even when I was down there I saw the kinds of hours uh that people were working etcetera /.
and I know that there was a -- the goal was to give a lot of people some time off uh right after this happened in order to allow them to to get their wits back to be able to relax a little bit /.
But you know you look at this guy you know punching the the one guy grabbing the AP producer you know /.
these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> at least l- give you the sense that some on the force are kind of losing it /.
Well I certainly do n't want to to to uh any kind of excuse the officers involved /.
but you know police officers have been working for the last <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> weeks uh under some very challenging times /.
Uh but let me just say we have more than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thousand</ENAMEX> employees on the police department and certainly th- the incident that occured on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> uh does not reflect the the the vast majority of the hard men and wom- -- hard working men and women of this department /.
But um just so we 're clear you are not defending the actions of those police officers , correct /?
No I 'm -- I 'm not /.
otherwise I would n't have suspended them and to have them charged with battery /.
So no /.
but clearly the police department /-
When this was brought to our attention um uh the quick and decisive action was taken /.
And I think that 's very important for the public that 's listening to this or looking at this newscast that uh question answered that once these types of issues are are brought to the attention of the administration what is the administration going to do /?
And certainly um we w- -- we have a zero tolerance for this type of behavior /.
and when something like of this magnitude occurs we 're going to take the appropriate action /.
and it it 's going to be swift and decisive and effective /.
Captain final question /.
the the attorney for that man is saying he was n't even drinking uh that night /.
You know anything about that /?
No that 's the first I 've heard of that /.
And again um there will be -- there everyone will have their day in court /.
You know the officers are going to have their day in court /.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> is going to have his day in court /.
and let me just go on to say that how serious this department is about discipline /.
The the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Associated Press</ENAMEX> producer did not want to press charges /.
Uh we decided -- the police department decided that that we 're going to pursue charges on on the behalf of /.
so uh that 's how serious we are about making sure that our officers do the right thing /.
And let me also add that that you know there 's -- there 's not a police department in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">America</ENAMEX> that 's not having -- that 's not having personnel problems /.
The question is again once you find you have problem personnel what do you do with them /?
Do you -- do you uh /.
or do you deal with issues /?
And we dealt with those issues /.
Well look it i- -- it is good to see that this -- uh that we 're not hearing what we sometimes hear in this case is these kinds of cases which is well you know you got to understand the circumstances and the tape is n't showing everything /.
Basically you 're saying look we took action /.
it was unacceptable /.
Captain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Defillo</ENAMEX> thanks a lot for coming on the prorgram /.
You 're welcome /.
thank you /.
Eddie Jordan Jr. is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> district attorney /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria Habathee</ENAMEX> is a psychologist who 's been counseling law enforcement for the past twenty years /.
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Tackapena</ENAMEX> is the uh famed criminal defense attorney who 's represented police officers in brutality uh cases /.
Alright um District Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> let me start with you /.
Is your office also investigating this /?
Uh indeed my office is investigating this matter /.
Uh we just opened our investigation today when we learned about uh this very unfortunate incident /.
Um and how does it work /?
I mean they 've been charged in a municipal court /.
Are you bascially you know like /-
You you guys are effectively the big boys compared to to municipal court /.
Is it possible that you would simply take over say this is too serious /.
it 's too important /.
my office is going to handle it /?
Uh that is a distinct possibility /.
Uh we will conduct our own investigation /.
and if we determine that state charges are more appropriate uh then we will ask the city attorney to defer to the district attorney 's office /.
An- a- you think it 's fair do n't you Mr. District Attorney to look at this tape and be horrified /?
Oh I do n't think there 's any question about this /.
Uh this uh this footage that we 've seen is is unconscionable /.
an- and it it it certainly demands some explanation /.
Um let me read uh this this quote as I I go to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria Habathee</ENAMEX> /.
this is from uh Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Osofsky</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LSU medical school</ENAMEX> /.
There is no disaster that has had the amount of trauma for a department that this has where so many police officers have lost homes been separated from their families had loved ones living in other places with no idea uh when they will return /.
Uh actually first let me go to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Tackapena</ENAMEX> on that /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> is that a legal defense meaning could these guys come into court and say we were so traumatized by everything that happened that it eventually led to this /?
Yes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> quite frankly it is /.
I mean it s- -- it 'd be an unusual in a plea um sort of defense when you 're defending cops because normally their mental health is not in question /.
But in this instance it could be a defense /.
and more importantly as a trial lawyer what it would really be called is jury nullification /.
What you 're seeing on this tape is a black eye /.
There 's really no excuse for it /.
Um it it was unjustified by any training manual across the country /.
but but what I just heard from that doctor from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LSU</ENAMEX> and what the fact of the matter is is that these cops were working you know <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty four hour</ENAMEX> shifts some of them sleeping in their cars being displaced /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three quarters</ENAMEX> of them lost their homes /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> of them do n't know where their families are /.
The level of trauma /-
And look that guy who who approached the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AP</ENAMEX> uh newsman clearly had lost it period end of story because you heard it /.
And he was n't even -- he was just basically saying I 'm trying to keep alive go home /.
Uh h- he had clearly at that point lost it /.
and these are cops who literally slept in their car for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty four hour</ENAMEX> shifts /.
Here here 's -- here 's some of what we 've seen from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> police since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">hurricane Katrina</ENAMEX> /.
These guys stayed /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> officers um committed suicide /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred and forty nine</ENAMEX> investigated for leaving their posts without permission /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve</ENAMEX> officers investigated for looting or condoning looting /.
and and you have -- uh you have this /.
And also some dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> /.
There are -- there are uncounted officers that are dead /.
They 're missing about <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three hundred</ENAMEX> from last count /.
Well tha- that was the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred and forty nine</ENAMEX> investigated for leaving their posts /.
Let me just say that uh from the standpoint of a prosecutor I I respectfully disagree uh with that position /.
I I think that uh neither frustration nor fatigue would justify this kind of misconduct /.
And the citizens are are not going to tolerate uh police officers engaging in brutality uh because of the uh extraordinary circumstances that we have going on today /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria Habathee</ENAMEX> if you were asked to testify in some sort of be proceeding be it a pre-trial hearing be it a trial be it to to provide uh general thoughts on on the psychological condi- conditions of some of these officers knowing what you know about what happened in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">New Orleans</ENAMEX> , is it fair for some of them to say everything that happened the amount of hours we were working the fact that we 've been away from our families etcetera from the psychological point of view does that explain what we see on the video tape /?
I ca n't justify what 's on the video tape /.
It does explain in the sense the human reaction to such a a excessive event /.
And remembering that these officers were not only keeping the peace so to speak and uh responding but they were also victims /.
Um and would you -- I mean w- we we heard /-
This is number <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> /.
if can pull this one up /.
this from Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Osofsky</ENAMEX> again <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LSU medical school</ENAMEX> /.
Following <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nine eleven</ENAMEX> there was a known enemy a known situation /.
and even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> buildings were destroyed and lives lost the people who survived could go to their homes /.
the city of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">New York</ENAMEX> was not destroyed /.
the country around it was not destroyed /.
Is that uh relevant do you think in terms of a psychological comparison /?
I do n't if I believe there is a psychological comparison /.
In my mind I compare to some of the federal agents who were uh injured or involved in hur- <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Andrew</ENAMEX> a few years ago /.
and all they wanted to do was get home to their families /.
Yet their jobs are to be there for the public /.
and they they have n't talked to their families /.
and that 's a superhuman request that we make of them /.
We do make it /.
Sorry /.
here 's Lieutenant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Binelli</ENAMEX> the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Police Association of New Orleans</ENAMEX> /.
Everybody 's under a lot of stress /.
but I think the men and women in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> police department on the -- on the whole are coping with it as best they can /.
I do n't -- I 'm not ready to say at this particular time until we are actually able to talk to the officers in depth about the actions if stress had anything to do with this situation /.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> to clarify what you were saying before I mean look you 're n- -- you 're not actually saying that you think it 's a winnable etcetera /.
You 're s- simply saying that you think it 's something that should be evaluated as a defense attorney , right /.
And and that 's exac- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> exactly right /.
Look it does n't justify what happened /.
but I think you need to sit down with the client /.
And look another important and hopefully the district attorney will take a look at this when he 's evaluating what to do is who are these cops /.
I mean when I 'm representing a cop the first thing I do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> is get that personnel file /.
Is this someone with a history /?
Is this someone who you know has a propensity towards always being involved in these high in- d- you know um sort of physical contact type deals /?
Or are these great cops who have not had a blemish on their record /.
and if so should they be cut a break here if they really lose it /?
Very quickly DA <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> /.
does that matter /?
I think the focus is going to be on their conduct in this particular situation and whether it was justified or not /.
And uh I I ca n't imagine uh why they would punch someone in the back of the head uh when i- in uh in connection with subduing that person /.
All right District Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddie Jordan</ENAMEX> thank you for coming back on the program /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria Habathee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Tackapena</ENAMEX> good to see you /.
thanks a lot /.
Last week police found the body of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> college student <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor Biehl</ENAMEX> /.
Still no charges have been filed against the key suspect /.
Her father joins us <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">next</ENAMEX> /.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richmond</ENAMEX> police also looking for another teenage girl <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Sharp</ENAMEX> went out for a walk with her dog <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks ago</ENAMEX> /.
Her dog came home /.
she did not /.
Plus the battle over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harriet Miers '</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> nomination /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Evangelical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christian</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Dobson</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> advisor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Rove</ENAMEX> told him something that makes him comfortable with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miers</ENAMEX> /.
Do n't the rest of us deserve to know what he knows /?
Your email MSNBC dot com /.
Please include your name where you 're writing from /.
Our repsonse at the end of the show /.
The only suspect in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor Biehl</ENAMEX> murder case behind bars but yet to be charged with any crime in this case /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> last seen leaving her dorm room at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Virginia Commonwealth University</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September fifth</ENAMEX> /.
Her remains were found <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Thursday</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Matthews County Virgina</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seventy miles</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Richmond</ENAMEX> /.
The police ended up there after the ex-girlfriend of the chief suspect identified the area from the photograph /.
The suspect <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty eight year old</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Folly</ENAMEX> /.
He admits to having a sexual relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> says he last saw her at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">nine thirty</ENAMEX> the night she disappeared /.
He also says that he was kidnapped the same night that she went missing /.
Joining me now is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Biehl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> 's father /.
Thank you very much uh for coming on the program /.
I know this uh has to be a difficult time and week for you /.
and so we appreciate you taking the time /.
Thank you for inviting me /.
Um how are you holding up /?
I 'm good sometimes bad /.
You know it comes and goes /.
uh a lot of different things remind me of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> and um can choke me up a little bit /.
What do you make of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Folly</ENAMEX> guy /?
Had you ever heard of him before all this started /?
Uh I had met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Folly</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February</ENAMEX> uh of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> when I took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> down to look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VCU</ENAMEX> as a possible school that she might want to attend /.
And uh what what happened at that meeting /?
Well I was dropping <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> off /.
Um she was actually staying in that ap- uh townhouse with the friend that she knew from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Madison high school</ENAMEX> where she graduated from /.
and him and his girlfriend lived there /.
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Folly</ENAMEX> was their roommate /.
And frankly I d- -- I did n't get a sense of urgency at that point because I had no idea of his age and thought he was just a student at the school /.
So it was a -- it was a very brief meeting at that /.
About about <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">ten or fifteen minutes</ENAMEX> yeah /.
Um all right an- an- now now that you know so much more have you heard anything from the authorities about uh if and when , they 're going to charge him in connection with this case /?
No uh it 's my information that they are still processing um evidence from the crime scene as well as evidence from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> 's body /.
Um i- the you know like from the beginning it seems to me that this guy had to be the the chief su- /-
This this this this silliness about he was kidnapped on the same night that that she went missing etcetera /.
Ha- have you gotten the impression uh that from the beginning that he was the one they were looking at /?
Well I I I do n't know if it 's -- he 's the only one that they 're looking at or if there 's other people that they 're looking at /.
Certainly my presumption is that he i- -- he would be considered uh a primary suspect /.
Yeah ne- and here 's -- here 's what the police chief uh said about it uh on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> /.
A dog tracked a scent from her car to uh a gentleman 's uh named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Schultz</ENAMEX> /.
And it seems very coincidental and suspicious to me /.
and I think the authorities are looking into any connection there /.
All right that was n't the piece of sound I was looking for /.
and and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Peterson</ENAMEX> is the attorney um for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> 's mother /.
He 's speaking there /.
What what he had said was we certainly believe that strongest suspect uh they already have in custody /.
He was talking there about someone else who apparently has been cleared um as a suspect uh in this case /.
Um tell me about the rest of family /.
How 's -- uh i- is is there some level of um you know /.
I hate the word closure because it always makes it seem like it 's -- it 's over when that th- that it 's not and the the pain continues /. /.
but was was there a a sense of relief closure I do n't know what the word is to use when when you heard that finally they had found <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> /?
For me there was /.
it was um you know rather than sitting around waiting for a phone call or waiting for her to call us or wondering why she had n't called her mother or I /.
Um it was i- i- -- it was closing that /.
at least we knew where she was and what had happened to her to some extent /.
that she was not there was a reason for her not calling us /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Biehl</ENAMEX> thank you very much uh for for taking the time /.
and uh again i- in these kinds of stories it it 's -- it 's odd because myself and my staff feel like we get to know some of the people involved in these cases even though we do n't truly know them /.
But um thank you very much for taking the time /.
and as much as we can our hearts uh our hearts do go out to you /.
and uh we have been thinking about you and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> for the last few weeks /.
Thank you /.
Now to another uh case another missing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Richmond Virginia</ENAMEX> girl <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Sharp</ENAMEX> last seen leaving her house to walk her dog at around <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">ten thirty am</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September eighteenth</ENAMEX> /.
Her mother filed a missing persons report <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">later</ENAMEX> that day /.
Monica 's family and the police believe that she 's with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty seven year old</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Nichols</ENAMEX> but left with him voluntarily after meeting him on the internet /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> has a personal webpage appears to have last logged on to it <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days after</ENAMEX> she went missing /.
Joining me now on the phone is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Sharp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> 's mother /.
Uh Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sharpe</ENAMEX> I say the same thing to you /.
uh I know this is a very tough time for you /.
so I thank you for taking the time /.
Um tell us what you know about uh about this gentleman who you think that your uh your daughter is with /.
Really w- we do n't really know anything about him /.
We just know that he 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty seven</ENAMEX> /.
apparently he had an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Illinois</ENAMEX> driver 's license but does not necessarily reside there /.
Um a- and we just -- we do n't know anything about him /.
Um why is it that -- why are are the authorities do you think so confident uh that she is with him /?
I think that they were seen together in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Richmond</ENAMEX> um either <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> /.
Uh she w- -- sh- she was missing on a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> /.
and I think <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> she was seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Richmond</ENAMEX> with him /.
and the person who observed them called the police /.
You know so it 's w- was a tip to the police /.
And is the -- is the belief that they they met online somehow and set up a meeting /?
Yes yes /.
Well well yes I think it the belief is that they met online /.
and um you know we 've -- we 've -- they have taken all that information off our computer /.
and we have seen small portions of the conversations that they had together some of which indicate that they were planning to meet /.
but there was no indication that they were planning to meet that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> /.
So in other words you know when she woke up went out and walked her dog she did n't take anything with her like keys her purse her money or clothing or you know or anything like that /.
So you know we 're -- we 're -- we do realize that there are these um transcripts of some conversations that they had but apparently nothing that indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">that morning</ENAMEX> they were planning to meet /.
A- any of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> 's friends able to provide any other information /?
No we have talked to everyone /.
and they are stunned because you know sh- she saw them every day , she talked to them but she did n't say anything about this /.
All right well look this is one of these cases where we do n't ha- just have to look back where we can actually look forward and hope that someone has seen her and can call the authorities /.
That 's why um <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda</ENAMEX> 's taken the time to came on the program /.
Eight oh four six four six six seven six four that 's the number uh if you 've seen her /.
and we showed you the picture um of the man that she is uh suspected of being with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Nichols</ENAMEX> /.
Thank you very much uh Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharp</ENAMEX> /.
and uh good luck to you /.
Thank you /.
thank you /.
Coming up , some senators want to know what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">White House</ENAMEX> advisor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Rove</ENAMEX> told this man to make him so comfortable with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> nominee <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harriet Miers</ENAMEX> even though many of his allies are not /.
And they were allegedly murdered by convicted sex offender <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Duncan</ENAMEX> /.
Now their families are suing a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> county where he was charged with a different crime /.
Unfortunately I think they 're going to have an uphill battle /.
We 'll talk about it /.
And our continuing series <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose</ENAMEX> our effort to help find missing sex offenders before they strike again /.
Our search <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> is in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">California</ENAMEX> /.

If you 've got any information regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowen</ENAMEX> please contact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">California Department of Justice</ENAMEX> nine one six two two seven four nine seven four /.
We 're back in a minute /.
Coming up the battle over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> nominee <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harriet Miers</ENAMEX> /.
Did <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the White House</ENAMEX> provide assurances to some conservatives about her beliefs on hot button topics like abortion /?
Should n't those people have to testify during her confirmation hearing so everyone will know /?
First the headlines /.
Hello I 'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Fitzgerald</ENAMEX> /.
and here 's what 's happening /.
Amid the devastation after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> 's powerful earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Pakistan</ENAMEX> some dramatic rescues /.
Residents of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> city used bare hands even crowbars to free <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> girls buried in a school for more than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> days /.
A woman and child were also pulled from the rubble of an apartment building /.
Officials estimate as many as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thirty thousand</ENAMEX> were killed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Pakistan</ENAMEX> alone and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">India</ENAMEX> /.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> is promising at least <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">fifty million dollars</ENAMEX> in aid /.
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> is accepting aid from rival <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> /.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">New Orleans</ENAMEX> to get an update on progress following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">hurricanes Katrina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Rita</ENAMEX> /.
He dined <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the French quarter</ENAMEX> and is staying in a hotel there /.
It 's his <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighth</ENAMEX> visit to the hurricane area /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</ENAMEX> of people in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Colorado</ENAMEX> are without power after a major snowstorm /.
It 's dumped up to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twenty inches</ENAMEX> of wet heavy snow in some areas /.
At least <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> death is blamed on the storm by a woman who was hit by a falling tree limb /.
You 're up to date /.
let 's head back now to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Abrams Report</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Abrams</ENAMEX> /.
In my interviews with any judge I never ask their personal opinion on the subject of abortion /.
Uh not to my -- not t- not to my recollection have I ever sat down with her /.
What I have done is understand the type of person she is and the type of judge she will be /.
With so many unanswered questions circulating about President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> nominee <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harriet Miers '</ENAMEX> position on some of the most controversial issues it seems one person believes he 's got the answers /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Dobson</ENAMEX> founder of the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Evangelical</ENAMEX> group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Focus On The Family</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> on his radio show that he 's got some inside info /.
When you -- and you 'll have to trust me on this one when you know some of the things that I know that I probably should n't know uh that take me in this direction you will understand why I have said with fear and trepidation why I have um said that I believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harriet Miers</ENAMEX> will be a good justice /.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> if I have made a mistake here I will never forget it /.
The blood of those babies that will die will be on my hands to some degree /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dobson</ENAMEX> admitted during the same broadcast last week that he had numerous conversations with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> advisor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Rove</ENAMEX> about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miers</ENAMEX> nomination /.
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> at least some of them are calling on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dobson</ENAMEX> to come before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> and reveal what he was told /.
If there are back room assurances and if there 're back room deals and if there are something which bears upon a pre-condition as to uh how a nominee is going to vote I think that 's uh a matter that ought to be known by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> peop- /.
If uh Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dobson</ENAMEX> knows something uh that uh he should n't know or something that I ought to know I 'm going to find out /.
Remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arlen Specter</ENAMEX> of course is a uh pro-choice <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> /.
The question should <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dobson</ENAMEX> be forced to tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> what information he 's got on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miers</ENAMEX> /.
If he refuses should he be subpoenaed /?
Joining us now to answer some of those questions <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Sekulow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Conservative American Center for Law and Justice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliot Minkford</ENAMEX> legal director for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Liberal People for the American Way</ENAMEX> /.
All right uh gentlemen thanks very much uh for coming on /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay</ENAMEX> do you have any problems uh with um for- with forcing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dobson</ENAMEX> to come in and say who told you this and what he say -- what did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rove</ENAMEX> say to you /?
Well I I do n't have a -- look the the Congress has -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> has subpoena power /.
they could ask him to come in voluntarily /.
They could ask him to come in through a subpoena /.
They can also which will probably happen through the investigative process that 's probably under way as we speak <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> find out about the this information /.
But let me tell you something /.
and as someone that 's been very involved in this process of judicial selection and someone 's worked with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the White House</ENAMEX> I had no assurances given /.
and I ca n't imagine that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Dobson</ENAMEX> did either /.
I I think some of the things that he 's talking about and I think this will come out in in due course are the statements that were made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathan Hecht</ENAMEX> her friend who 's of course a justice on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Texas Supreme Court</ENAMEX> which was on the news um right immediately after the nomination /.
so there was n't any great surprise there /.
I ca n't imagine uh that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Rove</ENAMEX> or anyone else at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the White House</ENAMEX> gave information /.
Which is what /?
Uh they talked about that that they she attended a church /.
it was her faith based committments /.
uh that 's what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathan Hecht</ENAMEX> talked about /.
and talked about that she 's a conservative /.
But look no one knows how this woman 's going to vote on a particular case /.
I do agree with the President that we know she has a conservative judicial philosophy /.
the President after all is given the authority to nominate /.
but if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Dobson</ENAMEX> knew something that he was n't supposed to it will come out /.
I suspect that 's not the case at all /.
This is what uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuck Schummer</ENAMEX> said on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Face The Nation</ENAMEX> about it /.
I believe that we ought to call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Dobson</ENAMEX> as a witness at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate judiciary</ENAMEX> hearings and find out what kind of assurances he 's received /.
If those assurances are good enough for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Dobson</ENAMEX> then all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> ought to hear them /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliot Minkford</ENAMEX> what do you make of that /?
I think Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schummer</ENAMEX> and Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Specter</ENAMEX> are absolutely right /.
The concerns that have been raised about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harriet Miers</ENAMEX> include will she truly be an independent voice on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> not just doing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W Bush 's</ENAMEX> wishes and does she have a basic committement to fundamental constitutional values /.
I suspect that what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dobson</ENAMEX> found out leads him to believe that she will vote the way he wants her to to overturn <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Roe versus Wade</ENAMEX> and do a lot of those things /.
But it wait /.
wait /.
is it possible that all they say to her all they said to r- -- to -- to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dobson</ENAMEX> behind closed doors is she 's a very religious woman /. /.
uh she takes her her faith very seriously /.
it 's a dominant part of her life /.
and keep that in mind my friend /?
I mean something like that was said /. /.
let 's assume that 's what was said /.
You know that 's quite possible although if that 's all that was said you would have thought he would have said that by now /.
But the fact is not only should he be asked but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Rove</ENAMEX> should be asked what information he gave to people like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dobson</ENAMEX> /.
and frankly one of the key things is this is an advisor a person who 's known the President for more than a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</ENAMEX> and he made a decision based on what he knows about her /.
That means even more important than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dobson</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rove</ENAMEX> testifying is her testifying in a straightforwrad way what both <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> want to know /.
But that 's -- look that 's not going to happen all right /.
Look it 's not -- it 's -- that 's just -- all right tha- that 's -- all right but that 's a nice theory /.
it 's not going to happen /.
I can -- I can promise you that /.
I promise you she will not answer the questions that you want answered /.
I mean it wo n't happen /.
If you 're right about that , if you 're right about that /.
Of course I 'm /-
I would n't b- -- I would n't be surprised for the first time to see <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> senators unite and say we need to know more about the nominee /.
That may -- look tha- that may ha- -- th- that may happen /.
but anyone who 's now claiming that they expect to get the answers from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miers</ENAMEX> in the confirmation hearing , that 's going to somehow uh assure them one way or the other are just grandstanding because they know they 're not going to get it /.
Come on /.
you know you 're not getting the answers /.
She ca n't -- she ca n't say how she 's going to vote in a particular case /.
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliot</ENAMEX> you know the fact of the matter is that the President gets to make the nomination /.
Whether she can or she ca n't she 's not going to /.
But you know well enough that that 's not what we 're talking about /.
She c- well y- look /.
What we 're talking about is /.
No what we 're talking about actually is whether information was given from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the White House</ENAMEX> to /-
Hang on /.
one at a time /.
one at a t- /-
ha- ha- ha- hang on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay</ENAMEX> /.
go ahead /.
hang on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay</ENAMEX> /.
one at a time /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Sekulow</ENAMEX> go ahead /.
H- h- here here 's wha- -- here 's what we 've got /.
The question today is does were there assurances given to some on the conservative side with regard to uh d- Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miers</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harriet Miers '</ENAMEX> views /.
The answer to that is going to be exactly what you just said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> /.
What 's going to come out after all this and it will probably not take a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> hearing to do this is that they talked about that she 's a woman of sincere faith and keep that in mind /.
I I 'd like to know that though I g- -- I got to tell you /.
look I I think that 's what we 're going to hear whether that 's actually what was said or not said because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dobson</ENAMEX> sure made it sound like he 's got more than that /.
Oh sure /.
and there 's -- the investigators will find that out /.
But an- and uh that 's why /.
Well that 's exactly -- well that 's exactly right /.
he did /.
and that 's why you need to find that out /.
Well look I I know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> /.
I I know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Dobson</ENAMEX> /.
I 'll tell you one thing /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Dobson</ENAMEX> is going to tell the truth /.
All right no I 'm n- not questioning /.
no no /-
and and no let me be clear /.
I 'm not -- and I 'm not questioning -- I 'm n- -- I did n't mean to be suggesting he 's not going to tell the truth /.
Well and I think -- but here 's what you do /.
you ask the question /.
that 's what investigators do sure /.
I 'm saying that 's what we 're going to to get from the investigation etcetera /.
All right <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Sekulow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliot Minkford</ENAMEX> thanks a lot /.
appreciate it /. /.
Coming up , the families of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> people allegedly murdered by a convicted sex offender will sue another county for letting him out on bail /.
As sad as it is as a legal matter I 'm not sure they 've got a case /.
Coming up /.
We 're back with the horrible story of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Duncan</ENAMEX> charged with bludgeoning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brenda Groney</ENAMEX> her <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">thirteen year old</ENAMEX> son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slade</ENAMEX> and boyfriend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark McKenzie</ENAMEX> to death and then accused also of kidnapping <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaste</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylan</ENAMEX> and molesting them repeatedly over almost <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven weeks</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaste</ENAMEX> eventually found in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> in a diner with her alleged captor /.
and just days later <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylan</ENAMEX> 's remains discovered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Montana</ENAMEX> woods /.
Well now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brenda Groney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark McKenzie</ENAMEX> 's families are preparing a lawsuit claiming a judge prosecutors and law enforcement authorities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Becker County Minnesota</ENAMEX> are responsible for letting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duncan</ENAMEX> out on bail when they should have known he was a violent sex offender and they should have known he 'd likely offend again /.
I 'm h- m- -- I fear they do n't have a legal leg to stand on /.
Here 's what we know /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March of this year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duncan</ENAMEX> 's charged with molesting <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> boys in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Minnesota</ENAMEX> /.
He was already a registered sex offender having served almost <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> decades for the violent rape of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen year old</ENAMEX> boy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Washington state</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April fifth</ENAMEX> voluntarily goes to court after receiving a summons /.
he 's released on <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">fifteen thousand dollars</ENAMEX> bail /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> condition he had to have weekly contact with probation /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April eighteenth</ENAMEX> last time probation hears from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duncan</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May third</ENAMEX> probation tells the county authority <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duncan</ENAMEX> 's disappeared /.
and on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May fifteenth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brenda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slade Groney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark McKenzie</ENAMEX> were murdered in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Idaho</ENAMEX> /.
My take /.
My regular viewers know how angry this case made me /.
In addition to my fury at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duncan</ENAMEX> I became furious at all the finger pointing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Minnesota</ENAMEX> /.
But the bottom line is the law in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Minnesota</ENAMEX> allowed for bail /.
He paid cash /.
If the bail had been higher he could have still put uh part of the money down and been released /.
It would n't have changed anything /.
The law in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Minnesota</ENAMEX> needs to be changed /.
but I 'm afraid that this lawsuit 's going to get thrown out /.
But joining me now is the attorney who is going to be representing the familes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brenda Groney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark McKenzie</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell Vancamp</ENAMEX> /.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vancamp</ENAMEX> thank you very much for uh taking the time /.
What am I what am I getting wrong here as a legal matter do you think /?
Well you know in our system of justice in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> things can be changed /.
and it takes these people these people that have suffered this horrendous horrendous situation /.
but this is the kind of case that can change the law or change how sex offenders are treated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> /.
We 've got to do something /.
and the time is now /.
Look I I agree with you /.
Look as you know twice a show we put out the pictures of wanted sex offenders uh who have not reported to the authorities in the hope that we can help in that effort /.
But as legal matter you would concede would you not that that typically this kind of lawsuit would be thrown out /?
I do n't concede anything number one /.
and this is not a typical lawsuit /.
so you ca n't say typical /.
not doing something for not doing more etcetera when the result was horrible generally would be thrown out /.
Absolutely not /.
not generally /.
When you have a such a horrific uh situation as this uh the law takes a closer look at it /.
In fact there could be some federal laws that have been violated here /.
so I feel that uh there uh that they need to take care of it /.
and n- and in m- -- and in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Minnesota</ENAMEX> they need to take care of it now /.
How is the lawsuit viewed differently as a legal matter based on how horrific the crime was /?
Now remember /.
this is not a lawsuit yet /.
it 's a tort claim /.
But when it shocks the conscience of the average person /.
and any any normal human bead would be -- human being would be shocked by what happened here and how easy it would have been for uh the uh responsible authorities to look back at a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five year</ENAMEX> history of this devil incarnate and uh not let him loose /.
and this situation would not have happened /.
The family wants to stop this for the future /.
that 's what they want to do /.
Is there a danger that if if lawsuits like this succeed that that basically any time a uh public official does something uh acts in a particular way or does n't act that if something horrible happens later that person will be held civily responsible /?
Well in this type of case especially now /-
Remember /.
back in the old days the king could do no wrong /.
Well in this case the king did wrong /.
and through their neglegence uh we lost human lives /.
and then horrendous things happened to little kids /.
and uh th- this is the kind of case that 's an exception to that kind of generalization that you talk about /.
An- and you think it 's fair then to say that y- you blame the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> authorities for everything that happened here /?
We blame the responsible hired employees of this county to do their job correctly and do it right and not just go through every day on a rote type situation /.
This is not that type of situation /.
There 's got to be some accountability /.
and there 's got to be accountability for the future /.
And when you say accountability you 're not talking about /-
I mean we all would blame <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duncan</ENAMEX> /.
but you 're also saying that the the county in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> is responsible for these deaths /.
Uh in a legal sense they 're responsible /.
They let him out /.
This guy should have never been let out and should have never been given a bond /.
and had they done their job right back there and had uh in- invesigated it properly in this information age that we we have it is my opinion and the families ' opinion this would have not happened /.
But we want to stop this from happening in the future /.
Yeah well look I think we uh we all do /.
and uh you know I I do n't -- uh I do n't fault you for giving it a try /.
I think you got a very difficult legal uh challenge ahead of you /.
but I think you 're doing it for the right reasons /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell Vancamp</ENAMEX> thanks very much for taking the time /.
Thank you /.
Coming up , do n't let those on the far right tell you they do n't have a litmus test for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> nominees /.
Take one look at how they 're reacting to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harriet Miers</ENAMEX> /.
and you 'll see what it is /.
Either you agree with them /.
or you 're out /.
and keep in mind when it came to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> some on the left did the same thing /.
I 'm tired of it /.
My closing argument /.
And our continuing series <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose</ENAMEX> our effort to find sex offenders before they strike /.
This week we 're focusing on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> /.
Authorities need your finding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clifford Willard</ENAMEX> convicted of lewd acts with a child under the age of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen</ENAMEX> /.
He 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five eight</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one fifty</ENAMEX> has not registered with the authorities /.
If you got any information on his whereabouts please call the department uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the California Department of Justice</ENAMEX> nine one six two two seven four nine seven four /.
Back in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">minute</ENAMEX> /.
Closing argument /.
It 's time to blow through the smoke screens created by many opposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harriet Miers '</ENAMEX> nomination to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> /.
It 's actually quite easy to do /.
The far right is afraid she 's not far enough to the right /.
and they want proof period /.
Do n't believe those who say there 's no litmus test /.
Of course there is /.
If you do n't want to overturn <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Roe v Wade</ENAMEX> , if you do n't want to limit the rights of gays and if you do n't want to allow more religion in public buildings and schools then they do n't want you on the court period /.
Your qualifications quote end quote meaningless /.
Now apart from the handful of law professors and legal scholars almost all of those who at this time are claiming she 's not qualified are just looking for an excuse /.
I assure you the vast majority of them would welcome a poorly qualified but guaranteed hardcore conservative /.
The far right is only resorting to talk about her judicial experience and qualifications because they want someone with experience that proves she 'll vote their way not because they truly are concerned about her ability to value uh evaluate constitutional issues /.
It 's almost humorous to hear some of the same people who regularly mock the so called elite point out that her law school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SMU</ENAMEX> is not among the nation 's most respected /.
Now some on the left engaged in a similar type of dishonest attack during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Roberts '</ENAMEX> confirmation process /.
They could n't hide behind the cloak of inadequate qualifications /.
After all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvard</ENAMEX> law grad had worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> repatedly argued in front of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> and had served as a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> judge /.
So instead the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty two</ENAMEX> senators who opposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> claimed that they could n't vote for him because they did n't know enough about him or said he had n't answered their questions /.
The reality they could n't be assured he would not vote with the conservative justices on many of the same controversial issues in particular <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Roe v Wade</ENAMEX> /.
Since when are senators entitled to guarantees about how a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> justice will rule /?
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> 's constitutional role of advise and consent is rapidly disintegrating into one of advocate and confront /.
I 'll say it again /.
We can not let the fringes on both sides hijack the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> nomination process /.
But it 's even more insulting and dangerous when they are n't straight with us about what they 're saying and why they 're saying it /.
Coming up the terror alert in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">New York City</ENAMEX> now over /.
Some of you come to the defense of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> officials criticized for going public about questionable threats /.
Your emails next /.
I 've had my say /.
now it 's time for your rebuttal /.
Many of you writing in about the terror threats on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">New York City</ENAMEX> subway system and fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New york</ENAMEX> was taking it more seriously than the feds /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Kissler</ENAMEX> /.
Let me get this straight /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Homeland security</ENAMEX> ie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FEMA</ENAMEX> condemned the mayor of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">New Orleans</ENAMEX> /.
and now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Homeland Security</ENAMEX> 's condemning the Mayor of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">New York</ENAMEX> for overreacting /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Morris</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Socrates New York</ENAMEX> /.
The source for this latest is saying <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jihadists</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> are coming to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">NYC</ENAMEX> for an attack on the subway system /.
If this is true does n't this contradict that we are now safer that for invading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> rhetoric <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the White House</ENAMEX> has been saying for a long time now /?
Tabs Rush /.
all I 've heard is skepticism about the threat /.
If it happens then you want to blame <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> for not acting /.
If he does he 's trying to walk the dog /.
I believe the term is wag the dog /.
but I get your point /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PJ Williamson</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Tennessee</ENAMEX> /.
After the way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Homeland Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FEMA</ENAMEX> performed during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Katrina</ENAMEX> do we really trust their opinion /?
I trust the local officials much more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> jokers /.
Finally <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherry Sharrows</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Belleville Illinois</ENAMEX> /.
Call me a cynic /.
but every time the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration get into trouble we get a terror alert /.
Coincidence I do n't think so /.
Your emails <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Abrams Report</ENAMEX> one word at MSNBC dot com /.
