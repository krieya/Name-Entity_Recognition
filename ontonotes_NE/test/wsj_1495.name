<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Baltimore</ENAMEX> , who has just been named president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller University</ENAMEX> , already knows what it 's like to go through life with `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> laureate '' appended to one 's name .
He is currently experiencing what it 's like to have the phrase , `` under investigation for scientific fraud , '' also attached to his name .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> committee made the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> addition ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell 's</ENAMEX> congressional committee created the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> .
Both of Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baltimore</ENAMEX> 's public faces have been on view <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few weeks</ENAMEX> while he was under consideration to succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua Lederberg</ENAMEX> as head of the prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> research institution .
It came to light that a substantial number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> 's faculty were upset over or even opposed to Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baltimore</ENAMEX> 's impending appointment .
They were disturbed at what they regarded as Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baltimore</ENAMEX> 's confrontational attitude toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> committee , which held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who had co-authored a scientific paper with Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baltimore</ENAMEX> .
Readers of these columns -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Science Police</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May 15</ENAMEX> -RRB- will recall that Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baltimore</ENAMEX> was merely the most well - known part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> committee 's larger investigation , which touched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MIT</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tufts</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Duke</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> and elsewhere .
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> even managed to enlist the services of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Secret Service</ENAMEX> in his investigation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baltimore</ENAMEX> paper .
Insofar as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> has a special interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NIH</ENAMEX> and the institutions that receive its funding , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> scientists were no doubt discomfited by Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baltimore</ENAMEX> 's unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron , whose behavior reminded Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baltimore</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCarthy</ENAMEX> era .
This well may be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time that the venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller University</ENAMEX> has brushed up publicly against the intimidations <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">now</ENAMEX> common in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> science .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell</ENAMEX> demagogues <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a David Baltimore</ENAMEX> , animal - rights activists do <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.5 million</ENAMEX> of damage to labs at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.Cal - Davis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meryl Streep</ENAMEX> decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremy Rifkin</ENAMEX> files lawsuits in federal court to thwart biotech experiments , and Dutch - elm - disease researcher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Strobel</ENAMEX> 's own colleagues at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Montana State</ENAMEX> denounce him for `` violating '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EPA</ENAMEX> rules .
Scientists are mistaken who still think that the anti-science movement in this country is n't their concern or that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a David Baltimore</ENAMEX> could have somehow placated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a John Dingell</ENAMEX> .
-LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> , by the way , has decreed another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NIH</ENAMEX> investigation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baltimore</ENAMEX> paper , adding to several previous investigations .
Something other than what most scientists would recognize as the truth is being sought here . -RRB-
Fortunately , there are signs that increasing numbers of scientists understand the necessity of speaking out .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hubel</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> laureate at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvard</ENAMEX> , has taken the lead in defending research with animals , as has Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael DeBakey</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> defended itself vigorously and successfully against a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rifkin</ENAMEX> suit to block the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> launch .
Scientists need to understand that while they tend to believe their work is primarly about establishing new knowledge or doing good , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> it is also about power .
In a media - linked world , scientists may earn wide praise and even <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobels</ENAMEX> for their work , but they also attract the attention of people who wish to gain control over the content , funding and goals of that work .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a David Baltimore</ENAMEX> -- or the next target -- decides it is better to stand up to these forces , his fellow scientists would do well to recognize what is fundamentally at stake , and offer their public support .
