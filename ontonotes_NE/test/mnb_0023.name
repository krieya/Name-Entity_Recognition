Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> do n't yet have a really good picture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Bush</ENAMEX> .
To discuss the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> lady , we are rejoined by our panel .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> , why do n't you take a whack at this .
Have you ever met her ?
No , I have n't .
I think it is clear , though , from watching her throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year and a half</ENAMEX> she is more of the traditional mold of predecessors of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> than like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> .
She is not going to try to break the mold like Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> did by taking an active role in policy making .
A lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> were uncomfortable with that and I think ended up being a mistake .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce</ENAMEX> , it looks like you want to say something .
I quibble with the idea she is of another generation .
Not every wife necessarily wants to be in politics just because her husband is in politics .
That does n't make her a throwback .
I think , I believe it is probably true , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> also learned in time that it is n't a good idea for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> lady to become too identified with specific policy initiates , at least publicly .
I think she herself pulled back on that .
Well , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah</ENAMEX> , let's us pay proper respect .
She is a teacher and cares about something tremendously important to this country , literacy .
Exactly .
She has worked hard on this issue .
She will tackle the issue the same way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Bush</ENAMEX> did , encouraging reading .
I 'm sure she will have programs and initiatives .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> did a lot of things too .
She is out with another book , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Entertaining at the White House and Redecorating the White House</ENAMEX> .
Doing what we think of as more traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> lady things can be very , very effective .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah</ENAMEX> , you remember that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> chafed at the idea of being in the traditional role .
She was not at all happy about it .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> campaign she talked about having to bake cookies .
She was n't pleased with that .
That is right .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce</ENAMEX> makes a good point , too .
After health care reform failed , he changed her steages a bit .
She pulled back .
She began doing more traditional things in public , whereas in private she did still work on the causes she cared about , she advocated and lobbied in a quiet , behind the scenes way .
She did n't make a big deal out of being a co-president anymore .
That is exactly my point , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> wants to deal with policy .
She loves that and is steeped in it .
Clearly Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> does n't want to go down that road .
It depends .
Literacy is a big problem in this country .
Nothing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Bush</ENAMEX> did or said , with due respect , addressed it in an important way .
It was more of a show .
What needs to be done about literacy is to spend a lot of money , which President - elect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> proposed .
That was a large spending program , a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion</ENAMEX> literacy program .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Bush</ENAMEX> could be a big help with that , not like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> with health care , but a symbol with teachers , librarians , people who care about reading and believe every <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> should be able to read and put clout behind it .
In that way she could be a great asset .
It is a policy that is very hard to disagree with .
She could be the symbol of really doing something .
Let us hope so .
Thank you for talking to us .
