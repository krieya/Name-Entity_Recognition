A return to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> - era symbolism in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> is gaining favor .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Duma</ENAMEX> , the lower house of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> parliament , has voted to adopt the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> national anthem as the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> anthem .
The song now in use was introduced in 1993 .
The issue sparked demonstrations , pitting supporters against those who fiercely oppose a connection with what they consider a murderous regime .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Upper House</ENAMEX> must next approve the measure .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Putin</ENAMEX> has pledged his support , but has called for different lyrics .
