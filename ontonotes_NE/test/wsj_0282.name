<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Myung Moon</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Korean</ENAMEX> evangelist - industrialist who in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</ENAMEX> founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Unification Church</ENAMEX> , remains the mystery man behind a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">multimillion - dollar</ENAMEX> political and publishing operation based in this country and catering to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> right .
But there may be less there than meets the eye .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> planned to convert <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> to his unique brand of Christianity -- in which he plays the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Testament</ENAMEX> - style temporal , political messiah -- and then to make the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> part of a unified international theocracy .
His original strategy -LRB- in itself a brilliant innovation for spreading a religion -RRB- was to create new economic enterprises each time he wanted to extend and fund his various religious missions .
Tax - exempt airport and street - corner solicitations were intended only to provide start - up funds .
More stable industries were to build an economically viable infrastructure for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> movement in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">North America</ENAMEX> , as they had in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> .
Then he would move his movement to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> .
But that was not to be .
Throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1970s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1980s</ENAMEX> spokesmen for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Unification Church</ENAMEX> and its opponents in the anticult movement gave wildly exaggerated membership figures .
Their legacy lives on .
It is still common to read in the press that the church has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000 or more</ENAMEX> full - time <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> members and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,000</ENAMEX> `` associates . ''
Some estimates have gone <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as high as 80,000</ENAMEX> members .
But internal church documents clearly show that at its publicity - seeking heights , as when it organized a spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yankee Stadium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">bicentennial</ENAMEX> rally in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</ENAMEX> , there actually were <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 2,000</ENAMEX> full - time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Unification Church</ENAMEX> members in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> 's support for a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> - beleaguered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Koreagate</ENAMEX> scandal , and his prison sentence for income - tax evasion did not help the church 's recruitment efforts .
Defections , burnouts , and abduction `` deprogrammings '' kept member turnover high .
That the membership number has even kept close to its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</ENAMEX> size is the result of the `` graying '' of the church .
Many of the enthusiastic young `` Moonies '' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> era who remained faithful to Father <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> are now parents , producing new members by procreation rather than conversion .
The reputed wealth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Unification Church</ENAMEX> is another matter of contention .
For a while in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</ENAMEX> it seemed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> was on a spending spree , with such purchases as the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New Yorker Hotel</ENAMEX> and its adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Manhattan Center</ENAMEX> ; a fishing / processing conglomerate with branches in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> ; a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christian Brothers</ENAMEX> monastery and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Seagram</ENAMEX> family mansion -LRB- both picturesquely situated on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Hudson River</ENAMEX> -RRB- ; shares in banks from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uruguay</ENAMEX> ; a motion picture production company , and newspapers , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Washington Times</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York City Tribune</ENAMEX> -LRB- originally <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the News World</ENAMEX> -RRB- , and the successful <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> - language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Noticias del Mundo</ENAMEX> .
Yet these purchases can be misleading .
Most were obtained with huge inputs of church money from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , minimum cash downpayments and sizable mortgages .
Those teams of young fund - raisers selling flowers , peanuts or begging outright at traffic intersections brought in somewhere near <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</ENAMEX> a year during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid - to - late 1970s</ENAMEX> , but those revenues were a pittance compared to the costs of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> 's lavish international conferences , speaking tours , and assorted land buys .
Only his factories in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> , employing his followers at subsistence wages and producing everything from rifles to ginseng to expensive marble vases , kept the money flowing westward .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Virginia Commonwealth University</ENAMEX> sociologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Bromley</ENAMEX> , who more than any other researcher has delved into the complex world of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Unificationist</ENAMEX> finances , has concluded that profitable operations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> have been the exceptions rather than the rule .
Likewise , journalists <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Burgess</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Isikoff</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Washington Post</ENAMEX> have estimated that <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 800 million</ENAMEX> was transferred from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> to deal with the church 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> operating losses in this country .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> - language <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> newspapers illustrate the scope of this financial drain .
Start - up costs for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Washington Times</ENAMEX> alone were <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $ 50 million</ENAMEX> , and the total amount lost in this journalistic black hole was estimated at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> .
Since then , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> 's organization has inaugurated a pair of high - quality glossy opinion magazines , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The World and I</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Insight</ENAMEX> , which are a further drain .
Insiders say that not even their editors know for sure how much these show - piece publications , along with the newspapers , have cost Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> .
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> church - owned businesses , such as a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</ENAMEX> factory to build fishing vessels , are defunct .
Some components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> church had their budgets cut in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> and again <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
The relatively small academic conferences that have attracted conservative guests -- and press scrutiny -- in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> are much more narrowly targeted and austere than the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</ENAMEX> - person get - togethers in fancy digs and exotic locales of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years past</ENAMEX> .
I attended several of these in the dual role as a presenter of research findings as well as an investigator of my hosts .
-LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paragon House</ENAMEX> eventually even published <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> of my co-edited books on religion and politics . -RRB-
According to veteran watchers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Unificationist</ENAMEX> affairs , such as Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Gordon Melton</ENAMEX> , director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Institute for the Study of American Religion</ENAMEX> , almost all operations are being drastically reduced as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> now concentrates more on developing his empire in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Far East</ENAMEX> .
`` Everything , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> non - `` Moonie '' senior consultant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Unification Church</ENAMEX> recently told me in an interview , `` is going back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> . ''
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> had proved even less hospitable than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">North America</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> politicians were less reluctant to have their governments investigate and harass new religions . -RRB-
So Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> is in retreat , refocusing on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Far East</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> continue to be profitable .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tong'Il</ENAMEX> industry conglomerate is now investing heavily in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , where church accountants have high hopes of expanding and attracting converts even in the wake of the bloody massacre in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Panda Motors</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> such investment .
According to senior consultants to the church , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> has successfully negotiated a joint venture with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> government to build an automobile - parts plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong Province</ENAMEX> , an area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> with a substantial <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Korean</ENAMEX> minority .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> has agreed to put up <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</ENAMEX> a year for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years</ENAMEX> and keep the profits in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
In return , he has the government 's blessing to build churches and spread Unificationism in that country .
Whatever respectability and ties to intellectuals and opinion - makers the publications and conferences bring really are salvage -- not the Rev. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> 's original final goals , but the ones for which he will have to settle .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shupe</ENAMEX> is co-author -LRB- with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David G. Bromley</ENAMEX> -RRB- of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">` Moonies ' in America : Cult , Church , and Crusade</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Strange Gods : The Great American Cult Scare</ENAMEX> .
