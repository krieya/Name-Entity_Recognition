For all of this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> 's explosive run - up in stock prices , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance Investment Management Inc. 's</ENAMEX> computer sat on the sidelines .
Now it 's on the fence .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> - based money manager , began buying stocks again <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 billion</ENAMEX> that it oversees for clients , according to people familiar with the firm 's revised strategy .
It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> has thought stocks are worth owning .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> declined to confirm the move , but its stock purchases were thought to have begun <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> , timed to coincide with the maturity <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills owned by the firm .
The other <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> of its portfolio is expected to remain invested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills for the time being .
Wall Street executives said they believed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 900 million</ENAMEX> buy program was carried out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber Inc</ENAMEX> .
As reported , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> bought shares <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> as part of a customer strategy shift , although the broker 's client was said then to have been <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> declined comment .
When it owns stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> 's portfolio typically is composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 60</ENAMEX> large - capitalization issues ; to make buy or sell moves , the firm solicits Wall Street brokerage houses a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> or so in advance , looking for the best package price to carry out the trades .
The broker winning the business does n't charge commissions , but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price .
That puts the broker at risk if it 's trying to buy stock in a rising market .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> 's gyrating session , the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</ENAMEX> points <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early in the day</ENAMEX> , but finished with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than a four</ENAMEX> - point loss .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> 's last portfolio shift , carried out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Goldman , Sachs -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , was a highly publicized decision <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last January</ENAMEX> to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills .
The sell signal , which sent a bearish chill through the stock market , came when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> 's computer found that stocks were overpriced compared with bonds and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills .
At the time , the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at about 2200 .
The Dow average now stands <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</ENAMEX> higher , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> 's portfolio of Treasurys produced a return of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 6 %</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first three quarters of the year</ENAMEX> .
The computer 's miscalculation has been painful for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> .
Almost any money manager holding stocks has turned in better results , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> has played it safe with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills .
So why does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> 's computer like stocks with the Dow at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2653.28</ENAMEX> , where it closed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , when it did n't with the Dow at 2200 ?
`` With the decline in stock prices and continued low or stable interest rates , stocks are representing a better value all the time , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank W. Terrizzi</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Three - month</ENAMEX> T - bill yields have fallen to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.8 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9 %</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of the year</ENAMEX> .
Stock prices , meanwhile , are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 140</ENAMEX> points lower than the peak of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2791.41</ENAMEX> reached on the Dow industrial average <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 9</ENAMEX> .
Are those declines enough to signal a partial return to stocks ?
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terrizzi</ENAMEX> wo n't say specifically , explaining that if there was such a move , it would take <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about three days</ENAMEX> to complete the loose ends of the transaction .
During that time , a buyer with the clout of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> could end up driving up the price of stocks it was trying to buy if it tipped its hand .
But everything is relative to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terrizzi</ENAMEX> , so stocks in his view can become more attractive in comparison with bonds or T - bills , even if shares are more expensive than when they were sold in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> .
`` Our -LCB- computer -RCB- model has a certain trigger point , '' he said .
When the computer says switch , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> switches .
The firm has made <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> previous shifts from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> type of asset to another in its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> history .
Almost all have involved <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least half</ENAMEX> and often the firm 's entire portfolio , as the computer searches for the most undervalued investment category , following a money - management style called tactical asset allocation .
Competing asset - allocation firms march to their own computer models , so some have been partly or fully invested in stocks <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> has sat on the sidelines .
As a result , competitors say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> has been looking for any opportunity to return to the stock market , rather than risk losing business by continuing to remain fully invested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terrizzi</ENAMEX> confirms some clients have left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> , but no major ones , and the firm has added new accounts .
