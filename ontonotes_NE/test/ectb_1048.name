-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Wen - ting</ENAMEX> / illustrations courtesy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia Yang</ENAMEX> / tr. by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher</ENAMEX>
The winner of the prize for fine art in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Culture and Arts Foundation Awards</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the highest honors for an artist in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> - was contemporary painter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia Yang</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> became a leading light on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> art scene back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</ENAMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the " <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</ENAMEX> Great Outlaws " who launched the island 's modern art movement .
Since then his artistic vocation has taken him around the world , and he has at last ended up back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
What is it that distinguishes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> 's work and that marked him out for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the National Arts and Culture award</ENAMEX> , and what kind of contribution has he made to contemporary art in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> ?
Friendly and relaxed by nature , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia Yang</ENAMEX> does n't seem overly excited about winning <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the National Culture and Arts Award</ENAMEX> .
If anything it is his friends who are happiest , relieved to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> gaining deserved recognition for the achievements of his peripatetic , ill - starred life .
Lonely start in life
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia Tzu - hsiang</ENAMEX> , as he was then named , was born into a literary family in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hunan Province</ENAMEX> .
Fate robbed him of his mother within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</ENAMEX> of his birth , and of his father when he was just <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four</ENAMEX> .
His grandmother took him to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sichuan</ENAMEX> to escape the war , and they returned <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years later</ENAMEX> to find the family home in ruins .
When he was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nine</ENAMEX> his grandmother died and he was entrusted to a great aunt .
She in turn died when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">13</ENAMEX> , after which he went to live with an uncle and aunt in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hankou</ENAMEX> .
They wanted to send him to join his elder brother in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Changsha</ENAMEX> , but his brother did n't have the means to take care of him either .
At the age of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">16</ENAMEX> , after years of being passed from pillar to post , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> joined the army - where at least he knew that he 'd get fed .
" It was a big clan , and it just fell apart ! " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> with a rueful smile , the expression of one who has seen life and holds few illusions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> joined up in the year that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nationalist</ENAMEX> forces retreated from the mainland , and soon found himself in a desk job at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Air Force General HQ</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
By coincidence , the dormitory bunk above his was occupied by another aspiring painter , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Hao</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> became firm friends and began to take classes under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Chung - sheng</ENAMEX> , the doyen of modern art in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Antung Street Studio</ENAMEX> they teamed up with a group of like - minded young painters , including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ouyang Wen - yuan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huo Kang</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsiao Chin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Yuan - chia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Tao - ming</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsiao Ming - hsien</ENAMEX> .
Together they formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ton - Fan Group</ENAMEX> , and eventually they became known as the " <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</ENAMEX> Great Outlaws " of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> modern art .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> recalls , the main incentive for studying under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Chung - sheng</ENAMEX> was that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX> 's fees were relatively affordable .
Other painters charged upwards of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">45 yuan</ENAMEX> per month , with fees at studios run by older , more established <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> artists reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">60 or 70 yuan</ENAMEX> .
No amount of scrimping and saving was going to put that within reach of someone like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> , getting by on a military allowance of just <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 yuan</ENAMEX> per month .
The only choice was <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Antung Street Studio</ENAMEX> , where the monthly fee was just <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 yuan</ENAMEX> .
Rescuing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> art
The economic constraints and repressive censorship of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the era</ENAMEX> did nothing to deter these young art fiends .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> recalls , the only art materials they could get hold of were red and black ink , courtesy of the military , and pencils .
Sometimes they mixed the ink with glue to produce an oil - paint texture .
Scraping together the money for just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> tube of oil paint involved considerable effort , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> remembers repeatedly uncapping that single tube to breathe in the lovely scent of linseed oil .
The painters took turns taking off their shirts to model for each other , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> would sometimes spend <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the whole day</ENAMEX> sketching customers at the ice - cream shop by the train station , after paying for a single slice of watermelon .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</ENAMEX> , against the advice of their teacher and clueless about the risks involved in starting up a new organization -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> was under martial law at the time -RRB- , the young artists formed themselves into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ton - Fan Group</ENAMEX> .
People flocked to buy tickets for the exhibition that they mounted at a venue in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chunghua Road</ENAMEX> , but many visitors found that the art was not to their liking .
Some , feeling " cheated , " flung their exhibition leaflets on the floor in disgust .
" They cost <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">50 cents</ENAMEX> each to produce ! " exclaims <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> , still bemoaning the waste .
Raising the banner of reform , the Outlaws issued a declaration forecasting <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> art 's inevitable decline if it stayed stuck in the past .
Only through the introduction of modern forms of expression from the outside world , they said , could the boundless resources of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's art tradition be revitalized .
The declaration , which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> drafted , shows that the group 's objective was to modernize <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> art by drawing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> artistic concepts and methods into the production of essentially <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> works .
This insistence on the " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> " element has been a hallmark of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia Yang 's</ENAMEX> art ever since .
Outlaws around the world
From paintings of his done during that early period , one sees how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> rendered human figures using the thick lines of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> folk painting , but proceeded to dissect and reassemble those figures in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> , mechanistic fashion .
In his painting <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Flying Apsaras</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> brings a modern geometrical approach to the traditional image of airborne <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Buddhist</ENAMEX> spirits .
Critic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Chia - chi</ENAMEX> describes these divine beings shown wafting through a void of blank space as " kind of surreal . . . like astronauts in a state of weightlessness . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> has also produced a number of purely abstract works , drawing on his deep familiarity with that most important element of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> art - the use of line .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsiao Chin</ENAMEX> went to study in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> , becoming the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ton - Fan Group</ENAMEX> to go overseas .
He wrote back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> describing the new trends in art that he was witness to , and the other painters , after poring over the contents of his densely written airmail letters , began putting some of those ideas into practice .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> was very cut off from the world in those days , and those studying art naturally wanted to see for themselves what was happening elsewhere .
In their letters to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsiao</ENAMEX> , all the others , including their teacher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Chung - sheng</ENAMEX> , asked about the cost of living overseas .
One by one , each member of the group set off on his own modern art pilgrimage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia Yang</ENAMEX> , for whom <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> was the art center of the world , made his move in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</ENAMEX> , traveling by ship from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Keelung</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and from there on to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> .
The cost of his <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - way ticket was borne by his colleague at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Air Force HQ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Chuan - jen</ENAMEX> , who generously put his entire savings of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 5,000</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> 's disposal .
On the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> stopped off in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsiao Chin</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> remembers that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsiao</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> words on meeting were : " Come on , let 's paint . "
For someone like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> , orphaned early and shunted for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> among various relatives , the support and affection of his friends has played a particularly important part in his life .
Fuzzy people , floating people
During his <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - and - a - half years</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> lived in a tiny garret in the red light district with barely enough room to stand up in .
He supported himself doing miscellaneous jobs , working on people 's houses and restoring furniture .
Times were tough , but it was during this period that he found what he had been probing for in his use of line , and started on the " fuzzy people " phase of his output .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> 's fuzzy people were born into his work as if by a natural process .
While experimenting with a tangle of lines <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> found unidentifiable clusters taking shape , from which human forms began to emerge .
" This was something I really knew I could work with , " recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> .
It was a case of " seizing that special thing of your own , " which for an artist is of the utmost importance .
Like a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taoist</ENAMEX> priest painting magic symbols , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> uses line to create human figures and the written word to invoke power .
With rapid , sweeping strokes of the brush he creates fluid , free - floating figures , without faces or personalities , performing their allotted roles in the midst of a coldly linear realm .
The resulting images reflect the alienation of modern life , conveying a sense of illusion and impermanence .
It has been suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia Yang</ENAMEX> himself , the lifelong drifter , is the prototype for these blurry beings .
But then again , which of us is not in transit , drifting through this brief existence ?
" As the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> say , man is a passenger through life who is gone in an instant .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia Yang 's</ENAMEX> fuzzy people exist very much within this <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Eastern</ENAMEX> philosophical context . "
So says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fu Shen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the judges in the fine arts category for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Culture and Arts Foundation</ENAMEX> awards .
While he was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> received a letter from a friend in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> saying : " Life is easier here . "
Soon afterwards he moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , renting a cheap loft in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">SoHo</ENAMEX> and supporting himself as a furniture restorer .
Photorealism was the vogue in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> painting at the time .
It did n't appeal to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> , but he knew he had to learn something in his new country of residence , and at the same time he needed to produce work that was commercially viable .
He began employing photographic effects , for example depicting a crowd of passersby on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> street as a speeding blur .
His work now became populated with " floating people " of this kind , although in spirit they were still the fuzzy people of his earlier period .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> spent over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , painting in the cavernous gloom of his loft , eating <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> food and listening to traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> opera music .
The walls of the loft were pasted with simple verses , written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> in language that was part literary <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> and part colloquial .
" I was like a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> person dwelling in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> concession in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> with a laugh .
The biggest boon of living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> was that this was where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> met his wife <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Shuang - hsi</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> had grown up in a contented home never knowing poverty , and held a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">PhD</ENAMEX> in philosophy .
She met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> through the painter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsieh Li - fa</ENAMEX> , and since then the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of them have shared a simple and quiet life together .
" Feeling anxious when the old lady 's not here , and looking listlessly out the window / So bored of this dumb view , it 's much better when the silly little thing 's around . "
So runs one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> 's light - hearted couplets , testifying to the affection that unites these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> people who only came together relatively late in life .
Going home
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> , after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three decades</ENAMEX> away .
With a basic source of income guaranteed through an art - gallery contract , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> rented a spacious , light - filled <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> - story house in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peitou</ENAMEX> .
The new place was ideal for painting , but at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 35,000</ENAMEX> per month the rent was on the high side .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> 's " silly little " wife was in tears when it came to signing the lease , worrying that eventually they would n't be able to afford the rent .
Luckily Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Chih - wen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Institute of the Arts</ENAMEX> offered to support them to the tune of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 10,000</ENAMEX> per month for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first three years</ENAMEX> after their return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> and his wife were thus able to settle themselves down .
" At key moments , a little help from your friends can make all the difference , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> .
Financial help from his friends at such moments was what enabled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> to go abroad in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> place and then , eventually , to return again to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
This is something that the reserved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> has frequent cause to think about .
After returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia Yang</ENAMEX> reverted to painting fuzzy people .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> 's fuzzy people have taken on a number of different guises , be it as judges , singers , couples , beach babes or whatever .
They have mimicked famous icons of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> art such as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Mona Lisa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Millet</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Gleaners</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Botticelli</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Venus</ENAMEX> , and now the fuzzy family includes well - known figures from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Buddhist</ENAMEX> pantheon , part of a series of works that examines the role of religion in people 's lives .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia Yang</ENAMEX> , all characters are fair game for inclusion in his work , and all of them end up reverting to nothingness .
Fuzzy people stand up
Why is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> so into " fuzzy people , " and has he ever thought about trying something else ?
The painter points out that he ca n't predict what direction he may follow in the future , and says that if a new theme or style emerges it will be through a natural process , like the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> gave birth to the fuzzy people .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 2000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> 's fuzzy people at last " stood up " for themselves , becoming sculptures rather than just images on paper .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> was fiddling with an aluminum ring from a broken hair - dryer , shaping it into a little figure , when the idea dawned of doing fuzzy people in solid form .
By cutting and twisting pieces of copper , iron and steel , he was able to produce amusing little statuettes of his hitherto <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - dimensional fuzzy people .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> 's friends were not surprised by his move into sculpture , because he has always been good with his hands .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> he once made a hand - operated washing machine from a saucepan and several pieces of wood , and on another occasion he used the motor from an electric fan to power a self - adjusting easel .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> 's hands , all sorts of discarded objects , from sewing machines to camera lenses , are salvaged and put to good use .
" I 'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">the Leonardo da Vinci</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Orient</ENAMEX> , " chuckles <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> .
Returning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> has brought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> back into contact with the other " Outlaws " who used to dominate the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> art scene .
Of those , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Tao - ming</ENAMEX> has since given up art and gone into business , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Yuan - chia</ENAMEX> passed away in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ouyang Wen - yuan</ENAMEX> does n't paint any more because of psychological problems .
However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsiao Chin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Hao</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huo Kang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsiao Ming - hsien</ENAMEX> are all still active .
At a reunion <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsia</ENAMEX> declared proudly : " We 're the same merry band of rebels , still advancing as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> ! "
For artists to produce outstanding work they have to immerse themselves utterly in the act of creation .
These painters , remaining committed to the " pure " creative spirit and thoroughly loyal to the cause of art , are still the same old " outlaws " that they ever were .
