For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay Pacific Airways</ENAMEX> , the smooth ride may be ending .
The first signs of trouble came <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> carrier , a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Swire Pacific Ltd.</ENAMEX> , posted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> drop in operating profit for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first six months</ENAMEX> and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</ENAMEX> .
Securities analysts , many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> 's interim figures , believe more jolts lie ahead .
Fuel and personnel costs are rising , and tourism in and through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> remains clouded by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's turmoil since the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 4</ENAMEX> killings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
In addition , delivery delays for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 28</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">747 - 400s</ENAMEX> that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had been hired to man the planes .
And tough competition in the air - freight market is cutting into an important sideline .
There also is concern that once <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> reverts to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's sovereignty in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> will be forced to play <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> fiddle to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's often - disparaged flag carrier , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Civil Aviation Administration of China</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CAAC</ENAMEX> .
`` The sense is we would never be in a position again where everything works for us the way it did before , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rod Eddington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> 's commercial director .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah Hall</ENAMEX> , an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">James Capel -LRB- Far East -RRB- Ltd.</ENAMEX> , says there is n't much <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> can do about rising costs for jet <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">fuel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> tight labor market , or the strengthening of the local currency , which is pegged to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollar .
These factors are further complicated by the airline 's push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> says .
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> 's profit to grow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 13 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> and next .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , it earned <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.82 billion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 361.5 million</ENAMEX> -RRB- on revenue of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$ 11.79 billion</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> is taking several steps to bolster business .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> step is to beef up its fleet .
In addition to aircraft from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> announced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> an order for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 20</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Airbus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A330 - 300s</ENAMEX> .
The expansion , which could cost <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as US$ 5.7 billion</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next eight years</ENAMEX> , will expand the fleet to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 43</ENAMEX> planes by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of last year</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sun Hung Kai Securities Ltd</ENAMEX> .
The fuel - efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Airbus</ENAMEX> planes will be used largely to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> 's aging fleet of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lockheed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tristars</ENAMEX> for regional flights , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boeing</ENAMEX> aircraft will be used on long - haul routes to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">North America</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> also is moving some of its labor - intensive data - processing operations outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
Fierce bidding for young employees in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is pushing up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> 's labor costs by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</ENAMEX> a year for low - level staff , while experienced , skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain .
Some jobs already have been moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> , and there are plans to place others in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Bell</ENAMEX> , a spokesman for the airline , says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> is working to promote <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> as a destination worth visiting on its own merits , rather than just a stopover .
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 4</ENAMEX> killings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> have hurt its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> flights , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> 's other routes have retained high load factors .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> regards promoting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> as an important part of attracting visitors from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged .
There also has been speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> will be among the major private - sector participants in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> government 's plans to build a new airport , with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> officials decline to comment on the speculation .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> sees alliances with other carriers -- particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> 's recent link with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AMR Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Airlines</ENAMEX> -- as an important part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> 's strategy .
But he emphasizes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> carrier or with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> airline with which it has cooperated for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about a decade</ENAMEX> .
Analysts believe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> carriers .
`` We think alliances are very important , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> says .
`` But we 'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else 's .
I 'm not sure cross-ownership would necessarily make things smoother . ''
In a pattern it aims to copy in several key <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> destinations , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> recently announced plans to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> by flying into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Airlines '</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> carrier .
`` We 'll never have a big operation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , and they 'll never have one as big as us in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Pacific</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> says .
`` But this way , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American</ENAMEX> will coordinate good extensions to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> .
We 'll coordinate on this end to places like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> traffic , which currently accounts for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> 's business , is expected to continue as the carrier 's mainstay .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> has long stated its desire to double its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> flights into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</ENAMEX> , and it is applying to restart long - canceled flights into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> .
Further expansion into southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> is also possible , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bell</ENAMEX> , the spokesman .
While a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> companies have reincorporated offshore ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> , such a move is n't an option for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> because it would jeopardize its landing rights in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> emphatically rules out a move to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> : `` Our lifeblood is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> traffic rights . ''
He says the airline is putting its faith in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sino</ENAMEX> - British agreement on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
A special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> airlines , which include the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dragon Airlines</ENAMEX> , will continue to be negotiated by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> government .
But critics fret that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">post-1997</ENAMEX> officials ultimately will be responsible to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
`` My feeling is -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> does n't -RCB- have a hope in the long run , '' says an analyst , who declines to be identified .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cathay</ENAMEX> would love to keep going , but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sino</ENAMEX> - British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future .
`` We 're confident that it protects our route structure , '' he says , `` and our ability to grow and prosper .
