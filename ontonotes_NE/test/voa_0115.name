<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX> arrives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> for talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Putin</ENAMEX> on security , foreign policy , and economic issues .
They are also expected to discuss a new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> proposal for deep cuts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russian</ENAMEX> long - range missiles .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VOA</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry James</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> .
The highlight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one - day</ENAMEX> visit will be <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</ENAMEX> of talks on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> , during which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> will focus on a wide range of issues including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> 's latest call for cutting the number of strategic nuclear warheads to below <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1500</ENAMEX> .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has said such a deal is possible , but that it will be first necessary to convince <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> of the merits of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's proposed missile defense system .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> wants to amend the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</ENAMEX> anti-ballistic missile treaty so it can develop such a system .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> believes such a move could spark a new arms race and has threatened to tear up existing weapons agreements and stop disarmament talks if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> goes ahead .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> called on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> parliament to quickly ratify the amended <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty</ENAMEX> .
That treaty requires <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> to make further non-nuclear weapons reductions in some areas of the country including breakaway <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX> .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> acknowledged that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> is still violating its commitment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX> , but he said it is only a temporary situation which has the ultimate aim of cutting armaments in the region .
He also thanked the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</ENAMEX> other signatories to the treaty for their understanding .
He said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> is fully behind the agreement that , he said , is an efficient instrument of ensuring security in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> to come .
The original treaty was signed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> and led to the destruction of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of heavy weapons by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nato</ENAMEX> and the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warsaw Pact</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX> became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> leader to come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> to meet the new President <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last March</ENAMEX> even before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> was elected .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> leader returned the favor by making <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> one of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> foreign destinations after taking office .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> have already met <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> times <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
Analysts here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> believe <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> can play a useful role as a bridge to both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> .
Trade is also expected to figure significantly in the talks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> ranks as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> largest investor after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> with just <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">slightly more than $ 1 billion</ENAMEX> invested in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> .
