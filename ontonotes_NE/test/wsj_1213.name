After being whipsawed by a volatile stock market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds closed higher .
But junk bonds took more hits .
Early in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> , bond dealers said trading volume was heavy as large institutional investors scrambled to buy long - term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds on speculation that the stock market 's volatility would lead to a `` flight - to - quality '' rally .
That happens when nervous stock investors dump equities and buy Treasurys , which are higher in quality and thus considered safe .
`` Some retail accounts , such as commercial banks and pension funds , wanted to get on the bandwagon before it was too late , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sung Won Sohn</ENAMEX> , chief economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Norwest Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> point , the Dow Jones Industrial average fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 80</ENAMEX> points on news that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> decided to remain independent .
In response , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> prices soared <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1/8</ENAMEX> points , or <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 11.25</ENAMEX> for each $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> face amount .
But the gains in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds were pared as stocks staged a partial recovery .
The industrial average ended at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2659.22</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.69</ENAMEX> points .
Economists said the bond market 's strength also is a sign that investors expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to cut interest rates amid growing evidence that the economy is slowing .
While they do n't expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> to move right away , they say the case for lower rates is building .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commerce Department</ENAMEX> reported that new orders for durable goods fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</ENAMEX> , while the nation 's auto makers reported lackluster <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-October</ENAMEX> sales .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond ended <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1/4</ENAMEX> point higher .
Municipal , mortgage - backed and investment - grade corporate bonds rose <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/8</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</ENAMEX> point .
But high - yield , high - risk bonds fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/4</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</ENAMEX> point with the stock market early in the session and never recovered .
According to a trader at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> , the hardest hit junk bonds were those issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RJR Holdings Capital Corp.</ENAMEX> , which are the easiest to sell .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RJR</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.70 %</ENAMEX> bonds due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2007</ENAMEX> fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1/2</ENAMEX> points .
Trading activity in the junk market was extremely light as dealers could n't find enough buyers to match sellers .
`` While the stock market was falling , most -LCB- junk bond holders -RCB- were just watching it not knowing what to do , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Suckow</ENAMEX> , director of fixed - income securities at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Oppenheimer Management Corp</ENAMEX> .
`` It was like driving down the highway watching a wreck .
Everybody was rubber - necking . ''
Adding to the junk market 's jitters were reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Donaldson , Lufkin -AMP- Jenrette Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> is having trouble structuring a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6 billion</ENAMEX> offering for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TW Food Services Inc.</ENAMEX> and will postpone or even cancel the issue .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TW</ENAMEX> is the largest franchisee of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hardee 's</ENAMEX> , a fast - food restaurant , and operates several other food chains .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Donaldson Lufkin</ENAMEX> would n't comment .
Credit analysts said investors are nervous about the issue because they say the company 's ability to meet debt payments is dependent on too many variables , including the sale of assets and the need to mortgage property to retire some existing debt .
Also , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TW</ENAMEX> offering includes interest - deferred and pay - in - kind securities , which are currently unpopular .
Meanwhile , investors turned a cold shoulder to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</ENAMEX> of new <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> notes <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's not too surprising that the auction was sloppy , given the volatility in the bond market because of stocks , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert T. McGee</ENAMEX> , a senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tokai Bank Ltd</ENAMEX> .
`` People are looking past supply to lower interest rates , but they 're also worried about being whipsawed by the volatility in the stock market . ''
The new <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> notes were priced with an average yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.74 %</ENAMEX> .
That was higher than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.71 % to 7.73 %</ENAMEX> average yield that traders had expected .
In when - issued trading , the notes were quoted at a price to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.78 %</ENAMEX> .
Sluggish demand was also evidenced by the weak <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.41 - to - 1</ENAMEX> bid - to - cover ratio , which was lower than the average <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.79 - to - 1</ENAMEX> ratio at the last <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> similar auctions .
The ratio , which reflects the number of bids the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> receives for each bid accepted , is used to gauge investor demand .
Dealers said players shied away from the note sale because they were concerned that prices at the time of the auction might erode if the stock market staged a recovery , which , in fact , did happen .
Individual and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> participation in the auction was disappointing , according to dealers .
`` Interest by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investors was limited , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Moran</ENAMEX> , chief economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daiwa Securities America Inc</ENAMEX> .
`` They are typically not active in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> note auctions , but <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's participation could be viewed as lighter - than - normal . ''
However , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moran</ENAMEX> added that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> generally have a positive view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline .
He said , `` Possibly , they 're waiting to buy at the -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</ENAMEX> -RRB- refunding '' of government debt to be held <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> .
A trader at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> firm estimated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> purchased <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">no more than 10 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> notes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> , Agency Securities
Today investors will focus on the long - awaited auction of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.5 billion</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bonds by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Resolution Funding Corp</ENAMEX> .
The initial bond offering by the new government agency , which was created to help rescue the nation 's troubled thrifts , is n't expected to see robust demand .
A small yield premium over comparable Treasurys and a lack of liquidity is hampering dealers ' efforts to drum up interest in the so - called bailout bonds .
In when - issued trading , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Refcorp</ENAMEX> bonds were quoted at a price to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.17 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , the benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond was quoted late at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 18/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.89 %</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 9/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.93 %</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
The latest <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> was quoted at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 22/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.88 %</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 17/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.9 %</ENAMEX> .
Short - term rates were unchanged to slightly lower .
The discount rate on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - month</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills was quoted at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.52 %</ENAMEX> for a bond - equivalent yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.75 %</ENAMEX> , while the rate on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills was quoted at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.47 %</ENAMEX> for a yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.85 %</ENAMEX> .
Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it .
Corporate Issues
Several blue - chip companies tapped the new - issue market <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> to take advantage of falling interest rates .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> of the largest offerings , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Exxon Capital Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Xerox Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citicorp</ENAMEX> , were underwritten by groups led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salomon Brothers Inc</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Exxon Capital</ENAMEX> , long - rumored to be a potential debt issuer , offered <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> notes priced to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.31 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citicorp</ENAMEX> issued <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven - year</ENAMEX> notes priced to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.82 %</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Xerox</ENAMEX> priced <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - year</ENAMEX> notes to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.85 %</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> paved the way for a visit to the credit markets by filing a shelf registration with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 800 million</ENAMEX> in new debt .
This is in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> 's existing shelf registration under which <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</ENAMEX> in debt securities are available for issuance .
In secondary trading , investment - grade corporate bonds ended <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/8</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/4</ENAMEX> higher .
Municipals
Actively traded municipal bonds ended <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/4</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</ENAMEX> point higher in brisk trading , despite a flood of new supply .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.20 %</ENAMEX> issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</ENAMEX> finished <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/4</ENAMEX> point stronger at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 1/2</ENAMEX> bid , to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.32 %</ENAMEX> .
Traders said municipals were underpinned by influences including the climb in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> issue prices .
Also , municipal bonds lured buying because the stock market remains wobbly , traders contended .
Mainly , though , it was a favorable outlook for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's new supply that propped up municipals , some traders said .
Among the new issues was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 230 million</ENAMEX> of general obligation bonds .
The bonds were won by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Goldman , Sachs -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> group with a true interest cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.17 %</ENAMEX> .
They were priced to yield from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.00 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.20 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2009</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> deal had an unsold balance of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 84.3 million</ENAMEX> in late trading , the underwriter said .
Mortgage - , Asset - Backed Securities
Mortgage securities gained <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/32</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/32</ENAMEX> point after a hectic session , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Government National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> securities as the standout issue .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> issue rose amid talk of large purchases of the securities by institutional investors .
The derivative markets remained active as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> new issue was priced and talk circulated about more offerings in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ENAMEX> issued a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</ENAMEX> real estate mortgage investment conduit backed by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 1/2 %</ENAMEX> securities .
In the asset - backed market , a big offering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford Motor Credit Corp .</ENAMEX> auto - loan securities was increased in size after strong institutional demand .
The deal by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> unit , priced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> , was increased to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.05 billion</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.58 billion</ENAMEX> .
Among major pass - through issues , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> securities for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> delivery ended at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 15/32</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5/32</ENAMEX> , after touching an early high of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 27/32</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> securities were at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94 5/32</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/32</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 1/2 %</ENAMEX> securities at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 15/32</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4/32</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> securities at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 11/32</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/32</ENAMEX> .

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> issue was yielding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.34 %</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">12 - year</ENAMEX> average life assumption , as the spread above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> note held at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.46</ENAMEX> percentage points .
Foreign Bonds
The Eurodollar bond market sprang to life late in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> trading session after the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled .
Eurodollar bonds are often issued by foreign corporations , but interest and principal are paid in dollars .
The bonds ended <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1/2</ENAMEX> point higher <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
Prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> government bonds also rose as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> stocks declined .
