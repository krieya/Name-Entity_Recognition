A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> cancer patient has become something of a celebrity .
After doctors told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu Yo Ching</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> that he had <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</ENAMEX> to live , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu</ENAMEX> began writing a diary on the internet .
Now , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five months later</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu</ENAMEX> has survived to see his cyber diary published as a book .
As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dunkin Humet</ENAMEX> reports , some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> readers are grateful for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu</ENAMEX> 's writings but other find them offensive .
In the private ward of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu Mu Yeng</ENAMEX> is a perfect host , offering her visitors tea and chatting calmly .
In the next room her husband <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu Yo Ching</ENAMEX> lies sleeping in the final stages of cancer , exhausted both by the battle with the disease and by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> of painful writing which have brought him both fame and criticism .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu Mu Yeng</ENAMEX> says he originally began his controversial diary as a purely personal concern .
Before he put it on the internet he started writing at home for our daughter .
As his illness developed he realized that in the future our daughter might lack the guidance of a father .
So I encouraged him to write something to leave for her .
But as he wrote the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">37 - year - old</ENAMEX> former literature student , melon salesman , advertising executive and real estate manager decided he had feelings he wished to share with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> society at large .
He sought out a local web site , which agreed to publish sections of his writings on the internet .
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Diary of Death</ENAMEX> , as it became known , affected many with its outspoken views , particularly Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu</ENAMEX> 's reflections on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">6 years</ENAMEX> as a cancer sufferer in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
From the moment you pick up a lab report stating that the doctor has diagnosed cancerous cells , life starts to get tough .
If you 're an official your career will stop dead .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Personnel Department</ENAMEX> will start looking for your successor and people will start positioning themselves to replace you .
If you 're a businessperson your credit will suddenly be devalued .
Even husbands or wives will start making calculations about the future .
And if <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> people 's attitude to cancer is a tragedy , writes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu Yo Ching</ENAMEX> , the treatment of cancer patients in the medical system is like a black farce , high in cost but often ineffective .
He compares the country 's overcrowded cancer wards to a conveyor belt where the surgeons are skilled because they have so much practice that bribes are often necessary to get quick treatment .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu Yo Ching 's</ENAMEX> criticisms and his decision earlier this year to stop taking medication and stay out of hospital for as long as possible have provoked widespread debate .
His wife <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu Mu Yeng</ENAMEX> sighs as she describes the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</ENAMEX> e-mail messages in their in - box .
Many have been supportive and admiring but by no means all .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inzer</ENAMEX> , an editor with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> based web - site many people feel that it 's not appropriate for a dying man to go so public with his views on his illness .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> people 's idea we have a tradition like we do n't talk to anybody about family things , especially some kind of unfortunate thing .
For lots of old people it 's very shocking .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu Yo Ching</ENAMEX> has freely admitted that he 'd be pleased if the book version of his diary earns some money to support his wife and daughter , yet his real interest is to provoke debate on life and how to live it .
Life when you 're sick tastes bitter , but it can also be fun if you 're lucky enough to master secrets on how to turn the bitter into fun .
Avoid all household chores .
This is the common objective of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Women 's Liberation Movement</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Men 's Epiphany Movement</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
Always think about spending money but never think about earning it .
Never get into a quarrel with your family where you feel like you are the police and they are the common people .
Enjoy a fresh fruit in all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> seasons and fresh flowers everywhere .
You do n't need to dress too properly .
Attractiveness lies in being a mess .
Never worry whether the battery will run out on your mobile phone .
And people will remember you if you do good things by chance .
Despite all the criticism and the media spotlight <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu Yo Ching 's</ENAMEX> wife <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu Mu Yeng</ENAMEX> says she believes that his decision to write the diary was a good thing .
Lots of people think that my husband 's actions could have a lot of negative consequences , but I say , ' Long live understanding . '
At least it has made people think about life , and that was my husband 's highest aim .

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dunkin Hewerd</ENAMEX> reported that story from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> .
