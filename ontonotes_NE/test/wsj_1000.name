<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kemper Financial Services Inc.</ENAMEX> , charging that program trading is ruining the stock market , cut off <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> big Wall Street firms from doing any of its stock - trading business .
The move is the biggest salvo yet in the renewed outcry against program trading , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kemper</ENAMEX> putting its money -- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">the millions of dollars</ENAMEX> in commissions it generates <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</ENAMEX> -- where its mouth is .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kemper Corp.</ENAMEX> unit and other critics complain that program trading causes wild swings in stock prices , such as on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> and on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 13</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">16</ENAMEX> , and has increased chances for market crashes .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past nine months</ENAMEX> , several firms , including discount broker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Charles Schwab -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sears , Roebuck -AMP- Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ENAMEX> unit , have attacked program trading as a major market evil .
Several big securities firms backed off from program trading <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash .
But most of them , led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Morgan Stanley -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , moved back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> .
The most volatile form of program trading is index arbitrage -- the rapid - fire , computer - guided buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in stock - index futures and options .
The object is to capture profits from fleeting price discrepancies between the futures and options and the stocks themselves .
Index arbitrage recently has accounted for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</ENAMEX> of all program trading on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</ENAMEX> , program trading accounted for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.9 million</ENAMEX> shares a day , or a record <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.8 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board 's</ENAMEX> average <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> volume .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kemper</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bear , Stearns -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Electric Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder , Peabody -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> unit , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Oppenheimer -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> that it will no longer do business with them because of their commitment to index arbitrage , officials inside and outside these firms confirmed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kemper</ENAMEX> officials declined to identify the firms but acknowledged a long - simmering dispute with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> securities firms and said the list of brokers it wo n't do business with may be lengthened in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the months ahead</ENAMEX> .
`` We 've been opposed to '' index arbitrage `` for a long time , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen B. Timbers</ENAMEX> , chief investment officer at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kemper</ENAMEX> , which manages <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 56 billion</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 billion</ENAMEX> of stocks .
`` Index arbitrage does n't work , and it scares natural buyers '' of stock .
While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timbers</ENAMEX> explained he 's `` not totally convinced index arbitrage changes the overall level of the stock market , '' he said that `` on an intraday basis , it has major effects .
We 've talked to proponents of index arbitrage and told them to cool it because they 're ruining the market .
They said , ` Too bad , ' so we finally said we 're not going to do business with them . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kemper</ENAMEX> also blasted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> for ignoring the interests of individual and institutional holders .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> has vested interests '' in its big member securities firms `` that cloud its objectivity , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timbers</ENAMEX> said .
`` It has never been interested in what we think .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Big Board</ENAMEX> also has a terrible communication problem with individual investors , '' he added .
Small investors perceive that `` big operators '' dominate the market , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas O'Hara</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Association of Investors</ENAMEX> and head of the exchange 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Individual Investors Advisory Committee</ENAMEX> set up after the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash .
`` The impression I 've got is they 'd love to do away with it -LCB- program trading -RCB- , but they -LCB- the exchange -RCB- ca n't do it , '' he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Phelan</ENAMEX> said in a recent interview that he has no inclination to eliminate program trading .
He said the market 's volatility disturbs him , but that all the exchange can do is `` slow down the process '' by using its circuit breakers and shock absorbers .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timbers</ENAMEX> countered that `` the mere fact they put in circuit breakers is an admission of their problems . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> biggest program trading firms , staunchly defend their strategies .
`` We continue to believe the position we 've taken is reasonable , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> official said .
`` We would stop index arbitrage when the market is under stress , and we have recently , '' he said , citing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 13</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this week</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Carpenter</ENAMEX> , president and chief executive officer at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> , said in a recent interview , `` We do n't think that index arbitrage has a negative impact on the market as a whole . ''
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Eckenfelder</ENAMEX> , a securities industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential - Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kemper</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> firm to make a major statement with program trading . ''
He added that `` having <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</ENAMEX> firm do this is n't going to mean a hill of beans .
But if this prompts others to consider the same thing , then it may become much more important .
