Federal drug regulators , concerned over <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> reports that diabetics have died after shifting from animal to human - based insulin , say they are considering a study to see if similar deaths have occurred here .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> reports came from Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Toseland</ENAMEX> , head of clinical chemistry at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Guy 's Hospital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> .
In a telephone interview <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toseland</ENAMEX> said the number of sudden , unexplained deaths of diabetics he had seen <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> compared with just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least six</ENAMEX> of the deaths occurred among relatively young diabetics who had switched from animal to human insulin within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</ENAMEX> , he said .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomon Sobel</ENAMEX> , director of metabolism and endrocrine drug products for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FDA</ENAMEX> officials have discussed Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toseland</ENAMEX> 's findings `` fairly intensively . ''
While there have been no reports of similar sudden unexplained deaths among diabetics in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sobel</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FDA</ENAMEX> plans to examine Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toseland</ENAMEX> 's evidence and is considering its own study here .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toseland</ENAMEX> , a toxicologist , said he was preparing an article for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> forensic medical journal raising the possibility that the deaths may have occurred after human insulin blunted critical warning signs indicating hypoglycemia , or low blood sugar , which can kill diabetics .
The usual warning signs of hypoglycemia include sweating , anxiety and cramps .
With proper warning , diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by eating sugar or sugary food .
`` The anecdotal data certainly shows that some of the people were not aware of the rapid onset of hypoglycemia , '' Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toseland</ENAMEX> said .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> , Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert E. Silverman</ENAMEX> , chief of the diabetes program branch , said no evidence of unexpected deaths from hypoglycemia had shown up in a study of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</ENAMEX> diabetics that has been under way at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NIH</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> .
However , he said officials conducting the study had n't been looking for signs of problems related to hypoglycemia unawareness .
`` We are now monitoring for it much more closely , '' he said .
`` We do know there are slight differences in the way human and animal insulins drive down blood sugar , '' Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sobel</ENAMEX> said .
The human - based drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner and drives it down faster , he said .
`` But we do n't believe there is enough of a difference to be clinically significant , '' Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sobel</ENAMEX> said .
Reports of Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toseland</ENAMEX> 's findings in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> press have triggered widespread concern among diabetics there .
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the British Diabetic Association</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Committee on Safety in Medicines</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's equivalent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. FDA</ENAMEX> -- recently issued statements noting the lack of hard scientific evidence to support Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toseland</ENAMEX> 's findings .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the American Diabetes Association</ENAMEX> issued a similar statement urging the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> diabetics not to overreact to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> report .
`` A loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia is a complex problem that is very unlikely to be due simply to the type of insulin used , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> association said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FDA</ENAMEX> already requires drug manufacturers to include warnings with insulin products that symptoms of hypoglycemia are less pronounced with human insulin than with animal - based products .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eli Lilly -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> - based drug manufacturer , dominates the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> human insulin market with its product known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Humulin</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lilly</ENAMEX> is building plants to make the insulin in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fagershein</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> .
In its latest annual report , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lilly</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Humulin</ENAMEX> sales have shown `` excellent growth . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lilly</ENAMEX> officials said they had seen reports of hypoglycemic unawareness among some patients making the shift from animal to human insulin , but did n't know if the problem had caused any deaths .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh Thompson</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lilly</ENAMEX> group vice president , said the company 's clinical trials of both its animal and human - based insulins indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toseland</ENAMEX> said most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> diabetics who died had been taking a human - based insulin made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Novo / Nordisk</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Danish</ENAMEX> manufacturer .
None of the diabetics were using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lilly</ENAMEX> 's insulin .
