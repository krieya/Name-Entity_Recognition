An international team is developing a vaccine against Alzheimer 's Disease and they are trying it out on a new and improved mouse model of the onus .
Correspondent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Berman</ENAMEX> explains .
Scientists working on a vaccine against Alzheimer 's give a progress report <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> in the journal <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nature</ENAMEX> .
The vaccine has only been tested in mice that have been bred to have a form of Alzheimer 's Disease very similar to that of humans .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">University of Toronto</ENAMEX> researcher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Westaway</ENAMEX> , another team of scientists <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> took the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> step toward an Alzheimer 's vaccine .
That team injected a small amount of amyloid protein , which accumulates in brains of Alzheimer 's patients and injected it in the mice 's abdomens .
The injection prompted the animals ' immune systems to kick in and clean up the amyloid deposits in the rodents ' brains .
But those mice never had any difficulties with learning and memory .
In Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Westaway</ENAMEX> 's view , this made the vaccine sort of pointless , since learning and memory problems are a hallmark of Alzheimer 's Disease .
So his research team decided to test a vaccine in mice with Alzheimer 's more like that seen in many humans .
Now normally Alzheimer 's Disease might have this strong deficit in learning and memory , actually in our experiments the ability to navigate around a small tank of water using cues pinned up on the wall of the testing room , and once we started immunizing the mice against the Alzheimer Disease peptides then the performance showed a dramatic improvement such as they came very close to the performance of regular mice that have not been genetically engineered to resemble Alzheimer 's Disease .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> Alzheimer 's vaccine experiment was also reported in the journal <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nature</ENAMEX> by a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">University of South Florida</ENAMEX> scientists in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tampa</ENAMEX> .
In a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> published paper researchers formally described how they genetically engineered a mouse model of Alzheimer 's similar to the human disease , complete with memory and learning impairment .
Neuroscientist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Chapman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Cardiff School of Bio-Sciences</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wales</ENAMEX> , wrote an article in the magazine commenting on the developments .
We all know we 've got a long way to go before we have a cure for Alzheimer 's Disease , but in order to get there we need to have confidence that we understand the disease and that we have what we call a model system for predicting whether these treatments will work .
And the fact that these papers are now showing us that behaviorally these models do what humans do , that is they behave more poorly as they age if they have Alzheimer 's genes , and that these treatments can reverse that , it just means we have that much more confidence these treatments will work in humans .
In a related development an international team of researchers reports in the latest issue of the journal <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Science</ENAMEX> , that a genetic mutation in an area of chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</ENAMEX> may put some people at increased risk of late onset Alzheimer 's Disease , the most common form of dementia in the elderly .
