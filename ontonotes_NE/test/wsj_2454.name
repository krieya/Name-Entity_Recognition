<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Sisulu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the African National Congress</ENAMEX> came home <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">26 years</ENAMEX> in prison , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisulu</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">77 - year - old</ENAMEX> former secretary - general of the liberation movement , was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming up .
At the same time , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> colleagues , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> of whom were arrested with him in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</ENAMEX> and sentenced to life imprisonment , were reunited with their families at various places around the country .
And as the graying men returned to their homes , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> , outlawed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</ENAMEX> and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government , defiantly returned to the streets of the country 's black townships .
A huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> flag , with black , green and gold stripes , was hoisted over the rickety gate at Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisulu</ENAMEX> 's modest house , while on the street out front , boys displayed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> colors on their shirts , caps and scarves .
At the small <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - room home of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elias Motsoaledi</ENAMEX> , a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> unionist and a former commander in the group 's armed wing , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Umkhonto we Sizwe</ENAMEX> , well - wishers stuck little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> ribbons .
`` I am happy to see the spirit of the people , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisulu</ENAMEX> , looking dapper in a new gray suit .
As the crowd outside his home shouted `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> , '' the old man shot his fists into the air .
`` I 'm inspired by the mood of the people . ''
Under the laws of the land , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> remains an illegal organization , and its headquarters are still in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lusaka</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zambia</ENAMEX> .
But the unconditional release of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> leaders , who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> , is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing .
`` The government can never put the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> back into the bottle again , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cassim Saloojee</ENAMEX> , a veteran anti-apartheid activist on hand to welcome Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisulu</ENAMEX> .
`` Things have gone too far for the government to stop them now .
There 's no turning back . ''
There was certainly no stopping the tide of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> emotion <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of people jammed into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Holy Cross Anglican Church</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soweto</ENAMEX> for what became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> rally in the country in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</ENAMEX> .
Deafening chants of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Umkhonto we Sizwe</ENAMEX> '' shook the church as the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> aging men vowed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts , including the armed struggle .
And they called on the government to release <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Mandela</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> 's leading figure , who was jailed with them and remains in prison .
Without him , said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisulu</ENAMEX> , the freeing of the others `` is only a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> - measure . ''
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F.W. de Klerk</ENAMEX> released the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> men -- along with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the founding members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Pan Africanist Congress</ENAMEX> , a rival liberation group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pretoria</ENAMEX> may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country .
As other repressive governments , particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</ENAMEX> go by , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South African</ENAMEX> government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandela</ENAMEX> as well as the continued banning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> and enforcement of the state of emergency .
If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> , the expectations and promise raised by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest .
If it does , the large number of right - wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands .
The newly released <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> leaders also will be under enormous pressure .
The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti-government protests and violence ; if it does , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pretoria</ENAMEX> will use this as a reason to keep Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandela</ENAMEX> behind bars .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pretoria</ENAMEX> has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> place : for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government .
In addition , the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment .
In order to head off any divisions , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandela</ENAMEX> , in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released , instructed them to report to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lusaka</ENAMEX> as soon as possible .
The men also will be faced with bridging the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many militant black youths , the so - called young lions who are anxious to see the old lions in action .
Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Mokaba</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the South African Youth Congress</ENAMEX> : `` We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ANC</ENAMEX> . ''
They never considered themselves to be anything else .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night 's</ENAMEX> rally , they called on their followers to be firm , yet disciplined , in their opposition to apartheid .
`` We emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very , very sensitive , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Mlangeni</ENAMEX> , another early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Umkhonto</ENAMEX> leader who is now <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">63</ENAMEX> .
`` We want to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Mandela</ENAMEX> and all our comrades out of prison , and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us .
