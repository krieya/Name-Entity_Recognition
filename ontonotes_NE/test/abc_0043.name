Israeli Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> says he will resign <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> .
Sometimes things are not as they seem .
This is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of them .
This is a political chess move .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillian Findlay</ENAMEX> is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> .
It was an emotional speech and one that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> had not expected .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Tomorrow morning</ENAMEX> I will inform the President of my decision to resign , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> .
`` I will ask again for the trust of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> people . ''
That trust has plummeted in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year and a half</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> came to power .
Failed peace talks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> and the violence that has followed weakened him , strengthened the speculation that former Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> might return to politics and try to unseat him .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> would win easily according to polls .
That may be why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> has chosen to resign now .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> was headed towards an early general election .
By announcing his resignation , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> has ensured it will be a different election , a special election for Prime Minister only .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> will not be eligible .
That 's because under <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's election rules , only a sitting member of parliament can run in a special election .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> gave up his seat when he lost the last election .
Thanks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillian Findlay</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> .
