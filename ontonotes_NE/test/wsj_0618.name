The head of the nation 's largest car - dealers group is telling dealers to `` just say no '' when auto makers pressure them to stockpile cars on their lots .
In an open letter that will run <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> in the trade journal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Automotive News</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Tonkin</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Car Dealers Association</ENAMEX> , says dealers should cut their inventories to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than half</ENAMEX> the level traditionally considered desirable .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tonkin</ENAMEX> , who has been feuding with the Big Three since he took office <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> , said that with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> of the nation 's dealers losing money or breaking even , it was time for `` emergency action . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> car dealers had an average of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">59 days '</ENAMEX> supply of cars in their lots at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of September</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ward</ENAMEX> 's Automotive Reports .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tonkin</ENAMEX> said dealers should slash stocks to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">between 15 and 30 days</ENAMEX> to reduce the costs of financing inventory .
His message is getting a chilly reception in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> , where the Big Three auto makers are already being forced to close plants because of soft sales and reduced dealer orders .
Even before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tonkin</ENAMEX> 's broadside , some large dealers said they were cutting inventories .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> representatives criticized Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tonkin</ENAMEX> 's plan as unworkable .
It `` is going to sound neat to the dealer except when his <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">15 - day</ENAMEX> car supply does n't include the bright red one that the lady wants to buy and she goes up the street to buy one , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler</ENAMEX> spokesman said .
