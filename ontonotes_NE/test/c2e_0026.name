<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">" 8 / 15 "</ENAMEX> - our victory day .
（一）
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> people , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> is a special day .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This day</ENAMEX> came with great difficulty for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
Before the war , the gap between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> was far greater than mere numbers .
Before the war , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's steel production was less than <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200,000 tons</ENAMEX> -LRB- steel production in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> was centered mainly in the northeast , and it was controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's was about <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 million tons</ENAMEX> .
The important thing is that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> had a complete industrial system and was able to independently produce all its weapons , from handguns to aircraft carriers , and it had a formidable research production capacity .
At that time , every year they were able to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,580</ENAMEX> airplanes , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">744</ENAMEX> large - bore cannon , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">330</ENAMEX> tanks , , more than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,500</ENAMEX> vehicles , with a shipbuilding capacity of more than <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">400,000 tons</ENAMEX> and a naval construction capacity of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50,000 tons</ENAMEX> .
Compared to this , at the time <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> could only produce rifles and small cannon ; its capacity to produce heavy weapons was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</ENAMEX> .
The only munitions plant capable of producing heavy weapons in the northeast was taken over by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> .
This means that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's consumption could not be met .
Before the war , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's air force had some <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</ENAMEX> airplanes ; that may seem like quite a few , but they were all used up in just <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</ENAMEX> , and afterward we could only watch as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> aircrafts ruled the skies over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
On the surface , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is a large country , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> was the little guy taking on the giant .
The most obvious part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's being a big country was its population advantage .
In fact <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's total population after it had taken over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , the Northeast , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> was not so very much smaller than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's , with about <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200 million</ENAMEX> people , at best a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL" E_OFF="2">2:1</ENAMEX> ratio .
The important thing is that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> had a complete reserve system , with more than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four million</ENAMEX> reserves who had received basic military training .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> had basically no reserve military personnel , and the " national army " relied primarily on seizing able - bodied men to fill its ranks .
These so - called able - bodied men were sorely lacking in training ; all they could do was learn to fight in battle .
Therefore , in the field , it often happened that a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> battalion -LRB- battalion system -RRB- was able to defeat a whole division of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> army ; it was not just the difference in equipment : even more important were the differences in logistical supplies and training .
-RAB- The training gap in particular can be said to have been the difference between earth and sky .
In terms of the standards of Western armies , except for a few divisions , at the time for most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> military units of every description it would be more appropriate to speak of militia , or mobs of bandits .
What was even more disheartening was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's disintegration :
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</ENAMEX> of bloody battles between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nationalists</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communists</ENAMEX> , and among the warlords like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feng</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gui</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's vital organs were diseased , and it was like adding frost on top of snow .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's plans to " conquer <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> attack " and to " take <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three to six months</ENAMEX> " were not mere fantasy .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's low - key <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War of Resistance</ENAMEX> also had a basis in reality : it seemed that without a miracle , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> would be doomed .
-LRB <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> -RRB-
But the miracle happened , and what is more , this miracle was created by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> people !
In the face of an unprecedented national enemy , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> race demonstrated rare courage and fortitude .
In terms of their military strength , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's army taking on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> army was like an egg attacking a rock .
But the eggs advanced again and again , and the wounds on the rock added up !
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taierzhuang</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wanjialing</ENAMEX> , the prestige of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the " Great Japanese Imperial Army "</ENAMEX> came tumbling down again and again .
In his memoirs , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Zongren</ENAMEX> took great delight in talking about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taierzhuang</ENAMEX> , where he used cast - off troops , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sichuan</ENAMEX> troops and Northeastern troops to inflict heavy losses on the supremely arrogant " <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Great Japanese Imperial Army</ENAMEX> " ; in his own view , it was all rather inconceivable .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1937 to 1941</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> fought against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> on its own , and it even counterattacked .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> organized a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</ENAMEX> offensive on the front in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</ENAMEX> there were a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</ENAMEX> battles in the enemy 's rear area , which let the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> army know that their enemy was still alive and kicking .
In order to resolve the " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> incident , " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> sent in even young boys to fight ; at the height of it , there was only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> division left in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
Of course if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> had fully mobilized , it could have called up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several million</ENAMEX> more troops , as in the later time when they knew they were about to be annihilated .
But mobilizing troops at home and sending them off to another country are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> different things ; it was just that their logistics could n't support it .
Troops leaving the country to fight need to be lean and vigorous .
It was n't that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> did n't want to settle the " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> incident , " it was that they could n't .
What created this miracle in reality was the awakening of the sense of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> nationhood .
In historical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , you were loyal to the emperor , not to the country .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yue Fei</ENAMEX> directly smashed the home of the enemy in order to wash away the " shame of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Jingkang</ENAMEX> and the officials ' regret . "
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shi Kefa</ENAMEX> wept blood , it was for the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">the Chongzhen Emperor</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the War of Anti-Japanese Resistance</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> people burned with an enormous patriotic fervor , and they demonstrated a fierce determination to resist .
In their memoirs , generals of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nationalist</ENAMEX> army mention that when they were wounded in the civil war no one paid any attention , and they themselves all felt like thieves .
But generals wounded fighting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> received endless fresh flowers in condolence , making them feel like the center of attention .
This was such an enormous contrast that it was a great stimulus for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nationalist</ENAMEX> army generals .
With the fatherland in jeopardy , even overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> demonstrated unprecedented patriotic fervor , vigorously supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War of Resistance</ENAMEX> , providing both manpower and financial aid .
Large numbers of overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> returned to fight ; in some years the aid donated by overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> amounted to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one - half</ENAMEX> of the government 's expenditures , creating a fresh contrast to the historically poor image of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> as lacking civic pride and being politically indifferent .
During <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the War of Resistance</ENAMEX> , overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> donated <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of times more money than did overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Central Army</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Jin Army</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Sichuan Army</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Northwest Army</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Gui Army</ENAMEX> , etc. , and of course <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Eighth Route Army</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New Fourth Army</ENAMEX> , which until then had been implacable enemies , came together to rescue the imperiled nation , and that was not an easy matter .
At the time , the officers and men of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Red Army</ENAMEX> almost all had an account of blood and tears .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Nationalist Army 's</ENAMEX> purging of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Red Army</ENAMEX> base areas was no less fierce than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> policy of killing , burning and looting .
If we think of the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX> , when the state was about to fall , the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ming</ENAMEX> continued its bickering , with endless internal disputes among the various princes who all seemed to be enjoying it .
-LRB- In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jin Yong 's</ENAMEX> masterpiece , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Luding Annals</ENAMEX> , just for the sake of selecting an heir between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhu Three</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhu Five</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> royal families started fighting and got <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the key persons killed , which stirred up a great storm . -RRB-
The state of disunity repeatedly lamented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yatsen</ENAMEX> had quite unexpectedly turned to unity , and at least in the early phases of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the War of Resistance</ENAMEX> all sides basically cooperated in good faith and all made an effort ; it ca n't be said that this is not a miracle of history .
For example , Brothers Magic Sky -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Qingpin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Zhonghou</ENAMEX> -RRB- previously read a book ; the author signed his name as " Shaohua , Youhu . "
The book was entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">" Lin Biao : His Life "</ENAMEX>
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</ENAMEX> chapter , " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">First Medal in the War against Japan</ENAMEX> , " it mentions that after the great victory at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pingxingguan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin Biao</ENAMEX> was accidentally wounded .
At the time , the chief of staff and front - line commander of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kuomintang</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> theater of operations , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wei Lihuang</ENAMEX> , got the news and made a special trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ershilibao</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yan'an</ENAMEX> to extend his condolences .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">The next day</ENAMEX> , he was unexpectedly detained as he returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xi'an</ENAMEX> , and he personally ordered that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Eighth Route Army</ENAMEX> be given a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</ENAMEX> rounds of ammunition , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</ENAMEX> hand grenades , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</ENAMEX> boxes of cartons of beef .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thirty days later</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than ten</ENAMEX> military trucks brought the ammunition and canned beef to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ershilibao</ENAMEX> , a flush of red appeared on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin Biao 's</ENAMEX> pallid face , and he said repeatedly , " It 's a huge gift , it 's a huge gift ! "
This shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the War of Resistance</ENAMEX> was the cradle for the rebirth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> people .
During the war , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> left no stone unturned in threatening to bribe <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> into collaborating .
But of the many powerful local warlords , not <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> went over to the other side .
Even outmoded warlords like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yan Xishan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanxi</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Long Yun</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yunnan</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Peifu</ENAMEX> could not be won over .
Compared to the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX> , it can not be said that this too is not a miracle .
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</ENAMEX> -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Around Sept. 18 , 1931</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , despite entreaties at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the League of Nations</ENAMEX> , never got any sympathy or support , but after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July 7 , 1937</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> relied on its own resistance to win international respect and assistance ; Heaven helps those who help themselves .
A strong sense of nationhood supported the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> people through repeated losses and battles , and helped it get through those dark days .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's perseverance was just the right thing to strike at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's weak spot ; countries like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> have trouble sustaining a high - intensity war .
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">The First Sino - Japanese War</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Russo - Japanese War</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">9/18</ENAMEX> all ended in a short time , and there were no destructive effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's economic structure .
On the other hand , each time they fought , they acquired a large amount of booty , which greatly increased <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's strength .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the War of Resistance</ENAMEX> was not like that ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> were unable to support the war through fighting .
Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's strength and wealth , it was even unable to bear the cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Vietnam War</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Four years</ENAMEX> of fierce fighting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> had in fact left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> exhausted ; military spending was exploding , inflation at home was soaring , supplies were stretched thin , gold and foreign currency reserves were depleted , and the domestic economy was on the verge of collapse , and this enabled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> to throttle the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japanese</ENAMEX> by the neck , meaning that they forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> to take a highly risky military gamble .
The outbreak of the war in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Pacific</ENAMEX> was a turning point .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> is an island , sea transport is its lifeline , so the decisive field of battle was the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Pacific</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> field of battle had already fulfilled its mission .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> did not have the strength to chase out the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> army .
And the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> did not have the capability to wipe out the " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chongqing</ENAMEX> army " and the " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yan'an</ENAMEX> army . "
Both sides could only stay put and wait .
" If allied forces win , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> can not lose ;
If the allied forces lose , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> can not win . "
Although it upset the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kuomintang</ENAMEX> blamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Communist Party</ENAMEX> for not attacking ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Communist Party</ENAMEX> accused the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kuomintang</ENAMEX> of remaining passive , but that was necessary at the time .
Although we were unable to drive the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> out , because this exceeded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's industrial capacity and technical and economic levels at the time , " <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">8/15</ENAMEX> " is still our Victory Day .
Our sacrifice well deserves this victory , because we made every effort .
Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> victorious nations of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is more qualified than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> to bask in the glory of victory .
Before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">WWII</ENAMEX> , in the area of world industry and modern military affairs , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> was really unworthy of mention , not even on a par with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> or any other mid-level <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> country .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's contribution to the war against Fascism in fact far surpassed its own abilities .
And this contribution was made using " blood and flesh to build our new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> . "
For this day , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> soldiers stained the battlefield with their blood , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of millions</ENAMEX> of ordinary people died , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of yuan</ENAMEX> in assets were lost : it was a huge price to pay .
We can not forget our glory , nor can we forget the price we paid .
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</ENAMEX> -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Several years back</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou Zuoren</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Ailing</ENAMEX> 's works thrilled a generation .
But some people complained that they have been treated unfairly .
Their works certainly appeal to the emotions and tastes of people nowadays who have gotten rich by various means , and literarily speaking they could sometimes be original .
But literature is a moral force , and the integrity of these easy - living social paragons is even lower than that of thieves ; they certainly have no sense of duty to their country , and it can even be said that they have no shame .
How can they expect to be respected by society as a whole ?
What kind of soul do their works have ?
If we can forgive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou Zuoren</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Ailing</ENAMEX> , then how , at the very worst , can we face <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao Yiman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Jingyu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chao Shangzhi</ENAMEX> , who at the same historical period crawled over ice and slept in snow , willing to die rather than yield ?
Our world is still not peaceful ; our enemies are still eyeing us covetously .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Jingwei</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou Zuoren</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Ailing</ENAMEX> and their ilk should be relegated to history 's wall of shame forever .
