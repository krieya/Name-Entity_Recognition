In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> divers cut through the deck of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the `` USS Cole ''</ENAMEX> to remove the last <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> sailors who died in the attack .
Their bodies will head home <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , senators were asking the general who sent <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the `` USS Cole ''</ENAMEX> into the port of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> , why he made that decision .
Here 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John M Wethy</ENAMEX> .
The man who opened the door for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> warships to use the port of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> made no apologies <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
The refueling of that ship in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> was my decision .
I want to be clear .
I pass that buck on to nobody .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> question all of us keep hearing , Why <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> ?
The threat conditions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> the specific threat conditions , were actually better than we had elsewhere .
General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zinni</ENAMEX> said all her ports , from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Suez Canal</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> , had their own problems , either credible terrorists threats , unstable governments , or harbors jammed with small boats , plus , the government of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> wanted better relations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and had begun taking steps to control local terrorist activity , but improved relations , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zinni</ENAMEX> said , did not blind the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> to the risks .
I do n't want anyone to think we ever in any instance , anywhere , ever took a risk for the purpose of a better relationship with a country and put a soldier , sailor , airman or marine at risk for that reason .
Absolutely not .
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> senators wondered why the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> '' and other ships were not routinely taking the far safer approach of refueling at sea ?
I think I 'm hearing you say , `` we do n't have enough tankers to be sure that we could do that . ''
That 's my sense , Senator .
The general had <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> more troubling message .
Terrorists are getting smarter , using nastier weapons , and as long as they are willing to die in their attacks , it will be virtually impossible to stop them all .
