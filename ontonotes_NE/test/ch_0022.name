%hm
Never seen so many dots .
Well , I see
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">University of Michigan</ENAMEX> education , I mean
Well I guess if
yeah ,
I guess all all pretty much like universities would have E D U at the end .
yeah ?
I think .
Mom does n't have one does she ?
No , I do n't think so .
mhm .
%um , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lori</ENAMEX> , I 'm trying to figure out my plans .
I still have no idea what I 'm doing when I get to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>
and nothing has worked out
but I 'm still coming .
You 're kidding .
No , I 'm serious .
But I 'm still coming .
did you ever %um get in touch with %uh
I had given you the the other the fax of the number of the girl in %uh
You mean the
y- %um yeah
well I I I did fax them a letter .
It was little bit after that date like maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week later</ENAMEX> .
yeah ?
I faxed them a letter
and I never heard from them .
And I had and I ha-
I ba- basically
what she kind of said is you know come and we 'll talk sort of thing .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
so basically the one
okay
the well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Interns For Peace</ENAMEX> retracted their offer because they decided I was n't enthusiastic enough .
Who 's this ?
%um <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Interns For Peace</ENAMEX> ?
mhm .
Like they had offered me a place
and then they took it back .
But did n't you also say you you were still were n't that keen on them ?
Right ,
I was n't
but I still would have rather rejected them than have them reject me .
yeah .
yeah
And then %um and then the next place which I was so hopeful about was was %um <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moden Nisan</ENAMEX>
yeah
yeah
That thing at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haifa</ENAMEX> with %eh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Young Women 's Leadership Program</ENAMEX> .
yeah ?
And the woman made it sound so promising
and I waited <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</ENAMEX> to hear back
mhm .
And then I had n't heard from her
and it was after the date
so I called
mhm .
And she said oh I was going to fax you this evening
%um you know we 're not really sure what 's happening .
The position may be being redefined
%eh .
And then <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week later</ENAMEX> , she called me and left a message saying oh you know they had all these things on the burner
and r- I should really look someplace else because they do n't know what 's going on
and
%hm .
And so th- I had really stopped looking for things because he made it sound so promising and like it was going to be almost fulltime .
%hm .
And then That 's a shame . And then it you know so instead it and now it 's like you know maybe a ten hour a week position
and it requires fluent <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>
and it 's just totally different than what we had talked about .
That 's a shame
And so then , meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Giva - Haviva</ENAMEX> had offered me a a very short term parttime internship
yeah ,
you mentioned
by writing up something to
yeah
like helping with grant writing and miscellaneous things and living on a nearby kibbutz maybe is it <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Ma'anit</ENAMEX> ?
%hm .
You could be even living at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> 's and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savia</ENAMEX> 's and get to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Giva - Haviva</ENAMEX> .
yeah ,
but it might be nice to be on the kibbutz because then I would get to know some people .
yeah .
yeah
But anyway ,
so then %ah
but that was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three months ago</ENAMEX> that they offered me that
and you know who knows if they found someone
so I faxed them about <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week and a half ago</ENAMEX> .
yeah .
mhm .
And I had n't heard back from them
and so I I called the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> office
and she said she 'd get back to me probably you know <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , as soon as she could talk with them .
%hm .
mhm .
Because maybe they found someone ,
I do n't know .
yeah .
So that 's
I 'm I 'm really hoping that that would work out you know ,
it 's just something
yeah .
But if not I mean I 'm just coming anyway
but I have no idea like where I 'll go
When are you planning on coming ?
And
Sometime either like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid to late September</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early October</ENAMEX> .
mhm . mhm .
%um
Because I 'm thinking that I 'd like to stop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Europe</ENAMEX> on the way and visit some friends .
I have a friend in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and a friend in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and a and a friend in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>
