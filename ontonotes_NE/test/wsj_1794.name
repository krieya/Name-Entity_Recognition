<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renault</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DAF Trucks NV</ENAMEX> announced a preliminary agreement to jointly manufacture a line of trucks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe Gras</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renault</ENAMEX> managing director , said the new line will cover trucks of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between 2.5 tons and 4.2 tons</ENAMEX> and will be built at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renault</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bapilly</ENAMEX> plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DAF</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> plant .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> state - controlled auto group and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Dutch</ENAMEX> truck maker plan to incorporate the new trucks into their product lines when they begin production toward <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the 1990s</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gras</ENAMEX> said he expects a definitive agreement between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> companies to be completed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few months</ENAMEX> .
The venture is the latest example of the trend toward cooperative projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> ahead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> deadline for eliminating trade barriers within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Community</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renault</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DAF</ENAMEX> are expected to invest a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about three billion French francs</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 157.8 million</ENAMEX> -RRB- in the venture , including <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">FFr 1 billion</ENAMEX> for design and development costs .
In addition , the companies will each spend <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about FFr 1 billion</ENAMEX> on tooling up their plants .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gras</ENAMEX> said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renault</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DAF</ENAMEX> , since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles .
By pooling their resources , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> groups have effectively halved the design and development costs that would otherwise have been entailed , he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renault</ENAMEX> officials said the potential <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> market for light trucks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 - ton</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.2 - ton</ENAMEX> range is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 700,000 and 800,000</ENAMEX> vehicles <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renault</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DAF</ENAMEX> are aiming for a combined market share of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 11 %</ENAMEX> .
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renault</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DAF</ENAMEX> will have world - wide marketing rights for the new range of vans and light trucks .
Under a separate arrangement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">British Aerospace PLC 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rover Group PLC</ENAMEX> subsidiary will also be able to offer the vehicles through its dealers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renault</ENAMEX> 's truck - building subsidiary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renault Vehicles Industriels</ENAMEX> will have similar rights in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DAF</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</ENAMEX> - owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">British Aerospace</ENAMEX> , with a further <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5 %</ENAMEX> held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Dutch</ENAMEX> state - owned chemical group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NV DSM</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Doorne</ENAMEX> family of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> holds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an additional 11 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DAF</ENAMEX> 's capital .
