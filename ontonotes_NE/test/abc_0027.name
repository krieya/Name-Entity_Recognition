There were a couple of indications earlier about how important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> has become as an issue in the presidential campaign .
Everyone agrees it needs fixing and if it is n't reformed , it will eventually run out of money .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> wants to modernize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> , as he puts it , by allowing workers to take a small share of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> , payroll tax , to increase themselves .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> wants to maintain the existing system .
He says he would save <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> by reducing the national debt and giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> extra money .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Martin</ENAMEX> takes a closer look from the battleground state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> .
At a small robotics company in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX> suburb , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumers</ENAMEX> , father and son , work side by side .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush 's</ENAMEX> plan to allow them to invest a small portion of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> payroll taxes in the stock market is where they part ways .
I could do with it what I want .
If I made a bad decision , then falls back on me , and I do n't have to complain about anybody else messin' my money .
It 's retirement money .
It 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> money .
If you lose it , it 's gone .
The issue comes down to this -- will voters believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore 's</ENAMEX> promise to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> the way it is ? or will they take a gamble and trust <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush 's</ENAMEX> plan to privatize part of it ?
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> voters are not sure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> will be there for them , so they are ready to take a risk .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Dubis</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</ENAMEX> , father of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> .
Giving all that money to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Sam</ENAMEX> to earn his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</ENAMEX> on it or me turning around making <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 %</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> on it , I 'd have to go that way .
That way was a simple appeal .
I just want more of a say - so of what I can do with my own money .
At a union hall , retirees worry that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is gambling with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefits .
I do n't think nobody has the option to take my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> and invest it in nothing .
It 's mine !
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> targets independents like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loretta Goehring</ENAMEX> to drive home the point that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> plan will take <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 trillion</ENAMEX> out of the system .
They got a phone message by actor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Asner</ENAMEX> .
Hi , this is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Asner</ENAMEX> .
But I do n't think we have enough money to cover both promises .
Neither candidate says how he will guarantee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security 's</ENAMEX> future , and both resist saying it will cost more money .
Do you never see the need in the future to raise taxes or cut benefits ?
I certainly hope not .
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC News</ENAMEX> poll shows voters divided on who will best protect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58 %</ENAMEX> support a plan like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this era</ENAMEX> of stock market wealth , they see his idea as an opportunity , not the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Martin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC News</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX> .
There are a lot of complexities in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> in both of these plans .
