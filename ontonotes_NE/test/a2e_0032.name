<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faisal Al Qassem</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Al Jazeera Channel</ENAMEX> presenter : I did not think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> was that impetuous ?@@@...
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shanar Bin Amer</ENAMEX>
I did not think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> was that impetuous ?
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faisal Al Qassem</ENAMEX> How foolish we were in our look to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> politicians were to many of us an example of rationality , wisdom , wit , discipline , calmness , and , above all , premeditation , deliberation , and a lack of hastiness into impetuous action that is not deliberated , especially as they are the inventers of chess , the game of the smart , the witty , and the strategic planners .
It has been known about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Persian</ENAMEX> mentality that it is innately patient , as is obvious with the makers of the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Persian</ENAMEX> carpets .
They are very patient and enduring .
They wait <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years and years</ENAMEX> and do not get bored , so that they may weave , with thread and needle , a wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Persian</ENAMEX> carpet , full of adornments , accurate details , and charming lovely figures , while <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> tend to get bored fast .
But I do not know where those historic characteristics of chess suddenly evaporated in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> policy , when the governing organization in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tehran</ENAMEX> blessed the deed of its agents in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> to execute the deceased <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> President , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> , on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day of the holy Eid Al Adha</ENAMEX> , mutilating his body , swearing and calling him names with profanity while he was on the gallows rope , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> himself had ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> media after the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Khomeini</ENAMEX> , to use the phrase " May god have mercy on him . "
Admirers of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> wisdom did not believe this fatal lapse of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> politicians and their followers .
Some might forgive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> for its yearning to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> hanged , as a type of retaliation and revenge , especially as it had fought him for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eight long years</ENAMEX> , in which it suffered <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</ENAMEX> of souls and extreme losses .
But no doubt , since it is strengthening its grip on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Hakeem</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Maliki</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Sadr</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Jaafari</ENAMEX> , who are holding the neck of an injured <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , it could have picked another more wise and less damaging time , for itself and for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> in general , to retaliate against its old rival , rather than committing a terrible deed that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> , and even all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> , would not forgive it for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tens of years</ENAMEX> , hanging him on what is a holy day for the utmost majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> .
I do not know how <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> fell in that dangerous trap , even if it were an evil <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> one , as it is known about <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> that they are smarter than to fall into <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> traps , no matter how cleverly and wittingly they are set .
But they fell this time , a terrible fall .
If I were in the place of the wise ones of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> , I would hang the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> politicians who blessed the execution of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day of the holy Eid Al Adha</ENAMEX> .
And I hope no one is overnice and says the execution was totally an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> internal affair , because this blatant joke can not even be passed on school students or the mentally retarded .
We all know that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> can just hint to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abd Al Aziz Al Hakim</ENAMEX> , who wanted to compensate it with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a hundred billion dollars</ENAMEX> from the aliment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> people for its war with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , or to the fascist militia leaders like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sadr</ENAMEX> militia , which implemented the execution judgment with the recognition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> government , to postpone the hanging , especially as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> had confirmed that they were against the execution on the holy day .
We did not hear an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> denial of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> announcements about the execution .
Even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> ambassador in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> is a liar and wants to create division between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiites</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> that would have terrible repercussions , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> could have prevented the implementation of the judgment on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day of Eid Al Adha</ENAMEX> , in order to avoid the dangerous repercussions for which they will pay the price for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tens of years</ENAMEX> , and in order to pull the carpet from beneath some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> regimes which they now accuse of provocation against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiites</ENAMEX> .
How strange the situation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> really is .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> hand , they barbarically offend the feelings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than eighty - five percent</ENAMEX> of the world 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> , and on the other hand , they accuse some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> countries of sectarian provocation against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> and their allies in the region complain that there are obvious attempts to wedge and create division between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiites</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> on the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> , and some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> .
This might be totally true ,
but if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> does not really want to inflame grudges between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiites</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> and seeks to unite the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> front and prevent its penetration on the part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Zionists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> , as it claims , why did it give the green light to its agents and militias in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> to execute <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Eid Al Adha</ENAMEX> and provide justifications on a golden plate for those who want to break down <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> on a sectarian basis ?
The story of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> is similar to the story of the one who beat me and cried , and preceded me and complained .
Do the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> have the right to complain about <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunni</ENAMEX> provocation against them , if they are the ones who started it ?
Is n't the one who starts it more unjust ?
Has n't the provocation against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> become justified after the shameful <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Adha</ENAMEX> deed ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> might be to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> the devil himself , but do they know that they turned him , in the eyes of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> , into a virtuous saint ?
Even some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kuwaitis</ENAMEX> forgave him and had sympathy for him .
Everyone forgave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> for all his faults , thanks to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> " wisdom . "
If the betrayed <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> President knew how he had become in the eyes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> world after his execution , he might have weighed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> and their agents in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> tons of praise and commendation for the great favor they did for him , of which he had never dreamed .
It reached the level that even his old objectors compared the execution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> to the assassination of our master , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar Ibn Al Khattab</ENAMEX> , at the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abi Luluah Al Majusi</ENAMEX> .
No , many even declared that his grave will become a holy shrine .
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> was left for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten more years</ENAMEX> , the man might have died naturally without any ado .
But now that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> and its agents have executed him in this horrible way , he has entered history by its widest doors , after he had exited history <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</ENAMEX> .
This was thanks to the " terrible " <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Persian</ENAMEX> " wisdom . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> was one with the utmost hatred and enmity to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Persians</ENAMEX> .
Maybe he used to pray a lot against them , and God accepted his prayers and inspired them to conspire in his execution on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> ' big feast so <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Eid Al Adha</ENAMEX> would remain connected to his name for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">decades and decades</ENAMEX> .
I do not know how the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> measured it , and I do not know why they sacrificed their tremendous popularity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> street in return for satisfying a cheap and impetuous desire for revenge .
A few <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> was a symbol of resistance , jihad , dignity , and challenge , thanks to its support of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> resistance movements like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> , while the popularity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> regimes was hitting rock bottom .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> had the right to be proud of the glorious victory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> achieved over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> .
But now , this victory has totally evaporated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> street , thanks to the stupidity of those who ordered the execution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> and the dance over his body .
No , the public support for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> has even turned into a tremendous indignation from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> and its allies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> region .
I heard a lot of people connecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Persian</ENAMEX> enemy and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Zionist</ENAMEX> enemy , while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> , until months ago , was the striker in confronting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Zionist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> project in the region .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> caused great embarrassment for everyone who has supported its positions in the past .
I have heard from a lot of people who used to defend <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> street , and they have totally turned against it and started to call it " dirty <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Persian</ENAMEX> " with a lot of loathing and hatred .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> 's performance in the war with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmadinejad</ENAMEX> 's announcements , speeches , challenge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> administration , and his insistence on finishing the process of enriching uranium , used to resurrect pride and dignity in the souls of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> .
But the scene of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> 's execution turned the tables upside down on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> for a time that might last for long ; let alone the horrible offense to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> , which lost a big portion of the street .
The proof is that its biggest supporters in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX> , for example , boycotted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Manar Channel</ENAMEX> , which used to have great popularity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> street .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> , with their spirit of revenge , have destroyed the most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> resistance movement , after it was filling the world and occupying the minds of humans .
They even turned the people against it .
No matter how the answers vary , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed Abu Roman</ENAMEX> debates , what is obvious is that the image of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein 's</ENAMEX> execution would cost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> a lot in the next stage .
It will make its credibility very weak , and it will also harm the image of its ally powers in various countries .
In addition , it revealed that the " <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Persian</ENAMEX> - national " spirit that tinctures <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> 's foreign policy and its various positions , far from the claims of enmity to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> , are only used to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> 's interests .
Beyond that , the image of executing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> and the repercussions it created cause a large embarrassment for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> 's allies in the region , like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Al Jihad</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> , and many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> factions , as well as the political and public powers - in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> countries - which stood with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> and were calling for their governments to " change " their alliances to stand with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> .
These powers face a state of strong embarrassment , similar to the embarrassment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> regimes friendly with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> from its policies in the region .
Those who wanted to quench their thirst for revenge by hanging <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first of the Adha holy days</ENAMEX> are like the libidinous fool who satisfied his cheap lust without knowing that he had caught a dangerous disease afterward .
What did they win ?
