Make this final port call for some of these men and women on board who have been there for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten months</ENAMEX> at sea .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chad Myers</ENAMEX> joining me on the set .
Typical perfect day in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> waiting for these men and women to come home .
Raining in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.a.</ENAMEX> , raining in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> but nice in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> .
It 's a picture perfect place to live .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</ENAMEX> and sunny <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">just about every day</ENAMEX> .
Have you ever been down there ?
No , I have not .
It is quite stunning .
It is beautiful out there .
I just think about all the family members sitting at home , sitting on the dock looking at this boat coming in .
It 's just amazing .
They were not on vacation .
They were in danger .
Your loved ones are in danger for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten months</ENAMEX> .
Is he okay <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> ?
Is she okay <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> ?
Incredible sight to see these young men and women .
They are children .
They are <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">18 , 19 , 20 years old</ENAMEX> .
Think about when I was doing when I was 18 , I was thinking about going to college .
These guys are running ships .
Some of these , as you say , are children .
Some of these had children while they were out at sea and this is the first time that -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> opportunity to get home and meet and hold them .
We 've seen the reunions for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">the past week</ENAMEX> or so .
It brings a lot of emotion .
It 's going to be hard for me to hold back tears .
We 're watching from the sidelines .
You can just imagine what these people must be thinking and how antsy they must be .
Got to think <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the last five minutes</ENAMEX> must feel like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</ENAMEX> as they 've spent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten months</ENAMEX> on the water .
Just about to come home .
Sense the anticipation there beginning to build on those docks .
Friend of mine in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richmond</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> , on the radio up there <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WRBA</ENAMEX> .
His son was on one of the ships that escorted a carrier , although this came home by itself from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> .
There are so many other ships out there that escort this ship as it goes out .
It 's just not one ship , not just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</ENAMEX> people .
It is a battle group that goes out .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</ENAMEX> ships and a submarine .
While some of these ladies and gentlemen are going to be joining their families <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> of them are going to stay on board because this -- the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lincoln</ENAMEX> '' is going to be docked in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Everett</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
That 's where the home base is .
It 's going to have to make a trip up the coast .
They wo n't get to see their loved ones until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> .
I wonder who gets to get off first .
Is there a drawing ?
Was there a raffle ?
We 've got to deal with the person who 's going to be getting off here .
As you 've been watching throughout the morning , you 've been seeing that balloon , just getting back from spending a tour in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> during the war .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX> is going to be leaving us .
She is jumping ship .
She is going on her own .
She was one of the water skiers .
We have to let her go .
She is going to be leaving us .
She 'll be leave G -- we do wish you the best , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX> .
You know that .
It 's been a blast having you , been a pain in the butt sometimes , been big part of our group the entire time .
Love you , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX> .
Thank you , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon</ENAMEX> .
We 're going to say good-bye to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX> .
Some of these ladies and gentlemen are going to be saying hello to their families , standing on the side of the ship , ca n't wait to get off there .
We 'll have that for you live .
These reunions .
That should be happening any moment now .
Stay with us .
