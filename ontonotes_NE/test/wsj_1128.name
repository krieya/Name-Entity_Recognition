<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soichiro Honda 's</ENAMEX> picture now hangs with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Ford 's</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Automotive Hall of Fame</ENAMEX> , and the game - show `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jeopardy</ENAMEX> '' is soon to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> - owned .
But no matter how much <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> gets under our skin , we 'll still have mom and apple pie .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> thought , make that just mom .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> apple called the Fuji is cropping up in orchards the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hondas</ENAMEX> did on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> roads .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> it will be planted more often than any other apple tree , according to a recent survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> apple - industry sages by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington State University</ENAMEX> horticulturist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Norton</ENAMEX> .
Some fruit visionaries say the Fuji could someday tumble the Red Delicious from the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's apple heap .
It certainly wo n't get there on looks .
Compared to the Red Delicious , the exemplar of apple pulchritude , the Fuji is decidedly more dowdy -- generally smaller , less - perfectly shaped , greenish , with tinges of red .
To hear most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> growers tell it , we 'd still be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Paradise</ENAMEX> if the serpent had proffered one to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX> .
But how sweet it is .
It has more sugar `` than any apple we 've ever tested , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duane Greene</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">University of Massachusetts</ENAMEX> pomologist , or apple scholar .
It has a long shelf life and `` does n't fool the public , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grady Auvil</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orondo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wash.</ENAMEX> , grower who is planting Fujis and spreading the good word about them .
`` It does n't look nice on the outside while getting mealy inside . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auvil</ENAMEX> , razor sharp at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">83</ENAMEX> , has picked and packed <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a zillion pecks</ENAMEX> of apples over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 65 years</ENAMEX> .
He is known as the father of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - grown Granny Smith , a radically different apple that the conventional wisdom once said would never catch on .
It did , shaking the apple establishment to its roots .
Now , even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> apples plays the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiroshi Appleseed</ENAMEX> .
`` The Fuji is going to be No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> to replace the Red Delicious , '' he says .
The Delicious hegemony wo n't end anytime soon .
New apple trees grow slowly , and the Red Delicious is almost as entrenched as mom .
Its roots are patriotic -- with the first trees appearing in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1872</ENAMEX> in an orchard near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> , to be exact .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 50 years</ENAMEX> , it has been the apple of our eye .
A good Delicious can indeed be delicious .
More than twice as many Red Delicious apples are grown as the Golden variety , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> apple .
But the apple industry is ripe for change .
`` Red Delicious has been overplanted , and its prices have dropped below the cost of production , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington State 's</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norton</ENAMEX> .
The scare over Alar , a growth regulator that makes apples redder and crunchier but may be carcinogenic , made consumers shy away from the Delicious , though they were less affected than the McIntosh .
The glut and consequent lower prices , combined with cancer fears , was a very serious blow to growers .
`` A lot of growers wo n't be around in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</ENAMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norton</ENAMEX> , although they have stopped using Alar .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> may be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Broderick</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sterling</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , grower .
`` This is beautiful stuff , '' he says , looking ruefully at big boxes of just - picked Red Delicious next to his barn .
`` But I 'm going to lose <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50,000 to $ 60,000</ENAMEX> on it .
I 'm going to have to get another job <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> just to eat . ''
Besides rotten prices , he has been hit recently by hail , a bark - nibbling horde of mice , fungi and bugs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 500</ENAMEX> insects and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</ENAMEX> diseases wiggle , chew and romp through growers ' nightmares , including maggots , mites , mildew , thrips , black rot and the flat - headed borer .
Even if a grower beats them back , his $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,000</ENAMEX> rented bees might buzz off to the neighbors ' orchards instead of pollinating his , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broderick</ENAMEX> says .
Though growers ca n't always keep the worm from the apple , they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying -- into the recently imported Gala , a sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> native ; the Esopus Spitzenburg , reportedly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jefferson 's</ENAMEX> favorite apple ; disease - resistant kinds like the Liberty .
`` I 've ripped out a lot of Delicious '' and grafted the trees with many different shoots , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Wood</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Lebanon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.H.</ENAMEX> , grower , tramping through his <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 - acre</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Poverty Lane Orchard</ENAMEX> on a crisp <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn day</ENAMEX> recently .
`` I 've got <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</ENAMEX> kinds of apples .
Here 's a Waltana , '' he exclaims , picking one off a tree .
He bites it , scowls and throws it down . ``
It 's a real dog . ''
Supermarkets are getting into the variety act , too .
They still buy apples mainly for big , red good looks -- that 's why so many taste like woodchucks ' punching bags .
But freshness counts more than it once did , and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional , but tastier , and often pricier , apples .
`` Rather than sell <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">39 - cents</ENAMEX> - a - pound Delicious , maybe we can sell <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">79 - cents</ENAMEX> - a - pound Fujis , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuck Tryon</ENAMEX> , perishables director for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Super Valu Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> supermarket chain and food distributor .
The Fuji is a product of meticulous <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> pomological engineering , which fostered it <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years ago</ENAMEX> at a government research orchard .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> researchers have bred <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</ENAMEX> of strains of Fujis to hone its color , taste and shelf life .
Now the best of them age as gracefully as Grannies , the industry 's gold standard for storability .
In the cornucopia of go - go apples , the Fuji 's track record stands out : During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 15 years</ENAMEX> , it has gone from almost zilch to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">some 50 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's market .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> apple market is very keyed to high quality , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Lane</ENAMEX> , a scientist at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> horticulture research center in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Summerland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> , and so apples are more of a delicacy there than a big food commodity .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Department of Agriculture</ENAMEX> estimates that this year <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> will eat <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40 %</ENAMEX> more fresh apples per capita than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> .
The Fuji is still small potatoes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , sold mainly in fruit boutiques .
But in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig Ito</ENAMEX> , a Fuji - apple grower , `` There 's a Fuji apple cult .
Once somebody eats one , they get hooked . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auvil</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> grower , says that he could sell Fujis to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> buyers at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">40</ENAMEX> a box if he had them .
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> already is a big importer of Fujis from other places , he adds . -RRB-
But his first crop wo n't be picked till <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
`` I expect to see the demand exceed supply for Fujis for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 10 to 15 years</ENAMEX> , '' he adds .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> Red Delicious , by the way , are wholesaling for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 10</ENAMEX> a box <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auvil</ENAMEX> sees Fujis , in part , as striking a blow against the perversion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> apples by supermarkets .
`` When the chain stores took over , there was no longer a connection between grower and consumer .
A guy is sitting up in an office deciding what you 're going to eat . ''
After all , until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</ENAMEX> even the Red Delicious was a firm , delectable morsel .
Then , as growers bred them more for looks , and to satisfy supermarket chains ' demands of long - term storage , the Red went into decline .
Now , those red applelike things stores sell in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</ENAMEX> are fruitbowl lovely , but usually not good eating .
They do deserve respect , however -- they are almost a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> old , probably equal to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about 106 in human years</ENAMEX> .
The Fuji , to be sure , has blemishes too .
It ripens later than most apples , and growing it in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> areas with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">chilly autumns</ENAMEX> may be tricky .
Moreover , the frumpy Fuji must compete with an increasingly dolledup Delicious .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broderick</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> grower , says the `` big boss '' at a supermarket chain even rejected his Red Delicious recently because they were n't waxed and brushed for extra shine .
And he had n't used hormones , which many growers employ to elongate their Delicious apples for greater eye appeal .
Still , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auvil</ENAMEX> points out , Grannies became popular without big , red looks , so why not Fujis ?
He sees a shift in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> values -- at least regarding apples -- toward more emphasis on substance and less on glitz .
`` Taste has finally come to the fore , '' he says .
Or , for that matter , the core .
