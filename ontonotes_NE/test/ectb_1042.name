It 's the " Knowledge - Based " Economy , Stupid !
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Li</ENAMEX> / photos by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Lin</ENAMEX> / tr. by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Newell</ENAMEX> -RRB-
A saying has it that " knowledge is power . "
But here at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</ENAMEX> , people are discovering that knowledge is more than just power ; it is also profit .
Responding to the new realities , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Executive Yuan</ENAMEX> has put forward a plan to develop <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's " knowledge - based economy " which aims to double per capita income within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</ENAMEX> .
This plan embraces the long-term economic goals of the new administration .
But what is covered under the rubric of developing the knowledge - based economy ?
What conditions are required to be successful ?
Does <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> meet these criteria ?
Did you know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 %</ENAMEX> of the knowledge in the world has been produced in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the half century</ENAMEX> since the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> ?
And in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</ENAMEX> , what we know <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> will be only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">one percent</ENAMEX> of the total knowledge bank of our children !
" It is estimated that the pool of human knowledge doubled once every <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifty</ENAMEX> years in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</ENAMEX> , and about once every <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</ENAMEX> years in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</ENAMEX> .
Now it doubles once every <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three to five</ENAMEX> years , " notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Se-hwa</ENAMEX> , dean of the business school at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Chengchi University</ENAMEX> .
The explosive growth of information is the most distinctive feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</ENAMEX> , and has brought sweeping changes to the world 's political , social , and economic structure .
Profit defines value
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> , shortly after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> took office , he declared that emphasis should be placed on research and development and on creating a " new economy . "
It turns out that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these last eight years</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> have been a golden age of high economic growth , falling unemployment , and stable prices .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OECD</ENAMEX> coined the term " knowledge - based economy , " and many governments have jumped on the bandwagon since .
You can call it the " new economy " or the " knowledge - based economy " or whatever , but what is it really ?
How can such an economy be created ?
Because each country has different development needs , there are many different answers to these questions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Se-hwa</ENAMEX> points out that the term " knowledge - based economy " refers to any economic activity based on the production or application of knowledge , in which " knowledge " includes all kinds of technology , patents , management know-how , and individual creations .
It is not important how profound or esoteric the knowledge may be ; what matters most is turning that knowledge into a product which can earn a profit .
Looking back at the economic history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">16th century</ENAMEX> society , agricultural products were the key to wealth and power .
Whoever had the most , and most fertile , land was in a dominant position .
In the industrial age , capitalists who commanded the wealth to buy machinery and hire workers , or who owned critical resources like coal and oil , replaced landowners as the dominant figures in the economy .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , whoever owns systematized knowledge will win out over his or her competitors .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lester Thurow</ENAMEX> , the well - known economist from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> , came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> to give a lecture <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a half year ago</ENAMEX> , he pointed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Microsoft Corporation</ENAMEX> as a prime example : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Microsoft</ENAMEX> owns no farmland , no oil fields , no expensive and sophisticated factories , and no shops of its own .
Its product fits onto a tiny microchip .
Yet this company , relying only on the brainpower of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several thousand</ENAMEX> engineers sitting in front of computers writing programs , has earned <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions upon billions of dollars</ENAMEX> for owner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX> .
It is estimated that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300 million</ENAMEX> persons use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Microsoft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Windows</ENAMEX> each day around the world , with annual revenues reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 25 billion</ENAMEX> .
Knowledge petrie dish
In the past , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> people discovered much knowledge and invented much technology , but , influenced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Confucian</ENAMEX> belief that profit was not a worthy application of wisdom , never converted these into commercial products .
But in the face of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's dramatic global economic transformation , there is no choice but to try to turn knowledge into profit .
And the thing that links knowledge with profit is information technology -LRB- IT -RRB- .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu Wen-hsing</ENAMEX> , founder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Smartek Engineering</ENAMEX> , whose company has twice won national awards in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> for its fingerprint verification device , says that human history can be seen as the history of information .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marco Polo</ENAMEX> visited the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</ENAMEX> , if he had not left a written account of his travels , it would have been a virtually wasted trip .
The recent enthusiasm for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> exhibition of terracotta warriors from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xi'an</ENAMEX> is due to the fact that these long - buried figures contain information about mysteries dating back <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2000 years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu Wen-hsing</ENAMEX> points out that in the past information was always tied to material objects , and remained in the hands of the few .
When the material objects disappeared , so did the information they contained .
But now , thanks to IT , for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time in history information can be forever stored in huge volume , ready and waiting to be manipulated , exchanged , and even sent across great distances .
IT is like a petrie dish .
Information cells swim around in it , and can divide , recombine , reproduce , and copy themselves without limit , opening up entirely new possibilities for the accumulation and application of knowledge .
For example , computers are capable of finding numbers hidden under or scattered throughout a huge pile of data which is impenetrable to the human brain , and can analyze and clarify these numbers into useful know-how .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> order form is not information .
But , by using a computer to save , connect , and search individual order forms , one can draw a thread through <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</ENAMEX> of them , and discern their regularities and variations .
Now that 's knowledge , " declares <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Chang</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Acer CyberCenter Services</ENAMEX> .
At a glance you can find information such as regional and seasonal variations in sales , or market acceptance of a given product .
And if there is a problem , it can be identified immediately , avoiding guesswork and wasted time .
Everyone a multibillionaire !
In the information world , everyone is equal .
Though huge multinational corporations may have an edge in terms of information technology , since the rapid growth of the Internet in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</ENAMEX> , ' little guys ' whom no one has ever heard of before - relying only on programming ability , creativity , and hard work - have had the space to bring their talents into play .
The best - known example is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yahoo</ENAMEX> , the world 's number <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> web portal .
It all started with two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Stanford</ENAMEX> PhD students looking for a way to categorize the websites online , who came up with a great idea for a way to make finding information easier for Internet users .
With this idea , after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</ENAMEX> of hard work , today <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yahoo</ENAMEX> has a market value of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 50 billion</ENAMEX> .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five years</ENAMEX> profits have grown at a rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9800 %</ENAMEX> , which has got to be some kind of record .
However , though knowledge may be profitable , its value is subject to severe fluctuation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Tsao</ENAMEX> , assistant vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Knowledge Management Center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Winbond Electronics Corporation</ENAMEX> , notes that in the past you could determine the worth of a company by adding up its fixed assets -LRB- such as land and factories -RRB- and liquid assets -LRB- such as cash -RRB- , with each calculable down to the last penny .
But knowledge is intangible .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> different software packages burned onto identical chips can have grossly different values .
Sometimes it all depends on luck or fads .
The dramatic rise and fall of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> software stocks <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this past year</ENAMEX> reflects the difficulty of assessing the value of knowledge .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Se-hwa</ENAMEX> points to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intel</ENAMEX> as a prime example of how knowledge can " convert silicon to gold . "
A name - card sized CPU is in fact just a chipboard with complicated circuitry , with a unit cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than US$ 35</ENAMEX> .
But because it includes unique information that makes the computer run , and carries the authority of " Intel inside , " it can fetch over US$ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1000</ENAMEX> in the marketplace , many times the cost of production .
What about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> ?
Clearly there is already a global trend in which an information economy is taking shape .
What advantages does <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> have for playing a larger role in this realm ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Chang</ENAMEX> , who left the job of director of planning at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Science Council</ENAMEX> only <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six months ago</ENAMEX> to enter the private sector , points out that the knowledge - based economy basically deals in information technology , and the IT industry is the most profitable region in the emerging geography of the knowledge - based economy .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> currently ranks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> in the world in value of IT production , and , if you include the plants established by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> investors across the globe , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> - controlled firms lead the world in manufacturing of IT hardware .
In other words , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> has a solid manufacturing base and a large pool of high quality human resources on which it can rely to develop the knowledge - based economy .
Also , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> has a strong education system .
The results of a recent international survey measuring the performance of junior high school students in natural sciences and math show that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> kids finished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> in the former and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> -LRB- behind only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> -RRB- in the latter .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Chang</ENAMEX> , CEO of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CyberLink Corporation</ENAMEX> , whose firm has become a much - coveted new entry in the stock market and has drawn international attention with audio-visual software like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Power DVD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Talking Show</ENAMEX> , says : " Talented people are at the root of knowledge . "
AV software is very difficult to produce , and staff must have a solid grounding in math .
This is where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> is at an advantage .
However , though <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> has its strong points , there are also a number of problems and shortcomings .
" The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> thing to consider , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Se-hwa</ENAMEX> , " is this :
What kind of knowledge - based economy is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> most suited to ? "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> says that right now what the government is focusing on and what stock market players most hope for is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> - style " new economy . "
The focus is on new industries , such as software and the Internet , or communications technology , fiber - optics , biotechnology , and the like .
But can the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> model be reproduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> ?
There is little reason to be optimistic .
The new economy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> depends heavily , for one thing , on a deep foundation of basic scientific research , which comes up with revolutionary products like genetically modified foods .
Another key factor is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> has a mechanism for innovation and entrepreneurship , so that new ideas have a chance to be brought into play .
The rapid growth in the new economy has driven a decade - long economic boom in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX> .
The old manufacturing economy has naturally been trimmed back , with factories relocating overseas , but <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> firms can depend on the rights to technology to earn a profit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearl Tan</ENAMEX> , public relations manager at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Applied Materials Taiwan</ENAMEX> , a subsidiary of the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> semiconductor equipment manufacturer of the same name , points to a prime example : DRAM , the hottest industry in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , which was a monopoly of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tan</ENAMEX> notes that although DRAM factories are closing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> after another in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , patent royalties must still be paid to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas</ENAMEX> Instruments for each and every <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100 million</ENAMEX> DRAMs produced around the world annually .
This is a classic " knowledge goose that lays golden eggs . "
The new economy is a weapon by which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> dominates the world , with " the export of knowledge " replacing the export of goods .
Yet , in the entire world , only the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> export more technology than they import .
In other words , only these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> countries have a surplus in " knowledge trade , " and can make money by selling knowledge .
Of these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> income from selling technology is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> times the amount it spends buying technology elsewhere , and it earns enough each year in patent royalties to balance its enormous deficit in manufactured goods .
In contrast , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> is still showing a nasty deficit in knowledge trade , with money going out twice as fast as it is coming in .
The impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> model would certainly be difficult to apply to the small " shallow " economy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ko Chen-en</ENAMEX> , dean of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the College of Management</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Taiwan University</ENAMEX> , puts it : " You merely have to ask how many <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize</ENAMEX> winners <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> has - not many - and you know its real ability to follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> economic model . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ko</ENAMEX> relates that " high-risk and high-profit " revolutionary new technologies can normally only be created with enormous financial backing .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</ENAMEX> , total expenditures on R-AMP-D in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> by both the government and private sector were a mere <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 200 billion</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about US $ 6 billion</ENAMEX> -RRB- , less than was spent by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> alone .
Slow improvement
In contrast to the " picking stars from the sky " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> model , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Se-hwa</ENAMEX> , " the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> knowledge - based economy concept is closer to what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> needs . "
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> explains , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OECD</ENAMEX> definition of the knowledge - based economy embraces all kinds of industries , from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Italian</ENAMEX> shoes to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Dutch</ENAMEX> flowers .
Any industry that increases its knowledge component , using knowledge to improve management , innovate , or improve quality , can be considered a knowledge industry .
This is a much more practical ambition for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , which has a high proportion of traditional industry and is extremely dependent on OEM manufacturing to make money .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 4500</ENAMEX> patents approved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , ranking fourth .
But not many of these were for original discoveries ; most were in the category of improvements of old ideas , mainly ways to increase efficiency in the manufacturing process .
Innovations that are improvements require less money for R-AMP-D , and do not require genius-like creativity , but can be made primarily by devoting more attention to a specific problem .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.T. Day</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Association of Small and Medium Enterprises of the ROC</ENAMEX> , and chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the San Sun Hat and Cap Company</ENAMEX> , takes the following case in point : On most caps there is an " eyelet " in the stitching .
But , because of different machine designs , the gap can be <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> stitches , creating problems for quality control .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">San Sun</ENAMEX> created a computer program that ensures that machines leave a uniform gap of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</ENAMEX> stitches , and even gets the machines to tie a lovely knot when the sticthcing is completed .
This seemingly small improvement actually allows the firm to charge double the unit price per hat .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Day</ENAMEX> has factories in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dominica</ENAMEX> .
Wages in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> times greater than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PRC</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> times greater than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burma</ENAMEX> .
" If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> workers just make hats and do nothing else , then it does n't pay .
But if , because of their higher quality , these workers come up with their own ideas for improving the production process , then they are worth it , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Day</ENAMEX> with the voice of experience .
He says that in assessing the value of employees , you have to look at more than just the value of the product ; you have to also take into account its " intelligence " value .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">San Sun</ENAMEX> insists it will not lay off any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> workers , nor will it hire foreign laborers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , and its sales have not suffered as a result .
Indeed , orders through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October of 2000</ENAMEX> showed an increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VIA</ENAMEX> con dios
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VIA Technologies</ENAMEX> , a stock market powerhouse in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> which has made a tremendous impact in the chipset market <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these past two years</ENAMEX> , and which is even threatening the dominant position of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intel</ENAMEX> , has adopted a different strategy for gradually expanding its territory .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lee</ENAMEX> , who works in public relations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VIA</ENAMEX> , says that the production of chipsets is a high risk activity .
So , taking advantage of the boom in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> stock market over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</ENAMEX> , the company went on a binge of hiring , acquisitions , and strategic alliances , expanding in size rapidly .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> says that in the past , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VIA</ENAMEX> 's chipsets were designed completely to support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intel</ENAMEX> specification CPUs .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intel</ENAMEX> insisted on sticking with expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rambus</ENAMEX> memory chips despite a poor market response , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VIA</ENAMEX> saw its opportunity :
It began promoting use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the P133 memory chip</ENAMEX> , which had been created by an international consortium and was provided to factories free of charge .
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VIA</ENAMEX> had challenged the " big boss , " <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intel</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the latter half of 1999</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VIA</ENAMEX> acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> CPU companies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX> , giving it an independent ability to develop CPUs .
In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">half a year ago</ENAMEX> it entered into cooperation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> graphics powerhouse S3 to make graphics chips .
In these ways , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VIA</ENAMEX> is moving step by step to enlarge its intellectual holdings .
" You have to have a lot of technology already on hand before you can start talking about systematic integration and trying out major innovations , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> .
It is only now that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VIA</ENAMEX> can escape from the specifications dictated by large multinational firms , and create innovative products of its own .
To meet future market demand for home appliances that are inexpensive , multi-functional , and portable , the main direction will be to get all the functions on to a single chip .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VIA</ENAMEX> has designed a new <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</ENAMEX> - in - <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> chipset which includes CPU , memory , and graphics , which are expected to formally hit the market in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half of 2001</ENAMEX> .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> reveals : " No one has ever done this before .
We are trying something new . "
Save the idiots !
Nonetheless , knowledge and creativity are intangible , and it is not always easy to determine ownership .
This is especially problematic in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , where some people still do n't have a very clear idea about intellectual property rights , and legal protections are less than comprehensive .
This is a potential problem for the development of the knowledge - based economy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
" Many innovations just represent going a little bit further in thinking about a problem than the other guys , and once the secret is uncovered , it is easy for them to copy the idea , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Chang</ENAMEX> .
The most famous example in the industry involves a certain company that wanted to create information systems like storage and document handling .
It invited a number of information industry firms to give briefings on their products .
After a while , this former " outsider " became an insider , and created its own product , congratulating itself on saving so much money in the process .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Chang</ENAMEX> notes that a major innovation usually is nested in a lot of small innovations .
If small innovations are not recognized , or do not get appropriate market rewards , this will destroy the motivation to innovate at all .
This is precisely the problem now being faced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Comdek</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> company in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> to produce medical instruments such as blood - oxygen monitors and ear thermometers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Y.S. Kuo</ENAMEX> , general manager at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Comdek</ENAMEX> , points out that the quick and easy process of taking body temperature through the ear was developed by an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> company , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boehringer-Ingelheim</ENAMEX> paid a huge amount of money for the patent so they could begin production .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Comdek</ENAMEX> took the basic principle , and went to work on it , eventually coming up with their own version , for which they have been awarded a patent .
But when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Comdek</ENAMEX> 's product came out , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kuo</ENAMEX> still found himself in a vicious struggle with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> pirate firms : " It 's equivalent to making fools out of those of us who invest the money to do research and development ! "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuo</ENAMEX> says that while there has been some improvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> with regard to protection of intellectual property rights , there is still not enough for those who invest in development and innovation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Comdek</ENAMEX> has closed its laboratory and production line to any outside visits , and has not ruled out the possibility of moving its lab overseas to get away from industrial espionage in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
Looking for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald</ENAMEX> 's
Espionage reflects a lack of respect for knowledge .
But there is also the problem of insufficient awareness of the potential value of knowledge , so that , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Se-hwa</ENAMEX> says , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> firms " are sitting on a mountain of gold , but do n't know that they can sell what they know for hard cash . "
" The most ' classic ' form of knowledge product is one in which the intangible value of the knowledge transcends the tangible value of the product , and can be reproduced in large volume at low cost , thus earning huge profits . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> points to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> coffee shop chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Starbucks</ENAMEX> .
Can they really make huge profits just by selling cups of coffee for a couple of bucks ?
Of course not .
The headquarters company in fact spends most of its time handling the sale of franchise rights worldwide .
What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Starbucks</ENAMEX> sells is not coffee , but " the knowledge of how to run a coffee shop . "
The same logic applies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonalds</ENAMEX> :
Who does n't know how to draw their " golden arches " trademark ?
It does n't seem to require any great wisdom to have a bright and clean store with fast - food service , but when you link this simple product together with a trademark , powerful name recognition , and high quality control , the result has swept the globe .
Now <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 20,000</ENAMEX> franchises worldwide work to expand the company 's territory while the headquarters takes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5 %</ENAMEX> of operating revenues as its share for as long as the franchise lasts .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> firms have increasingly invested abroad , the " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> experience " has penetrated deeply into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> and mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
In both the manufacturing and service sectors , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> businessmen have proven adept at flexibly adapting to local society .
But now that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> methods are well understood and widely copied , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> investors are being dropped by their local partners .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> companies do n't understand how to ensure their earnings from management knowledge and company name recognition , and are not in the habit of selling rights or earning royalties , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> with regret , as he offers the following examples : <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> department stores are a cut above <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PRC</ENAMEX> state - run stores , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's construction industry has the knack for systematic management , and even industries like eel - raising have their own technologies and operating methods , but people only think about keeping these secrets to themselves and making money by working on their own .
They do n't know how to spread knowledge so that others will make money for them !
Of course , to sell operational know-how , this knowledge must be converted into steps , systems , and standards , and must be well - packaged .
And trademarks and patents must be employed to deter potential pirates .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> suggests that organizations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> which are dedicated to teaching management methods , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the China Productivity Center</ENAMEX> , should assist companies in systematizing and selling the rights to their mangement and operating philosophies , so that the uniquely flexible <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> approach to business can be reproduced and marketed worldwide .
" If only people would change their attitudes , the knowledge - based economy could have many new components , and every industry , firm , or individual could find an opportunity to make money on this new frontier , "
concludes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> .
Looking to the future , the road to a knowledge - based economy is long , but it is the only choice for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
What is most important now is to remove obstacles from the path , and to make each stride as large and quick as possible .
