Probably the most clear - cut <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> violation , for example , is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> radar .
-- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arms Control Reality</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 20 , 1984</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 20</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> editorials saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> violated the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ABM</ENAMEX> treaty .
-- `` Whether the installation is for early warning or space track , it clearly is not deployed , '' the lawmakers said .
`` Thus we judge it to be not a violation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ABM</ENAMEX> treaty at this time . ''
The delegation included a reporter from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Times</ENAMEX> , aides to Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward M. Kennedy</ENAMEX> and Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les AuCoin</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Natural Resources Defense Council</ENAMEX> staff members .
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Washington Post</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 9 , 1987</ENAMEX> .
-- The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> has taken unprecedented unilateral measures of openness , by giving <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> representatives a possibility to inspect the building site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> radar as well as radar vans in the areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gomel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> , so as to see for themselves that there are no violations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ABM</ENAMEX> treaty of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</ENAMEX> on the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
-- Letter from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.N.</ENAMEX> Secretary - General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perez de Cuellar</ENAMEX> , reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tass</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 10 , 1988</ENAMEX> .
-- The construction of this station equal in size to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptian</ENAMEX> pyramids constituted , I say it directly , a clear violation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ABM</ENAMEX> .
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 23 , 1989</ENAMEX> .
We 're happy , we guess , to receive confirmation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> violation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> after we started writing about it .
Perhaps even the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> apologists will now accede .
Without question , something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Politburo</ENAMEX> .
As it bids for new agreements , new loans and indeed admission to the civilized world , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> government has recognized it has a credibility problem .
So after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">70 years</ENAMEX> , it is confessing the obvious , hoping to be believed about other things .
It 's not enough .
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> want to be believed , they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious .
Our own test of `` glasnost 's '' authenticity would be a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> decision to open itself to a complete international examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the most troubling mysteries in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - Soviet relations -- the reported <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</ENAMEX> anthrax outbreak at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> military facility in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government has never waivered in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there , and hence a violation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Biological Weapons Convention</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> 's recently issued `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Soviet Military Power</ENAMEX> , '' though in general adopting a softer line , repeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> assessment .
It also was detailed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congressional</ENAMEX> testimony <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this past February</ENAMEX> : An explosion at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Microbiology and Virology Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> released anthrax germs that caused a significant number of deaths .
Since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> did not address this topic before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Soviet</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union 's</ENAMEX> official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat .
We doubt this claim just as we doubted Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> 's assurance <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> did n't violate the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ABM</ENAMEX> treaty .
And just as we did not believe the tendentious claims of the Congressmen and arms - control advocates who visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> , we are in no way persuaded by the assent to the tainted - meat theory by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> team of scientists who met with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> counterparts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> ' explanation is that the anthrax came from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> lot of animal feed made from the bones of cattle that grazed on soil that was naturally infected with anthrax spores .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvard</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Meselson</ENAMEX> -- who we read has sold something called the `` scientific community '' on the notion that `` yellow rain '' attacks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Laotian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hmong</ENAMEX> were in fact the result of fecal showers by giant bees -- found the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> anthrax scenario `` completely plausible . ''
We do n't believe it .
And we certainly do not believe that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> or any of his emissaries yet deserve to have the West take their word for it .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms - control process itself .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> complaint , as with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> , is no mere political posturing .
Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate , and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government .
But the stated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> position is detailed and specific , and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> violated the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</ENAMEX> agreement or , alternatively , that would give <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident .
Until that happens , glasnost can not begin to deserve the kind of credibility Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> was bidding for with his confessions on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
