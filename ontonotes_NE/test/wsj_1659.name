The television units of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paramount Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX> are exploring the possibility of offering prime - time programming to independent stations <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">two nights</ENAMEX> a week , industry executives say .
Although such a venture would n't match the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> network '' created by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">News Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paramount</ENAMEX> may have similar ambitions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> , which also owns <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> TV stations , provides programs <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">three nights</ENAMEX> a week to those and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">affiliates</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paramount Domestic TV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCA TV</ENAMEX> formed a joint venture <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> , named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Premier Advertiser Sales</ENAMEX> , to sell advertising in programs syndicated by both companies , such as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Star Trek : the Next Generation</ENAMEX> , '' `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Charles in Charge</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Friday the 13th : the Series</ENAMEX> . ''
A spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paramount</ENAMEX> said the company does n't comment on speculation .
Calls to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelly Schwab</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCA TV</ENAMEX> , were n't returned .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> companies , like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> , already have their own TV stations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCA</ENAMEX> owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WWOR</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paramount</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> agreed to purchase a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79 %</ENAMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the TVX Broadcast Group</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX> in a deal valued at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 140 million</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVX</ENAMEX> owns <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> stations , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WTXF</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> affiliate , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> broadcasting executive familiar with the project said the co-venture would target stations affiliated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> has the desirable independent stations in most of the key cities .
Currently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> supplies programs on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Mondays</ENAMEX> , although the company plans to expand to other <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">weeknights</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Kellner</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox Broadcasting</ENAMEX> , said , `` We believe the partnership of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> , its affiliates and advertisers is succeeding and will continue to grow . ''
Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> official , who declined to be identified , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> was n't pleased by the possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paramount</ENAMEX> - MCA venture into prime - time programming .
`` To make the venture work , they would need <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> affiliates , '' he said .
`` We spent a lot of time and money in building our group of stations , '' he said , adding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> does n't `` appreciate '' another company attempting to usurp its station lineup .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> said it plans to offer its stations movies , theatrical and made - for - TV ventures , probably on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesdays</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">sometime next year</ENAMEX> .
It is also planning <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">another night</ENAMEX> of original series .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paramount</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCA</ENAMEX> , according to the broadcasting executive , plan to offer theatrical movies produced separately by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paramount</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCA</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesdays</ENAMEX> and perhaps a block of original shows <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Fridays</ENAMEX> .
The executive said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paramount</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCA</ENAMEX> have also held discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chris - Craft Industries '</ENAMEX> broadcasting unit , which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> independent stations in cities such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ore</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chris - Craft</ENAMEX> station manager said there have been no formal talks .
`` I think it 's to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> 's advantage to be associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paramount</ENAMEX> - MCA venture , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Conway</ENAMEX> , station manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WTXF</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVX</ENAMEX> station that is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> affiliate .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conway</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> shows appearing on <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paramount</ENAMEX> - MCA shows would n't be offered could be promoted on the programs produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paramount</ENAMEX> - MCA .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Fisher</ENAMEX> , general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KTXL</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> affiliate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sacramento</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , said , `` The real question is whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paramount</ENAMEX> - MCA offering is practical .
It is n't ... .
Why would I consider giving up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> , a proven commodity , '' for an unknown venture ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox</ENAMEX> attracts a young audience with shows such as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Married ... With Children</ENAMEX> , '' its most successful series .
