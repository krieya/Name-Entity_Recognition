Blue - chip advertisers have plenty of complaints about the magazines they advertise in , ranging from inadequate consumer research to ad `` clutter '' and a seemingly unchecked proliferation of special interest magazines .
Criticism from such big advertisers as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Estee Lauder Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Colgate - Palmolive Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Seagram Co.</ENAMEX> put a damper on the euphoria at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the American Magazine Conference</ENAMEX> here .
The conference opened <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> with glowing reports about consumer magazines ' growth in circulation and advertising revenue in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</ENAMEX> .
`` Magazines are not providing us in - depth information on circulation , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edgar Bronfman Jr.</ENAMEX> , president and chief operating officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Seagram</ENAMEX> , in a panel discussion .
`` How do readers feel about the magazine ?
How deeply do they read it ?
Research does n't tell us whether people actually do read the magazines they subscribe to . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reuben Mark</ENAMEX> , chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Colgate - Palmolive</ENAMEX> , said advertisers lack detailed demographic and geographic breakdowns of magazines ' audiences .
`` We need research that convinces us that magazines are a real value in reader 's lives , that readers are really involved . ''
The critics also lambasted the magazine industry for something executives often are very proud of : the growth in magazine titles during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Lauder</ENAMEX> , president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Estee Lauder</ENAMEX> , said consumer magazines are suffering from what he called `` niche-itis , '' the increasing number of magazines that target the idosyncratic interests of readers .
`` Niche-itis fragments our advertising dollars , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lauder</ENAMEX> .
`` We are being over - magazined .
We are constantly faced with deciding which partnerships -LCB- with magazines -RCB- we can keep . ''
He added : `` There 's probably even a magazine for left - handed golfers ... but the general interest magazine is something we all miss , and it should come back . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lauder</ENAMEX> also attacked what he sees as the wide imitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Elle</ENAMEX> , a fashion magazine published by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Diamandis Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> , and criticized the practice of stacking ads at the front of magazines .
`` Readers do n't want to face all those ad pages at the front of a magazine , '' he said .
Magazine editors did not take the criticisms lying down .
`` We spend a fortune on research information , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Burzon</ENAMEX> , publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Meredith Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Metropolitan Home</ENAMEX> .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX> , editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Conde Nast Publications Inc. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> , said advertisers are frequently asked to take advertising positions in the back of her magazine to relieve ad clutter .
`` But advertisers would n't think of it , '' she said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Leser</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Conde Nast</ENAMEX> , added : `` Our research shows we sell more of our heavier issues ... because readers believe they are getting more for what they pay for .
