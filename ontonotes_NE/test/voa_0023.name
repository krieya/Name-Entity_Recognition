This is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VOA News</ENAMEX> now .
A new and simple blood test may soon be available to help doctors tell which of their diabetic patients is most likely to develop crippling and life - threatening complications .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VOA</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Berman</ENAMEX> explains .
Researcher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Levi</ENAMEX> says scientists have long been puzzled by the question of which diabetics develop complications and why .
We know that the complications are directly related to a couple of things .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> is how long you 've had the diabetes , how well you 've been controlled , but it 's clear that people with the same level of control of their glucose , same duration of the diabetes differ dramatically in their susceptibility to these complications that are so devastating .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levi</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one third</ENAMEX> of insulin taking patients ends up with kidney failure and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</ENAMEX> develop blinding eye disease .
Scientists have suspected there must be something different about the genetic make - up of diabetics who develop complications ; and that difference may have to do with haptoglobin , a protein whose function is to mop up blood vessel destroying free radicals .
The free radicals are released when oxygen carrying red blood cells called haemoglobin die .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Levi</ENAMEX> says there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> different types of haptoglobin and he and his colleagues at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Technion Institute</ENAMEX> have found that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> type of haptoglobin called Type 1 - 1 appears protective against diabetic complications while the other <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> types do not .
Researchers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Technion Institute</ENAMEX> led by Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levi</ENAMEX> have developed a simple blood test to let doctors and patients know who is most likely to develop diabetic complications .
