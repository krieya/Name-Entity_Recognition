Per an invitation from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mozah</ENAMEX> ?
May God lead you to righteousness , my brother .
What you conveyed just jams the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mozah</ENAMEX> .
I mean , the one who wrote the news deliberately intended it .
He said to his wife : be silent .
And he said to his son : shut up .
Your voices distort my thinking .
Do not utter a word .
I want to write about freedom of expression !
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Shaheen2005</ENAMEX>
Intended it or not , do you expect that anything happens in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> today without the approval of Her Highness Sheikha <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mozah</ENAMEX> ?
Sheikha <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mozah</ENAMEX> seeks to please <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> by all means , even if all the citizens of the country disagree with her ... and the goal is known .
Accept the regards of your brother .

" In his judgment , if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> would go back to the borders of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> would make peace with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> , " <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX> told reporters after the meeting .
" He -LRB- Sheikh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamad</ENAMEX> -RRB- says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> was elected , and he thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> is more pragmatic than we think . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX> said about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> movement , which won the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> elections in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</ENAMEX> and refuses to recognize the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> state , " I told him that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> has refused to meet .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> has announced it will not recognize the signed agreements between us and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> " should , pay so much attention to their declarations , as they have to please another audience , " he reported Sheikh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamad</ENAMEX> as saying in the meeting , which lasted for <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one hour</ENAMEX> , and which he described as " frank and amiable .

" I do not think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> has a problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> ; it has a problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmadinejad</ENAMEX> , " <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX> said .

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iran</ENAMEX> 's neighbors in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Gulf</ENAMEX> expressed their concern over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> 's nuclear plans , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> officials said that an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> which owns nuclear weapons could spur a regional arms race .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX> was the most senior <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> official to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Doha</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> when he opened a trade office in the country .

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Esseri</ENAMEX> .
A crisis and what a crisis ...
In general , I believe they will look for any justification in order to attract the likes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX> in a way that facilitates his attendance and presence .
It is ok also if that lecture story is used , as long as it achieves the goal .
Sufficient unto us is God , and He is the best supporter .
