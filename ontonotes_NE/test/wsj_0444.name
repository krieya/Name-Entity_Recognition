Bargain hunters helped stock prices break a weeklong losing streak while bond prices and the dollar inched higher .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.76</ENAMEX> points to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2603.48</ENAMEX> in light trading after losing more than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</ENAMEX> points <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> .
Bond prices continued to edge higher in anticipation of more news showing a slower economy .
Although the dollar rose slightly against most major currencies , the focus in currency markets was on the beleaguered <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> pound , which gained slightly against the dollar .
Trading volume on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> dwindled to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 126.6 million</ENAMEX> shares <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> as major brokerage firms continued to throw in the towel on program trading .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> became the most recent firm to swear off stock - index arbitrage trading for its own account , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late yesterday</ENAMEX> took the major step of renouncing the trading strategy even for its clients .
Yet that did n't eliminate program trading from the market .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow</ENAMEX> industrials shot up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</ENAMEX> points in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the opening hour</ENAMEX> , at least in part because of buy programs generated by stock - index arbitrage , a form of program trading involving futures contracts .
But interest waned as <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> wore on and investors looked ahead to the release <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">later this week</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> important economic reports .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> 's survey of purchasing managers , considered a good indicator of how the nation 's manufacturing sector fared in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> .
The other is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's measure of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> employment , an indicator of the broader economy 's health .
Both are expected to show continued sluggishness , which would be good for bonds and bad for stocks .
In major market activity : Stock prices rose in light trading .
But declining issues on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> outnumbered gainers <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">774</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">684</ENAMEX> , and broader market indexes were virtually unchanged .
Bond prices crept higher .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond gained <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about an eighth</ENAMEX> of a point , or <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.25</ENAMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</ENAMEX> face amount .
The yield on the issue slipped to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.92 %</ENAMEX> .
The dollar gained .
In late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> trading the dollar was quoted at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8340 marks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.90 yen</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8300 marks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.65 yen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> pound , pressured by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week 's</ENAMEX> resignations of key <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> administration officials , nevertheless rose <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5820</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5795</ENAMEX> .
