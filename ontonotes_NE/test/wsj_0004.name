Yields on money - market mutual funds continued to slide , amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates .
The average <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven - day</ENAMEX> compound yield of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</ENAMEX> taxable funds tracked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Money Fund Report</ENAMEX> eased a fraction of a percentage point to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.45 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.47 %</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the week ended Tuesday</ENAMEX> .
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</ENAMEX> .
Average maturity of the funds ' investments lengthened by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">41 days</ENAMEX> , the longest since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early August</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Donoghue 's</ENAMEX> .
Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period .
Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner .
The average maturity for funds open only to institutions , considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely , reached a high point for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">33 days</ENAMEX> .
Nevertheless , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brenda Malizia Negus</ENAMEX> , editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Money Fund Report</ENAMEX> , yields `` may blip up again before they blip down '' because of recent rises in short - term interest rates .
The yield on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills sold at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> 's auction , for example , rose to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.04 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.90 %</ENAMEX> .
Despite recent declines in yields , investors continue to pour cash into money funds .
Assets of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</ENAMEX> taxable funds grew by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the latest week</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 352.7 billion</ENAMEX> .
Typically , money - fund yields beat comparable short - term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates .
The top money funds are currently yielding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">well over 9 %</ENAMEX> .
Dreyfus World - Wide Dollar , the top - yielding fund , had a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven - day</ENAMEX> compound yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.37 %</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the latest week</ENAMEX> , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.45 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week earlier</ENAMEX> .
It invests heavily in dollar - denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees , which boosts its yield .
The average <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven - day</ENAMEX> simple yield of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</ENAMEX> funds was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.12 %</ENAMEX> , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.14 %</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - day</ENAMEX> simple yield fell to an average <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.19 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.22 %</ENAMEX> ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - day</ENAMEX> compound yield slid to an average <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.53 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.56 %</ENAMEX> .
