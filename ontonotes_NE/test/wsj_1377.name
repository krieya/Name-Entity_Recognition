<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SMYRNA</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga.</ENAMEX> --
The auto - dealer strip in this booming suburb runs <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly five miles</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cobb Parkway</ENAMEX> , stretching from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Perimeter</ENAMEX> highway that circles <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the `` Big Chicken</ENAMEX> , '' a pullet - roofed fast - food restaurant and local landmark .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty years ago</ENAMEX> , in the infancy of suburban sprawl , just a handful of dealerships were here .
Now there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</ENAMEX> .
Alongside such long - familiar names as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dodge</ENAMEX> are nameplates that did n't exist until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Acura</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sterling</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hyundai</ENAMEX> .
Under construction is the strip 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">24th</ENAMEX> showroom , the future home of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> , a luxury marque launched by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">just two months ago</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">The 1980s</ENAMEX> have spawned an explosion of consumer choice in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , in everything from phone companies to colas .
And especially , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cobb Parkway</ENAMEX> strip attests , in cars .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">now</ENAMEX> can choose among <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">572</ENAMEX> different models of cars , vans and trucks , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 408</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</ENAMEX> began , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Automotive News</ENAMEX> , a trade publication .
For car marketers , it has become a much tougher battle to keep loyal customers from defecting to one of the new makes on the block .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> car buyers , the proliferation of choice is both liberating and confusing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm MacDougall</ENAMEX> , vice chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jordan , McGrath , Case -AMP- Taylor</ENAMEX> advertising agency in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , calls the proliferation `` nameplate mania . ''
He says the number of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , and that people will simply ignore new models that lack a well - defined image .
`` The winners , '' he predicts , `` will be brands from car makers that have traditionally been associated with quality and value . ''
He says it 's important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible while still retaining links to the parent company 's quality image .
He applauds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan Motor Co.</ENAMEX> for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models , rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines .
Some auto executives believe the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks .
`` There 's more noise out there , and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent P. Barabba</ENAMEX> , executive director of market research and planning at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Motors Corp</ENAMEX> .
`` But the reward is that there 's less need to make tradeoffs '' in choosing one 's wheels .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeanene Page</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Salt Lake City</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> , likes the broader selection .
She wants something big , and already has looked at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">New Yorker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lincoln</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town Car</ENAMEX> .
Now , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">55 - year - old</ENAMEX> car shopper is zeroing in on a full - sized van , figuring that it 's just the thing to haul <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</ENAMEX> grandchildren and pull a boat at the same time .
`` That seems to be what all my friends are using to take the grandkids to the lake , '' she says .
Market segmentation in cars is n't new , but it 's far more extensive than when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred P. Sloan Jr.</ENAMEX> conceived the idea <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years ago</ENAMEX> .
The legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> chairman declared that his company would make `` a car for every purse and purpose . ''
Now there are many cars for every purse and purpose .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Just four years ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> planners divided the combined car and truck market into <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> segments .
Today , they identify <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</ENAMEX> distinct segments for cars , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another 11</ENAMEX> for trucks and vans .
The number of makes has mushroomed because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> is the world 's biggest and richest market for automobiles ; virtually every auto maker wants to sell here .
For every brand like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renault</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fiat</ENAMEX> that has been squeezed out , others such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Isuzu</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daihatsu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> have come in .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> tries to counter the foreign invasion with new brands of its own .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> launched the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Geo</ENAMEX> marque <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> to sell cars made in partnership with foreign auto makers , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> 's long - awaited <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saturn</ENAMEX> cars will make their debut .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> created the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> nameplate in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> - made touring sedans in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
But slow sales forced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> to kill the brand just <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> .
When consumers have so many choices , brand loyalty is much harder to maintain .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Wall Street Journal 's</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American Way of Buying</ENAMEX> '' survey found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's car buyers tend to switch brands .
For the survey , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Peter D. Hart Research Associates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Roper Organization</ENAMEX> each asked <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> consumers about their buying habits .
Which cars do <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> favor most <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> ?
It 's hard to generalize , but age seems to be the best predictor .
Adults <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">under age 30</ENAMEX> like sports cars , luxury cars , convertibles and imports far more than their elders do .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> of every <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> buyers <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">under 30</ENAMEX> would prefer to buy a sports car , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 16 %</ENAMEX> of adults <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30</ENAMEX> and over , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> survey .
Young consumers prefer luxury cars by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</ENAMEX> margin -- even though older buyers , because of their incomes , are more likely to actually purchase a luxury car .
Perhaps most striking , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</ENAMEX> of households headed by people aged <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">18 to 44</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</ENAMEX> foreign car .
That 's true of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 14 %</ENAMEX> of households headed by someone <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">60 or older</ENAMEX> .
Generally , imports appeal most to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> who live in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> and are well - educated , affluent and , especially , young .
`` For many baby boomers , buying a domestic car is a totally foreign experience , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Cedergren</ENAMEX> , auto - market analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">J.D. Power -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Agoura Hills</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif</ENAMEX> .
Such preferences persist even though many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> believe differences between imported and domestic cars are diminishing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 58 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">now</ENAMEX> believe that foreign cars get better gas mileage than domestic models , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> survey found , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Some 46 %</ENAMEX> give foreign cars higher quality ratings , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> .
On the other hand , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 42 %</ENAMEX> say foreign cars are less comfortable than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> models , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> .
People in the automotive business disagree over how susceptible younger <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> are to brand switching .
`` Once buying habits are formed , they 're very hard to break , '' declares <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Mignanelli</ENAMEX> , executive vice president for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> sales operations .
But out on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cobb Parkway</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Negas</ENAMEX> sees it differently .
`` The competition is so intense that an owner 's loyalty to a dealership or a car is virtually nonexistent , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Negas</ENAMEX> , vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ed Voyles Oldsmobile</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> dealerships to locate on the strip .
Thus the very fickleness of baby boomers may make it possible to win them back , just as it was possible to lose them .
The battle for customer loyalty is evident along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cobb Parkway</ENAMEX> strip .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ed Voyles Olds</ENAMEX> recently established a special section in the service department for owners whose cars are <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">less than a year old</ENAMEX> , so they get quicker service .
Just down the street , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chris Volvo</ENAMEX> invites serious shoppers to test - drive a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Volvo</ENAMEX> to any other dealership along the strip , and compare the cars side - by - side .
Manufacturers , too , are stretching further to lure buyers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cadillac</ENAMEX> division , ignoring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> 's long - held maxim that safety does n't sell , is airing television commercials touting its cars ' safety features .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cadillac</ENAMEX> may be on to something .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Some 60 %</ENAMEX> of the survey respondents said they would buy anti-lock brakes even if they carry a medium or high price tag .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">More than 50 %</ENAMEX> felt the same way about air bags .
Both features appealed most to buyers <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">under 45</ENAMEX> .
In contrast , dashboard computers , power seats and turbo - charged engines had little appeal .
But even a little appeal has a lot of attraction <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pontiac</ENAMEX> division is offering a turbo - charged V - 6 engine on its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grand Prix</ENAMEX> model , even though it expects to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 4,000</ENAMEX> cars equipped with that option .
The reason : Items with narrow appeal can be important in a market as fragmented as <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> spent <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 190 billion</ENAMEX> on new cars and trucks <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 1 %</ENAMEX> of that market exceeded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Polaroid Co. 's</ENAMEX> sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.86 billion</ENAMEX> .
`` Even if it 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1 %</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barabba</ENAMEX> , `` would you throw away sales the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Polaroid</ENAMEX> ? ''
