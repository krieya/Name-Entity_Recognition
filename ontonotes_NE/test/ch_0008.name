A lot of people who come from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> different religio- , religions go there .
oh yeah .
yeah ,
okay .
yeah .
mhm %hm .
So it was wonderful
and %um
And then what was the , %um , reception like ?
Well we went out into the garden and sort of had an informal receiving line ,
and then everybody went up to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">North Park</ENAMEX> and changed clothes ,
and uh-huh . we played softball , and , %uh , volleyball , and four square , and had dancing and m- music and great food , and
Wow , that sounds like a lot of fun .
It was .
Wow .
It sounds like it was great
yeah everybody , a lot of people told us it was the best wedding they had ever been to ,
and that 's , I guess , the highest compliment you can get .
Wow .
So ,
and where , did you guys go on a honeymoon ?
We went on a honeymoon to this island off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> . oh god . In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Carribean</ENAMEX> .
But i- , the hardest part was getting there .
I mean , we had to take <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> planes to get there .
But the
We got this book from my mom about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Carribean</ENAMEX> .
And , %um . I 'd always wanted to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Carribean</ENAMEX> .
So we just decided okay , we 'll go .
We only went for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</ENAMEX> .
It was pretty short
but , %um . uh-huh . The place was totally laid back .
It was this old plantation house that , %um , had this <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty - four</ENAMEX> rooms .
And , and , they said in the book like you wo n't be able to tell the guests from the staff .
And mhm . %um , it , it was really , really cool .
And they have , you know , i- , mismatched sheets and stuff .
It was n't fancy at all ,
but it was really cheap .
And uh-huh They just had the bar open all the time .
You could go and get whatever you wanted and just write it on your guest ticket .
And oh my god . They picked fresh mangoes from the yard for breakfast , and stuff .
It was great .
Wow , it sounds idyllic .
It was really tiny ,
so ,
the island is only <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ten miles</ENAMEX> long .
uh-huh .
%um . But it was , it was good cause i- , you know , everybody speaks <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> ,
and , and yet it 's still pretty exotic , you know .
uh-huh .
We went snorkeling .
And , it wa-
God , it sounds great .
That 's something I really regret is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norm</ENAMEX> and I did n't have a honeymoon .
yeah ,
well you should go on one anyway
yes .
yeah ,
we were planning on going one , on one one of these days ,
but I do n't know now what 's going to happen .
Well , you 'll just have to take your kid .
I know
I think it would be really funny if we go right now and tell people we 're going on our honeymoon .
How big are you ?
%um , well actually I 've only gained <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four pounds</ENAMEX> . uh-huh . But is it showing ? Which is not a lot for , you know , for how far I am ,
but I 'm , I 'm definitely pregnant .
yeah
I mean I have all of the .
You know I need to give myself the extra support when I get up .
And uh-huh . You know , like , you know how when you 're You know like when I get up , like , you know like how wide you put your feet apart when you get up ?
uh-huh .
Well I have to probably put my feet like <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five inches</ENAMEX> further apart and kind of hoist myself up sort of like .
uh-huh .
So .
Which is pretty funny
yeah ,
I 'm definitely pregnant .
But I 'm not huge by any means .
But i- , y- , what are you <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five and a half months</ENAMEX> now ?
yeah .
So , it 's it 's just starting to get into the part where you start to show . And uh-huh . start to get big and the whole bit .
But it 's weird .
Like , you go like , %um , like I 'm , I 'm not fatter in anywhere . uh-huh . Except my stomach .
I mean it honestly looks like I swallowed
I mean it 's really weird .
Like I can see You can s- .
I 've never really like been up close to a pregnant woman before
but you know , like I 've seen them at the gym and stuff like that , but never had a good friend that lived close by that was pregnant that I could like actually look at her .
uh-huh .
But you can see the line of your uterus .
You can see in your stomach where it is .
It 's like this big circle
and it sticks out in that big circle .
And it 's filling up with a -- yeah . -- thing . An alien presence .
That 's totally what it feels like .
Really .
Does it move around yet ?
oh yeah .
He , he , he kicks a lot .
I do n't , I do n't know that it 's a he ,
but I call him he .
He kicks a lot .
He 's been kicking for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about five weeks</ENAMEX> now .
%huh .
But , %um , he just started <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> .
He started rolling that I can feel .
I mean they roll the whole time ,
but now I can feel him rolling ,
and it 's totally bizarre .
It 's
Do you have a name for it , I mean like a , you know a joke name that you call it ?
Like
No .
I 've heard some really good ones .
But The only one that I came up with was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thumper</ENAMEX> , cause he just kicks so much .
He 's really an active baby .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thumper</ENAMEX> .
Well that 's good .
yeah .
Healthy .
Well , also the monster child is the other thing I call him .
The monster child .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosemary</ENAMEX> 's baby .
I know .
Well , %um . Because he kicks so much , it 's really , you know , it 's really annoying .
I mean
Does it wake you up ?
No he has n't woken me up yet ,
but if I wake up in the middle of the night , he is , he does kick
and so you can feel him kicking in the middle of the night if you wake up .
What if it 's a girl ?
Well , it 's probably not a girl , because in our family , it 's o- , if you go on both sides of our family , and you look at all our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> cousins , and everything , it 's like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">seventy five percent</ENAMEX> male .
%huh .
But it might be a girl .
I was positive it was a girl .
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first three months</ENAMEX> , I was absolutely positive it was a girl .
And then I changed my mind an-
now she is a boy .
Well that 'll be a surprise then .
yeah ,
yeah .
I do n't know .
Are you going to ask them not to tell you if you had
oh we 're not having an ultrasound .
uh-huh .
Because it 's really like ,
We went and looked up all this research .
There 's all this stuff .
You 'll see when you get pregnant .
And , If , if you want to know , just send me email . Because I looked up a bunch of stuff ,
but , there 's all this research like on , there 's all different kinds of prenatal tests that you can get now .
It 's not just amnio ,
it 's like other stuff too .
uh-huh .
And then there 's also , %um , you know , the , the , %uh , the ultrasound .
But in fact , like if you look at the l , the la- , the latest research on ultrasound , it 's like , they really do n't know .
Like they assume that it 's safe , because , you know , they 've had it for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</ENAMEX> , right .
And nothing has happened ?
They never
Ye- ,
well they do n't know .
They 've never really done any big studies on it or anything .
But the but if you 're a normal , low ,
like there 's reasons to have an ultrasound .
And if you have to have an ultrasound , then it 's a really good diagnostic tool , right ?
Right .
But in a normal low risk pregnancy like mine it 's not a good diagnostic tool at all .
Like , is they find as many , %um , false positives as they do false negatives .
For , for spina bifida and stuff ?
Well the only thing they can really check , they can check the heart .
uh-huh .
And then they can check to see if the baby has a brain .
And then they can do like yeah . But then they can do some measurements to see if the baby has , %um , %ah
Defects of various kinds .
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Down</ENAMEX> 's Syndrome .
Like sometimes y- .
But that 's not really very good .
Like amnio is the only sure way to find out .
Right .
But it could give you like some indications that the baby might have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Down</ENAMEX> 's or something .
But it 's really not a very good diagnostic tool at all for people with low risk pregnancies .
So , yeah . I did n't bother getting one .
yeah ,
good .
I 'm sure everything will be fine .
oh yeah .
And if it 's not , it 's like , you know , you 're going to have to deal with it anyway .
Well what are you going to do I mean , if it 's not , like
and we did n't do any of the testing because , like , I , I 've met like <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> people since I got pregnant , where the baby had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Down</ENAMEX> 's , right .
They found out the baby had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Down</ENAMEX> 's .
And they aborted it .
They had ,
well , it 's not called abortion , it 's called termina-
Termination ,
that 's right .
And I jus- , I just could n't have done that .
I just .
We talked about it a little bit ,
you know what I mean .
Like obviously I do n't want my baby to have a mental defect or anything like that .
But
But if it does , you 'll deal with it .
I just could not have done that .
So it was n't worth doing the prenatal testing . Because , you know
If you 're not going to abort anyway , then there 's no reason to have it .
yeah .
I mean there are like some , there are some conditions that they can test for that are sort of incompatible with life .
Right .
But then I figured , well , I 'll just go through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the nine months</ENAMEX> of pregnancy and then the baby will die when it 's born . You know .
If it 's like that .
yeah .
yeah ,
we had this friend .
This is not supposed to scare you ,
it 's just because it was on the topic .
But , %um , but , the baby died at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">like eight and a half months</ENAMEX> .
%mm .
I know .
I read so many of those stories .
They just freak me out .
You know .
And of course they make you have , give birth anyway .
You know you ca n't have an
You have to .
I mean what are .
I mean that 's how you have an abortion is you give birth you kn-
yeah .
And it 's dead
you know it 's dead .
And it 's a hassle , you know .
And you 've got to go through all that pain knowing the baby 's not even alive anyway .
yeah .
But , you know . She 's a pregnant again .
You know , sh- , they 're fine .
And what happened to the baby ?
Do they know ?
They got over it .
I think it got either strangled by its cord or some kind of
yeah
that 's what they g- .
They always say that g-
They say that
but
cord accident .
It 's an it was an accident .
It 's like they do n't know .
yeah ,
you know . It 's like something happened .
Or , or maybe it it went into oxygen deficiency or something .
Like something happened to her
and she was asleep at the time ,
yeah .
mhm .
and so she did n't even know it until <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</ENAMEX> .
And
It was something like that .
Wow .
That is so scary .
But obviously , you know , y- , when you have a baby for the rest of its life and your life , you have to worry that it might die , you know , or something will happen to it .
oh I know it is so scary .
It 's awful .
That 's got to be the worst thing .
Well anyhow , did you get to meet your nephew at your , %uh I did . The baby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> is huge . at the wedding .
He 's , he 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</ENAMEX>
and he 's like <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eighteen pounds</ENAMEX> .
oh my god .
The kid is ado- .
But it 's all breast milk .
That 's huge .
That 's like the size of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two year old</ENAMEX> is n't it ?
He 's huge .
He 's , he 's the shape of a , of a small ch- baby
but you know , he 's big .
He 's heavy .
oh , you better hope that that does n't run in the family .
How big was he when he was born .
Well . He was normal size when he was born .
<ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Like eight and a half pounds .</ENAMEX>
ok- . okay .
yeah .
But , %um , my brothe- , you know , my uncle is <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">like six foot four</ENAMEX> ,
and my brother is big ,
and , on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaelin</ENAMEX> 's side of the family there 's big people too .
So , I mean , he could just be a big boy
That 's
I mean <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eighteen pounds</ENAMEX> .
That is humongous .
<ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Eighteen pounds</ENAMEX> from breast milk alone in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</ENAMEX> .
oh my god .
And yet he 's small . You know ,
he does n't l- look that huge .
He 's not very long or anything
he 's just .
uh-huh .
And he 's not chub- He 's chubby
but he 's He just weighs .
He 's hefty .
yup
yeah
well they do n't you know they just tell you feed on demand .
I mean if they want to eat that much you let them eat that much .
and and he 's healthy and all
so you know she 's just like oh well
uh-huh
uh-huh
And do they seem happy and ?
