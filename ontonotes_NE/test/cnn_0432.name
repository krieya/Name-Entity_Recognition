Who is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aaron Tonkin</ENAMEX> .
He is one of the biggest if not the biggest names in the world of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> fund - raisers .
A person who would put together celebrities with charities to raise a lot of money .
He was perhaps best known as kind of the focal point between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> community .

Right now , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aaron Tonkin</ENAMEX> factors in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no fewer than seven</ENAMEX> different federal and state investigations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of them being an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> investigation into <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">several million dollars</ENAMEX> worth of cash and gift that is he gave to many many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> celebrities .
Now , his attorney gave us a statement I 'll put it on the screen .
