The dollar posted gains against all major currencies <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , buoyed by persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> bond issues .
While market sentiment remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based on sluggish <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economic indicators , dealers note that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> demand has helped underpin the dollar against the yen and has kept the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency from plunging below key levels against the mark .
At the same time , dealers said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> unit has been locked into a relatively narrow range in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</ENAMEX> , in part because the hefty <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> demand for dollars has been offset by the mark 's strength , resulting in a stalemate .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Goldinger</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capital Insight Inc.</ENAMEX> , reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well -- the mark climbed to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">77.70 yen</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">77.56 yen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Tuesday</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> -- the strength of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> bond market compared to its foreign counterparts has helped lure investors to dollar - denominated bonds , rather than mark bonds .
`` Dollar - yen -LCB- trade -RCB- is the driving force in the market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Trettien</ENAMEX> , a vice president with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Banque Paribas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , `` but I 'm not convinced it will continue .
Who knows what will happen down the road , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three to six months</ENAMEX> , if foreign investment starts to erode ? ''
In late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> trading <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , the dollar was quoted at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8500 marks</ENAMEX> , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8415 marks</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Tuesday</ENAMEX> , and at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">143.80 yen</ENAMEX> , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.85 yen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Tuesday</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">Sterling</ENAMEX> was quoted at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5755</ENAMEX> , down from $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5805</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Tuesday</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency opened for trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">143.93 yen</ENAMEX> , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">143.08 yen</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Madison</ENAMEX> , a corporate trader with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bank of America</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , traced the dollar 's recent solid performance against the yen to purchases of securities by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> insurance companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings .
He contends that the perception in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> of a vitriolic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony Corp. 's</ENAMEX> announcement of its purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> has been temporarily mollified .
He cites the recent deal between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Mitsubishi Estate Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Rockefeller Group</ENAMEX> , as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> company in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Georgia - Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> takeover bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.</ENAMEX> as evidence .
The forthcoming maturity in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> government yen - denominated bond issue valued at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 16 billion</ENAMEX> has prompted speculation in the market that investors redeeming the bonds will diversify into dollar - denominated instruments , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madison</ENAMEX> .
It remains unclear whether the bond issue will be rolled over .
Meanwhile , traders in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> say that the prospect of lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> interest rates has spurred dollar buying by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> institutions .
They point out that these institutions want to lock in returns on high - yield <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX> debt and suggest demand for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> unit will continue unabated until rates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> recede .
The market again showed little interest in further evidence of a slowing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy , and traders note that the market in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</ENAMEX> has taken its cues more from Wall Street than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economic indicators .
Dealers said the dollar merely drifted lower following the release <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> purchasing managers ' report .
The managers ' index , which measures the health of the manufacturing sector , stood at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47.6 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> , above <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46 %</ENAMEX> , and also above average forecasts for the index of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45.3 %</ENAMEX> .
Some dealers said the dollar was pressured slightly because a number of market participants had boosted their expectations in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past day</ENAMEX> and were looking for an index above <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> , which indicates an expanding manufacturing economy .
But most said the index had no more than a minimal effect on trade .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , gold for current delivery settled at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">374.20</ENAMEX> an ounce , down <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</ENAMEX> .
Estimated volume was <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a moderate 3.5 million ounces</ENAMEX> .
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> , gold was quoted at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">374.19</ENAMEX> an ounce .
