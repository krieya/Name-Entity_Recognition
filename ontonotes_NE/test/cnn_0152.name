Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 20 years</ENAMEX> , the display has gotten bigger and brighter , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doof</ENAMEX> says this one is the biggest yet .
He spends long hours on his elaborate display .

He pays careful attention to all the fine details .
Every year , he hand - paints <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30,000</ENAMEX> of the tiny globes that decorate his home .
