The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> is required to notify foreign dictators if it knows of coup plans likely to endanger their lives , government officials said .
The notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> exchange of letters between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> .
The existence of the guidelines has become known since President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> disclosed them privately to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> senators at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> meeting last <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
Officials familiar with the meeting said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">month</ENAMEX> 's futile effort to oust <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Panamanian</ENAMEX> dictator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX> .
According to the officials , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> discussing the guidelines .
They said the president conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">month</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> coup effort .
No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , but merely sought to imprison him .
What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> .
The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and intelligence committee leaders <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 12</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</ENAMEX> before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules .
However , the disclosure of the guidelines , first reported <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC News</ENAMEX> , is already being interpreted on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> as an unfair effort to pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> .
It has reopened the bitter wrangling between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad .
A statement issued by the office of the committee chairman , Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Okla.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> .
The statement added , `` Someone has regrettably chosen to selectively summarize portions of highly classified correspondence between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> branches of government .
Not only does this come close to a violation of law , it violates the trust we have all worked to develop . ''
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> said , `` It 's time to stop bickering and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the country in the future .
I 've invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> , the panel 's vice chairman , said of the disclosure that `` a text torn out of context is a pretext , and it is unfair for those in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion . ''
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> said the committee could n't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate classification rules .
But the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline was n't imposed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> by a meddling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> .
Instead , both congressional and administration officials agreed , it grew out of talks about coup - planning in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> that were initiated by the administration in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1988</ENAMEX> and stretched into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last October</ENAMEX> .
The guideline was n't a law , but a joint interpretation of how the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> role in assassinations .
In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> the administration and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> were still differing on what had been agreed to .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> administration official said notification was required even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> `` gets wind '' of somebody else 's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator 's life .
But a congressional source close to the panel said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
Although the notification guideline was n't carried out in this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">month</ENAMEX> 's coup attempt , some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence and military operatives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> senior administration official called the guideline `` outrageous '' and said it could make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble .
The issue came to a head <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , officials recalled , partly because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> coup efforts .
In addition , both administration and congressional officials said the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign .
Though the assassination ban is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> order that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> never voted on , the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Webster</ENAMEX> publicly called on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> more freedom to act in coups .
The administration has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> for restrictions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> said have hampered its freedom of action .
However , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> 's two top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> deputies said congressional curbs had n't hampered the spy agency 's role in the coup attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> .
Nevertheless , the administration 's criticisms appeared to have made some headway with Sens. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> after their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 12</ENAMEX> meeting with the president .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> men agreed to rewrite the guidelines , without changing the basic assassination ban , to clear up any ambiguities that may have hampered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> encouragement of coups against <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="5">anti-American</ENAMEX> leaders .
The new argument over the notification guideline , however , could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed .
