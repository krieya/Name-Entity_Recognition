Should you really own stocks ?
That 's a question a lot of people are asking , following the stock market 's stunning display of volatility .
Whipsawed financially and emotionally by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's heartstopping <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</ENAMEX> - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</ENAMEX> - point rebound , they 're wondering if an individual has any business being in the market .
The answer , say academic researchers , money managers and investment specialists , is yes -- as long as you approach the stock market as an investor .
But , they say , people should n't try to be traders , who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock .
The case for owning stocks over the long - term is compelling .
`` If you look at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">75 years</ENAMEX> worth of investment history -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Great Depression</ENAMEX> and every bear market since -- stocks have outperformed almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Berlin</ENAMEX> , vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Wachovia Capital Management</ENAMEX> .
A dollar invested in the stock market in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</ENAMEX> would have grown to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">473.29</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of last June</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Siegel</ENAMEX> , managing director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ibbotson Associates Inc</ENAMEX> .
But a dollar invested in long - term bonds in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</ENAMEX> would have grown to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 16.56</ENAMEX> , and a dollar put in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills would equal <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a meager $ 9.29</ENAMEX> .
The longer the time period , the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market .
Over time , the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio .
For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Gregory</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> money manager , calculates that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Standard -AMP- Poor 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> - stock index , the chance of losing money is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 % to 4 %</ENAMEX> over a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> period , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</ENAMEX> .
`` If you do n't need the money for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</ENAMEX> , there 's a clear - cut case for sticking to a steady core of stocks , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory</ENAMEX> says .
Stock - market investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Blankenship Jr.</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Institute of Certified Financial Planners</ENAMEX> .
Stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate , bonds , international securities and cash , he says .
There are some important caveats : Before investing in stocks , individuals should have <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at least three to six months</ENAMEX> of living expenses set aside in the bank , most investment advisers say .
Individuals also should focus on building equity in a home , which provides some protection against inflation , as well as a nest - egg that can be cashed in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living .
People also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future -- for example , for college tuition payments or retirement expenses .
`` You may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blankenship</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Del Mar</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> financial planner .
But once the basics are covered , `` then I would start to invest , even if it 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little as $ 1,000</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Lipper</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lipper Analytical Services Inc</ENAMEX> .
He says individuals should consider not just stocks , but other long - term investments , such as high - quality bonds .
Despite the strong case for stocks , however , most pros warn that individuals should n't try to profit from short - term developments .
`` It 's very difficult to do , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Holt</ENAMEX> , a market strategist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wedbush Morgan Securities</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> brokerage firm .
`` Our markets move so fast and they are so volatile , there 's no way the average investor can compete with the pros . ''
Individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market .
The cost of executing stock orders varies from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</ENAMEX> of the order 's value is an average , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Boesel</ENAMEX> , manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">T. Rowe Price 's</ENAMEX> Growth and Income mutual fund .
And assuming their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> investment is successful , investors will have to pay taxes on their gains .
That can reduce returns by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> or more , once local taxes are included , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipper</ENAMEX> says .
After that , individual traders face the risk that the new investment they choose wo n't perform well -- so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing .
`` It 's very tough for most individuals to out - trade the mutual funds or the market , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipper</ENAMEX> .
`` You should really think twice if you think you can out - smart the system . ''
Then , too , many individual investors lack the sturdy emotional makeup professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market .
So what 's the best way to buy stocks ?
`` Unless an individual has a minimum of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000</ENAMEX> to invest in stocks , he 's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks , in terms of getting enough attention from a competent broker , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipper</ENAMEX> .
Still , he adds , `` I could see owning both , given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in spotting special situations based on their own insights , '' he adds .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Douglas</ENAMEX> , first vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> , says that individuals have a particular edge now in `` small to medium - size niche companies with exciting earnings prospects '' -- a traditional stomping ground for small investors .
This growth sector , which usually carries a price / earnings multiple about twice that of the Standard -AMP- Poor 's 500 , happens to include some of the market 's most attractive bargains right now .
`` It 's now selling at a multiple about even with the market , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> .
Moreover , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term .
Many big Wall Street brokerage firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</ENAMEX> are now resuming coverage of this area , he notes .
`` We 're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks , '' he says .
The pros strenuously advise individuals to stay away from the latest investment fad .
They say that 's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle , when there 's no robust bull market to bail investors out of their mistakes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's correction presents `` a pretty good buying opportunity , but let 's not speculate at this point in the business cycle , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carmine Grigoli</ENAMEX> , chief equity portfolio strategist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Boston Corp</ENAMEX> .
`` Buy stocks on weakness for their long - term fundamentals , '' he says .
In the long run , investment advisers say , most investors will be better off using the dollar - cost averaging method of buying stocks .
In this method , a person invests a regular amount every <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">month</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</ENAMEX> into the stock market whether the market is up or down .
That cuts the risk , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> money manager , points out .
`` When the market is low , you are buying more shares , and when it 's high , you 're buying fewer shares , '' he says .
Otherwise , if you put all your money in at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> time , by sheer bad luck , you might pick a terrible time , and have to wait <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> to get even , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory</ENAMEX> says .
A disciplined program will work the best , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesel</ENAMEX> says .
`` One of the hardest things to do is to buy stocks when the market is down , '' he says .
`` But that 's just the time when you should be buying them . ''
