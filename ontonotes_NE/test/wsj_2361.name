On a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> , in the midst of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany 's</ENAMEX> most popular prime - time show , a contestant bet the host that she could name any of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> different cheeses after just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> nibble , while blindfolded .
The woman won the bet .
But perhaps even more remarkable , the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">three - hour</ENAMEX> - show , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wetten Dass</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Make a Bet</ENAMEX> -RRB- , regularly wins the top slot in the country 's TV ratings , sometimes drawing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as many as 50 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> households .
As the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> economic integration approaches , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> 's cultural curators have taken to the ramparts against <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> `` cultural imperialism , '' threatening to impose quotas against such pop invaders as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dallas</ENAMEX> , '' `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Miami Vice</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">L.A. Law</ENAMEX> . ''
But much of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Europeans</ENAMEX> want to protect seems every bit as cheesy as what they are trying to keep out .
The most militant opposition to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> TV imports has come from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> television and movie producers , who have demanded quotas ensuring that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a full 60 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> 's TV shows be produced in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> .
So far , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> have failed to win enough broad - based support to prevail .
A glance through the television listings and a few twists of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> television dial suggest <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> reason why .
While there are some popular action and drama series , few boast the high culture and classy production values one might expect .
More <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> air time is filled with low - budget game shows , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">variety hours</ENAMEX> , movies and talk shows , many of which are authorized knock - offs of their <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> counterparts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> 's most popular <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> programs features semi-celebrities seeking out their grammar - school classmates for on - air reunions .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Flemish</ENAMEX> game show has as its host a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Belgian</ENAMEX> pretending to be <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Italian</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> 's favorite shows , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fantastico</ENAMEX> , '' a tepid variety show , is so popular that viewers clamored to buy a chocolate product , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cacao Fantastico</ENAMEX> , '' whose praises were sung <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each week</ENAMEX> by dancing showgirls -- even though the product did n't exist .
Topping the cheese stunt , on <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">another typical evening</ENAMEX> of fun on `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wetten Dass</ENAMEX> , '' a contestant won a bet with the show 's host , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Gottschalk</ENAMEX> , that he could identify <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> dialects over the telephone .
A celebrity guest , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> Ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Burt</ENAMEX> , also won a bet that someone could pile up $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">150</ENAMEX> worth of quarters on a slanted coin .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burt</ENAMEX> nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost , agreeing to spend <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans - Dietrich Genscher</ENAMEX> frying and selling their combined weight in potato pancakes .
If this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the protectionist barriers , it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> programs usually target only their own local audience , and often only a small portion of that .
Mega-hits in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> rarely make it even to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Britain</ENAMEX> , and almost never show up on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> screens .
Attempts to produce `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="4">pan-European</ENAMEX> '' programs have generally resulted in disappointment .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> co-production , the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">three - hour</ENAMEX> - long `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eurovision Song Contest</ENAMEX> , '' featuring soft - rock songs from each of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> countries , has been described as the world 's most boring TV show .
Another , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jeux Sans Frontieres</ENAMEX> , '' where villagers from assorted <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> countries make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks , is a hit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - made imitation under the title `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Almost Anything Goes</ENAMEX> '' flopped fast .
For the most part , what 's made here stays here , and for good reason .
The cream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> crop , the literary dramas that are shown on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> public television as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Masterpiece Theater</ENAMEX> , '' make up a relatively small part of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> air time .
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> programming is more of an acquired taste .
There is , for instance , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">One Man and His Dog</ENAMEX> , '' a herding contest among sheep dogs .
Also riveting to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</ENAMEX> of dart - throwing championships , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">even more hours</ENAMEX> of lawn bowling contests and <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">still more hours</ENAMEX> of snooker marathons .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> drama has had better , though still mixed , fortunes .
The most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> knock - off of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dallas</ENAMEX> , '' called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chateauvallon</ENAMEX> '' and set in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> vineyard , had a good run in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> , which ended after the female lead was injured in a real - life auto accident .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Schwarzwaldklinik</ENAMEX> , '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Black Forest Clinic</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">St . Elsewhere</ENAMEX> '' set in a health spa , is popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> , and has spread into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> 's most popular series is a drama called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Piovra</ENAMEX> , '' or `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Octopus</ENAMEX> , '' which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young investigator in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palermo</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mafia</ENAMEX> .
It was front - page news in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> when the fictional inspector was gunned down in the series .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> 's most popular mini-series <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> was `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Juncal</ENAMEX> , '' the story of an aging bullfighter .
`` The trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular , with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> programs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Wenham</ENAMEX> , a former director of programs for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the British Broadcasting Corp</ENAMEX> .
`` Given a choice , everybody will watch a home - produced show . ''
But frequently there is n't much choice .
Thus , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own , programs with broader appeal .
`` We 've basically got to start from scratch , to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see , '' concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colin Young</ENAMEX> , head of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Film Theatre School</ENAMEX> .
While some in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> contend that advertising is the bane of television , here many believe that its absence is to blame for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> TV industry 's sluggish development .
Until recently , national governments in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising .
Since production costs were guaranteed , it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into syndication , as most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> programs are .
But not much money was spent on the shows , either , a situation that encouraged cheap - to - make talk and game shows , while discouraging expensive - to - produce dramas .
Now , however , commercial channels are coming to most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Just last week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> authorized <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> commercial channels for the first time ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels .
The result is a new and huge appetite for programming .
But perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas , most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available -- reruns -- usually of shows made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sky Channel</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> - based venture of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Australian - American</ENAMEX> press tycoon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX> , offers what must be a baffling cultural mix to most of its audience .
The financially struggling station offers programs obviously made available cheaply from its boss 's other ventures .
In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> hotel room recently , a viewer caught the end of a badly acted series about a fishing boat on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Great Barrier Reef</ENAMEX> , only to be urged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> announcer to `` stay tuned for the further adventures of Skippy the Kangaroo .
