As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> pointed out , the next battleground is a bill to block lawsuits by victims of gun violence or families against gunmakers and dealers , and one person whose suit would be blocked is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denise Johnson</ENAMEX> if the legislation goes through , the widow of bus driver <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conrad Johnson</ENAMEX> , the last person killed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> sniper attacks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Lowe</ENAMEX> is an attorney with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence</ENAMEX> who filed the suit on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> and other victims ' families .
Good of you to join us .
Let 's talk about what Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> wrote in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the `` Washington Post ''</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
We 'll put a small part of that up on the screen right now where she said , `` I am confident that the criminal justice system will work to punish the people who killed my husband , but the civil justice system must also be allowed to work , those who share responsibility for my husband 's death must also be held accountable . ''
What does she mean ?
