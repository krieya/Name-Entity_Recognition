<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.J. Park</ENAMEX> and her family scrimped for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> to buy a tiny apartment here , but found that the closer they got to saving the $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">40,000</ENAMEX> they originally needed , the more the price rose .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</ENAMEX> , it had more than doubled .
Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">33 - year - old</ENAMEX> housewife , whose husband earns a modest salary as an assistant professor of economics , is saving harder than ever .
`` I am determined to get an apartment in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> , '' she says .
`` It 's all I think about or talk about . ''
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</ENAMEX> of other young <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Koreans</ENAMEX> , the long - cherished dream of home ownership has become a cruel illusion .
For the government , it has become a highly volatile political issue .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last May</ENAMEX> , a government panel released a report on the extent and causes of the problem .
During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 15 years</ENAMEX> , the report showed , housing prices increased nearly fivefold .
The report laid the blame on speculators , who it said had pushed land prices up ninefold .
The panel found that since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , real - estate prices rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 50 %</ENAMEX> in a speculative fever fueled by economic prosperity , <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the 1988 Seoul Olympics</ENAMEX> and the government 's pledge to rapidly develop <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> 's southwest .
The result is that those rich enough to own any real estate at all have boosted their holdings substantially .
For those with no holdings , the prospects of buying a home are ever slimmer .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quarter</ENAMEX> of the population owned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91 %</ENAMEX> of the nation 's <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">71,895 square kilometers</ENAMEX> of private land , the report said , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> of the population owned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</ENAMEX> of the land devoted to housing .
Meanwhile , the government 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Land Bureau</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about a third</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Korean</ENAMEX> families own their own homes .
Rents have soared along with house prices .
Former National Assemblyman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hong Sa - Duk</ENAMEX> , now a radio commentator , says the problem is intolerable for many people .
`` I 'm afraid of a popular revolt if this situation is n't corrected , '' he adds .
In fact , during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three months</ENAMEX> there have been several demonstrations at the office complex where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Land Bureau</ENAMEX> is housed , and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> , demanding the government put a stop to real - estate speculation .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh Tae Woo</ENAMEX> 's administration has been studying the real - estate crisis for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</ENAMEX> with an eye to partial land redistribution .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> , the government took <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> bills to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> .
The proposed legislation is aimed at rectifying some of the inequities in the current land - ownership system .
Highlights of the bills , as currently framed , are : -- A restriction on the amount of real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> family can own , to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">660 square meters</ENAMEX> in the nation 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> largest cities , but more in smaller cities and rural areas .
The government will penalize offenders , but wo n't confiscate property .
-- A tax of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 3 % and 6 %</ENAMEX> on property holdings that exceed the governmentset ceiling .
-- Taxes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 15 % and 50 %</ENAMEX> a year on `` excessive '' profits from the resale of property , or the sale of idle land to the government .
The government defines excessive profits as those above the average realized for other similar - sized properties in an area .
-- Grace periods ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two to five years</ENAMEX> before the full scope of the penalties takes effect .
The administration says the measures would stem rampant property speculation , free more land for the government 's ambitious housing - construction program , designed to build <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two million</ENAMEX> apartments by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> -- and , perhaps , boost the popular standing of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh</ENAMEX> .
But opposition legislators and others calling for help for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea 's</ENAMEX> renters say the proposed changes do n't go far enough to make it possible for ordinary people to buy a home .
Some want lower limits on house sizes ; others insist on progressively higher taxation for larger homes and lots .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice</ENAMEX> , a public - interest group leading the charge for radical reform , wants restrictions on landholdings , high taxation of capital gains , and drastic revamping of the value - assessment system on which property taxes are based .
But others , large landowners , real - estate developers and business leaders , say the government 's proposals are intolerable .
Led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federation of Korean Industries</ENAMEX> , the critics are lobbying for the government to weaken its proposed restrictions and penalties .
Government officials who are urging real - estate reforms balk at the arguments of business leaders and chafe at their pressure .
`` There is no violation of the capitalistic principle of private property in what we are doing , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Kyu Hwang</ENAMEX> , director of the government 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Land Bureau</ENAMEX> , which drafted the bills .
But , he adds , the constitution empowers the government to impose some controls , to mitigate the shortage of land .
The land available for housing construction stands at <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 46.2 square meters</ENAMEX> a person -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 %</ENAMEX> lower than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about half</ENAMEX> that of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> estimates that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10,000</ENAMEX> property speculators are operating in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> .
The chief culprits , he says , are big companies and business groups that buy huge amounts of land `` not for their corporate use , but for resale at huge profit . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> research institute calculated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 67 %</ENAMEX> of corporate - owned land is held by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">403</ENAMEX> companies -- and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as little as 1.5 %</ENAMEX> of that is used for business .
The government 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Office of Bank Supervision and Examination</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</ENAMEX> that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half of 1989</ENAMEX> , the nation 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> largest business groups bought real estate valued at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Ministry of Finance</ENAMEX> , as a result , has proposed a series of measures that would restrict business investment in real estate even more tightly than restrictions aimed at individuals .
Under those measures , financial institutions would be restricted from owning any more real estate than they need for their business operations .
Banks , investment and credit firms would be permitted to own land equivalent in value to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> of their capital -- currently the proportion is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</ENAMEX> .
The maximum allowable property holdings for insurance companies would be reduced to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> of their total asset value , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</ENAMEX> currently .
But Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Park</ENAMEX> acknowledges that even if the policies work to slow or stop speculation , apartment prices are unlikely to go down .
At best , she realizes , they will rise more slowly -- more slowly , she hopes , than her family 's income .
