Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Kuan Yew</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> 's leader and one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> 's leading statesmen for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</ENAMEX> , recently announced his intention to retire <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> -- though not necessarily to end his influence .
The prime minister , whose hair is thinning and gray and whose face has a perpetual pallor , nonetheless continues to display an energy , a precision of thought and a willingness to say publicly what most other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> leaders dare say only privately .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">66 - year - old</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> recently spent <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</ENAMEX> discussing the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> and the world with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> reporters in his plainly furnished , wood - paneled office .
The interview did not touch on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> 's domestic affairs .
Skipping personal pleasantries , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> picked up exactly where he left off <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several months earlier</ENAMEX> -- before the government crackdown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> -- when he had warned that the orthodox leadership in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> feared a plurality of views .
Excerpts follow :
On <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's turmoil : `` It is a very unhappy scene , '' he said .
`` It took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao Ziyang</ENAMEX> -LRB- former premier and party chief -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</ENAMEX> to build a team of economists who understood how the Western economies work and now that team is part in exile , part being rusticated and part missing . ''
Rebuilding that team , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> predicted , will take <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">another 10 years</ENAMEX> .
`` That 's very sad for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> could have been a good engine for growth , not just for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> but for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> and the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> . ''
On similarities between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> : `` In important particulars , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> are different from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> .
They are already industrialized ... .
Their problem is one of inefficiency of an industrial economy .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> problem is much greater -- it 's how to industrialize to begin with . ''
Asked if the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> , like <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> officials , wo n't <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</ENAMEX> face a similar conflict between the desire to liberalize economically and yet retain political control , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> said , `` I would think that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> face a deeper dilemma because they have been more in blinkers than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> -- I mean keeping their people cut off from the outside world . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> , he said , is ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's leaders in his awareness of the world .
`` But I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> peoples are more introverted than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> . ''
Regardless , he said , he still believes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , while falling far short of the efficiency of a Western economy , may well manage to improve considerably .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> - Pacific prosperity : `` If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> can keep up the present situation -- her markets open for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">another 15 years</ENAMEX> , with adjustments , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> can grow and not cut back , and so too , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ASEAN</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> -- then in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</ENAMEX> , the economies of these countries would be totally restructured to be able to almost sustain growth by themselves . ''
In such an arrangement , `` all benefit , '' he said .
`` And if the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Europeans</ENAMEX> come in , they benefit too .
It 's not a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</ENAMEX> - sum game . ''
Asked about the possibility of greater economic cooperation among <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> - Pacific nations , which will be discussed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 6 and 7</ENAMEX> at a ministerial meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canberra</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> said the goal `` is to have a free and open world trading system . ''
An <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> bloc is n't intended , he said .
`` That 's not possible . ''
On <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - Japan relations : `` I 'm encouraged .
I think the earlier strident notes struck by -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert -RCB- Mosbacher</ENAMEX> and -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> Trade Representative -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carla Hills</ENAMEX> have been more rounded .
I believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> is becoming more patient and circumspect , '' he said .
`` It 's the total relationship that is important . ''
The total relationship , as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> sees it , is `` the flow of dollars to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> to fund the deficits , the investments the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> are making in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> in order to satisfy <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> demand that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> products consumed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> should be made as much as possible in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> technology and capital . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's recent political turbulence , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> said , may mean <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> will slow market adjustments .
`` They 'll be more timorous in tackling their own voters , like opening up more to agricultural imports from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , hurting their farmers . ''
On <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> : Asked if his offer to allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> military to use facilities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> would help preserve <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's presence in the region at bases in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> , he said , `` What we have done is make it easier for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> to continue to host <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> bases without it being said they are lackeys of the imperialists and the only ones in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> or in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> .
We are willing to share the political burden of being host to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , an imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">power</ENAMEX> .
We think it is n't such a great burden , that it carries no stigma , and we are prepared to do it . ''
On <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - Philippine relations : `` It 's such a mixed - up relationship going back into history ... .
I really do not understand how it is that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Filipinos</ENAMEX> feel so passionately involved in this father figure that they want to dispose of and yet they need .
I just do n't understand it .
My relationships with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> are totally different .
They lorded it over me .
They did me some good .
They did themselves even more good .
They let me down when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> came down -LCB- during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> -RCB- ... .
I do n't feel down or done in because I show <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> serials on my television network or read their books .
I mean it is a normal adult relationship .
`` But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Filipinos</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> , when I talk to them , there 's so much passion about <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Filipino</ENAMEX> manhood being diminished as a result of being squatted upon by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> and so on .
The occasional Englishman tries to put on airs but we let it pass ... .
It 's just comic when they try to pretend they 're still the master race . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> added that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Filipinos</ENAMEX> are `` making it very difficult '' for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military presence to last beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five or 10 years</ENAMEX> .
On military alternatives if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> pulls back : `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> already are present .
I suppose sooner or later , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> would have to fill up a large part of the gap on the naval side .
Maybe the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> , maybe even the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indians</ENAMEX> . ''
On economic consequences of a diminished <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> presence : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is the only major power in recent history that has used its military might to sustain a system that enables all participants to equally benefit without her as the provider of the security taking royalties . ''
Asked why so few nations seem to share his views of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , he said , `` Many people see it that way .
But they have just taken it for granted . ''
On <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambodia</ENAMEX> : `` Let 's assume that -LCB- former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Cambodian</ENAMEX> leader Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norodom -RCB- Sihanouk</ENAMEX> does what the press wants him to do and joins up with -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> - backed <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Cambodian</ENAMEX> leader -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hun Sen</ENAMEX> .
Is the trouble over ?
Can <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sihanouk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hun Sen</ENAMEX> knock off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX> still supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> ?
He ca n't .
`` What is the way forward ?
To get <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX> as part of a process for elections .
And when they lose , then we can expect <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> to stop aid .
Let 's put it bluntly .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> can not be seen to have made use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX> and then discard them . ''
