The scene opens with pinstripe - suited executives -- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Easterners</ENAMEX> , obviously -- glued to cellular phones and hightailing it out of town in chauffeur - driven limousines .
`` The carpetbaggers , '' snorts the narrator with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> twang , `` have packed their bags and went . ''
But , he continues , `` They 're forgetting we 're all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texans</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Lone Star</ENAMEX> is on the rise again . ''
As the music swells , viewers discover they 're watching a commercial for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lone Star Beer</ENAMEX> , the pride of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> , a product of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">G. Heileman Brewing Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Crosse</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wis.</ENAMEX> , unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bond Corp</ENAMEX> .
As the ad 's tone implies , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> spirit is pretty xenophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lone Star</ENAMEX> is n't alone in trying to take advantage of that .
From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chevy</ENAMEX> trucks to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lipton</ENAMEX> iced tea to a host of battling banks , the state has been inundated with broadcast commercials and print advertising campaigns celebrating <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texans</ENAMEX> and castigating outsiders .
While advertisers have long appealed to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texans</ENAMEX> ' state pride and prejudices , the latest trend has been sparked , in part , by the state 's recent hard economic times .
That has taken some of the swagger out of natives who like to brag that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> is the only state that was once a nation , but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders .
In the past , writes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Houston Chronicle</ENAMEX> columnist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Barlow</ENAMEX> , outlanders were accepted only after passing a series of tests to prove they had the `` right '' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> attitudes and `` of course they had to be dipped for parasites . ''
There is no small irony in the fact that some of the most - jingoistic advertising comes courtesy of -- you guessed it -- outsiders .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lone Star 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> parent , for instance , hails from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Perth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">North Carolinians</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Californians</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chicagoans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Ohioans</ENAMEX> own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> banks .
All kinds of landmark <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> real estate has been snapped up by out - of - staters .
Even the beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cowboys</ENAMEX> were bought by an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> oil man .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> has lost its distinctiveness , leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texans</ENAMEX> with a hunger to feel proud about themselves , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Klineberg</ENAMEX> , a sociology professor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rice University</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> .
`` This plays right into the hands of the advertising agencies . ''
For example , the iced - tea radio campaign for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Thomas J. Lipton Co.</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Englewood Cliffs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Anglo - Dutch Unilever Group</ENAMEX> , emphatically proclaims : `` Real <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texans</ENAMEX> do not wear dock - siders -- ever .
Real <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texans</ENAMEX> do n't play paddleball , at least I hope not .
This is football country .
And another thing -- real <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texans</ENAMEX> drink <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lipton</ENAMEX> iced tea . ''
In developing that theme at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Interpublic Group of Cos .</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lintas</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> unit , account supervisor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Buksbaum</ENAMEX> says she made a `` couple of phone calls '' to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> ad friends and reported her `` findings '' to a team of writers .
Her findings ?
`` You know , '' she says , `` stereotypical stuff like armadillos , cowboys and football . ''
Not exactly sophisticated market research , but who cares as long as the campaigns work .
And ad agencies insist that they do .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan Richards</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Richards Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> , tells of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texan</ENAMEX> who saw the agency 's tear - jerking commercial for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Gibraltar Bank F.S.B.</ENAMEX> -- complete with the state 's anthem -- and promptly invested $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">100,000</ENAMEX> in the thrift 's CDs .
Never mind that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Gibraltar</ENAMEX> is one of the failed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> thrifts taken over by outsiders -- in this case , an investor group headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> financier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Perelman</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The North Texas Chevy Dealers</ENAMEX> recently had <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a record sales month</ENAMEX> after the debut of ad campaign that thumbs its nose at elite <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Easterners</ENAMEX> .
And deposits at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NCNB Texas National Bank</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NCNB Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.C.</ENAMEX> , have increased <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> after heavy advertising stressing commitment to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> .
`` Obviously , pride sells in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> , '' says a spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bozell Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omaha</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neb.</ENAMEX> , which represents
The ad campaigns usually follow <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> tracks -- stressing the company 's ` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texasness</ENAMEX> , ' pointing out the competition 's lack thereof , or trying to be more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texan</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texans</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> trucks may outsell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chevy</ENAMEX> trucks in places like `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Island</ENAMEX> , '' sniffs a commercial for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> , a division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Motors Corp</ENAMEX> .
The commercial , created by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bateman , Bryan -AMP- Galles Inc.</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> , adds derisively : `` I bet it takes a real tough truck to haul your Ivy League buddies to the yacht club . ''
Because they want a truck that is `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> tough , '' the commercial concludes , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texans</ENAMEX> drive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chevy</ENAMEX> . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">J.C. Penney Co.</ENAMEX> , which relocated from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> to suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> , gently wraps itself in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> pride through a full - page magazine ad : `` Taking the long - range view to conserve what is of value to future generations is part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lone Star</ENAMEX> lifestyle , '' the ad reads .
`` It 's part of our style , too . ''
According to several ad - agency sources , newcomers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> banking market are spending a combined <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> to woo <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texans</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> banking institutions are busily pitching themselves as the only lenders who truly care about the state .
The most - strident anti-outsider sentiment among bankers comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Independent Bankers Association of Texas</ENAMEX> , although it 's hard to tell from previews of the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The I 's of Texas</ENAMEX> '' TV campaign .
Commercials will highlight heart - rending scenes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and chest - swelling , ai n't - it - great - to - be - a - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texan</ENAMEX> music .
Supporting banks will sign <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">a `` Texas Declaration of Independents</ENAMEX> . ''
But in introductory material for the campaign , the trade group urges members to `` arm '' for a `` revolution '' against big , out - of - state bank - holding companies .
A video sent to association members , featuring shots of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Alamo</ENAMEX> , cowboys , fajitas and a statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Houston</ENAMEX> , does n't mince words .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texans</ENAMEX> can sniff a phony <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</ENAMEX> away , '' the narrator warns outsiders .
`` So , do n't come and try to con us with a howdy y'all or a cowboy hat . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Young -AMP- Rubicam 's</ENAMEX> Pact
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Young -AMP- Rubicam</ENAMEX> , fighting charges that it bribed <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jamaican</ENAMEX> officials to win the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jamaica Tourist Board</ENAMEX> ad account in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> , said it will no longer create the tourist board 's advertising .
In a statement , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Kroll</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Young -AMP- Rubicam 's</ENAMEX> chairman , said `` under the present circumstances -LCB- we -RCB- have agreed that it is prudent to discontinue that contract . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Young -AMP- Rubicam</ENAMEX> has pleaded innocent to the charges .
The board would n't comment on its impending search for a new ad agency to handle its estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million to $ 6 million</ENAMEX> account .
Ad Notes ... .
NEW ACCOUNT :
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sunshine Biscuits Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Woodbridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , awarded its estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million</ENAMEX> account to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Waring -AMP- LaRosa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
The account had been at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Della Femina McNamee WCRS</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
MEDIA POLICY :
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MacNamara Clapp -AMP- Klein</ENAMEX> , a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> shop , is asking magazine ad representatives to tell it when major advertising inserts will run in their publications .
It says it may pull its clients ' ads from those magazines .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">COKE</ENAMEX> ADS :
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coca - Cola Co.</ENAMEX> said it produced a new version of its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">I 'd like to teach the world to sing</ENAMEX> '' commercial .
The ad is part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Classic Coke 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> ad campaign , with the tag line , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ca n't beat the Real Thing</ENAMEX> . ''
