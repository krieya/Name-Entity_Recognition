The world had a big yuk recently when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> reported a rash of UFO landings , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of them bringing tall aliens who glowed in the dark to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Voronezh</ENAMEX> .
It is the opinion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Good</ENAMEX> , author of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Above Top Secret : The World UFO Cover - Up</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Quill / William Morrow</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">592</ENAMEX> pages , $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.95</ENAMEX> -RRB- , that the world laughs too fast .
Here is a bible for UFO watchers , complete with pictures of people who say they 've had personal relationships with aliens .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> photo shows a woman sporting a scar she says was made by a laser beam -LRB- a low - caliber weapon , from the looks of the wound -RRB- .
So far anyway , our alien visitors seem more intent on brightening our skies than pulverizing us .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good</ENAMEX> devotes much serious space to the events of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 25 , 1942</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> gunners spotted strange lights in the sky above <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
Air - raid sirens sounded the alarm at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">2:25 a.m.</ENAMEX> , summoning <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</ENAMEX> air wardens to duty .
Soon all hell broke loose .
Ground batteries , targeting an odd assortment of aircraft traveling at highly unusual speeds , opened up a furious fusillade .
The sky filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12.8 - pound</ENAMEX> shells , several of which fell back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> , destroying homes and buildings .
When the smoke cleared , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> people were dead -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> from heart attacks -RRB- , and everyone wondered what in the world they were shooting at .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good</ENAMEX> , who documents these things as best he can , provides an official explanation in the form of a memorandum from Chief of Staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George C. Marshall</ENAMEX> to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roosevelt</ENAMEX> : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,430 pounds</ENAMEX> of ammunition , '' he wrote his commander in chief , were expended on `` unidentified aircraft , '' flying at speeds as slow as <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 mph</ENAMEX> and elevations <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between 9,000 and 18,000 feet</ENAMEX> .
Well , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Californians</ENAMEX> on the scene insisted the ammo had been uselessly aimed at a large , hardy UFO , but you will just have to make your own decision about such sightings .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> thing 's for sure : There have been <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a ton</ENAMEX> of them , and greater beings than the editors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Enquirer</ENAMEX> have shown interest .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Ford</ENAMEX> , a fairly down - to - earth fellow , once sent a letter to the chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Armed Services Committee</ENAMEX> recommending that `` there be a committee investigation of the UFO phenomenon .
I think we owe it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> people to establish credibility regarding UFOs and to produce the greatest possible enlightenment on the subject . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Carter</ENAMEX> went further in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</ENAMEX> campaign promise : `` If I become president , I 'll make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public , and the scientists .
I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one ... . ''
But you know about campaign promises .
It still does n't look like governments are coughing up everything they know .
Still , despite their efforts to convince the world that we are indeed alone , the visitors do seem to keep coming and , like the recent sightings , there 's often a detail or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> that suggests they may actually be a little on the dumb side .
For instance , witnesses in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Voronezh</ENAMEX> say the pinheaded behemoths and their robot friend , after strolling around the city park , left behind some rocks .
Now why , you have to ask yourself , would intelligent beings haul a bunch of rocks around the universe ?
Or land in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> so often .
In a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</ENAMEX> incident , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> mail plane disappeared off the radar screen just after radioing its position to ground control in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> .
A search party soon found the unscathed aircraft in a forest clearing much too small to have allowed a conventional landing .
What 's more , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> mail personnel aboard were missing .
Again , you have to ask the obvious question : Why would intelligent beings kidnap <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> mailmen ?
Speculation as to the nature of aliens will no doubt continue until we wake up <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">one morning</ENAMEX> to find they 've taken over `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Today Show</ENAMEX> , '' the way they overwhelm an entire town in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Finney 's</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fireside / Simon -AMP- Schuster</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">216</ENAMEX> pages , $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.95</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Maybe some of our talk - show hosts and anchors have already been taken over ?
The point of this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</ENAMEX> novel , which spawned two movies , is that the soulless pod people replicated by alien plants are virtually indistinguishable from human folks .
Another guy who thinks they 're out there and closing fast is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitley Strieber</ENAMEX> , whose new novel , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Majestic</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Putnam</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">317</ENAMEX> pages , $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">18.95</ENAMEX> -RRB- , takes a look at a reported <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</ENAMEX> UFO crash near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Roswell Army Air Field</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> desert .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strieber</ENAMEX> knows a lot about aliens .
He even had sex with one -- sort of , and not intentionally -- as readers learned in his `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Communion</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- a book recently described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Times</ENAMEX> as a `` nonfiction best seller '' -RRB- .
The way Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strieber</ENAMEX> tells it in his earnest prose , the intelligence officer who found the craft 's strange debris was forced by the government to call the flower - inscribed scraps parts of a weather balloon .
The apparent crash became top secret , and the alien creatures went away upset with the rude ways of human beings .
We lost our chance to communicate with sweet - natured visitors `` <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about four feet</ENAMEX> tall -LCB- who -RCB- looked as though they were made of puffed - up marshmallow . ''
