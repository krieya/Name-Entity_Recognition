After failing to find a buyer for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Sears Tower</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sears , Roebuck -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> is negotiating with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> pension fund adviser <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Aldrich , Eastman -AMP- Waltch Inc.</ENAMEX> to refinance the property for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $ 850 million</ENAMEX> , according to people close to the negotiations .
Under the proposed agreement involving the world 's tallest building , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sears</ENAMEX> would receive <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</ENAMEX> the money through conventional mortgage financing and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> as a convertible mortgage .
At the end of the term of the convertible loan , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sears</ENAMEX> could still own half the building , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AEW</ENAMEX> could own the other <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> .
Neither side would comment .
The parties are currently negotiating over who would manage the building , which will be emptied of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</ENAMEX> employees from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sears</ENAMEX> ' merchandise group , which is moving elsewhere .
The new manager will face the daunting task of leasing <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.8 million square feet</ENAMEX> in a relatively soft <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> real estate market .
Also , it has not yet been decided exactly how much of the mortgage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AEW</ENAMEX> will be able to convert into equity .
Convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way to finance prestigious buildings of late .
In a convertible mortgage , the investor lends the building owner a certain amount in return for the option to convert its interest into equity , usually <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50 %</ENAMEX> , at the end of the loan term .
During the term , the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow , a percentage of the building 's appreciation or a fixed return .
The main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sears</ENAMEX> said it would put the 110 - story tower on the block <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">almost a year ago</ENAMEX> as part of its anti-takeover restructuring .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> institutions shied away from bidding on the high - profile tower out of fear their purchase of the property would trigger <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="5">anti-Japanese</ENAMEX> sentiment .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last summer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sears</ENAMEX> appeared to have a deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> developer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Olympia -AMP- York Developments Ltd</ENAMEX> .
But that deal fell through in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> after it became clear that the sale would lead to a major real estate tax reassessment , raising property taxes , and making it difficult to lease the building at competitive prices .
Real estate industry executives said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sears</ENAMEX> ' investment banker , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Goldman , Sachs -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , sought financing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
However , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> authorities apparently were concerned that a refinancing also would attract too much publicity .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sears</ENAMEX> then went back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AEW</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> pension adviser that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> round of bids <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last spring</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AEW</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.5 billion</ENAMEX> of real estate investments nationwide , according to a spokesman .
