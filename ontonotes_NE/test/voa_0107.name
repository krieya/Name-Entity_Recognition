<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Legend of Bagger Vance</ENAMEX> directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Redford</ENAMEX> is the latest movie to bring the game of golf to the screen and is one of the most popular attractions of theaters in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> .
Entertainment reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuck Rich</ENAMEX> discussed this and previous golf films with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VOA</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Arlington</ENAMEX> .
The movies ' The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Natural</ENAMEX> ' and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">' Field of Dreams '</ENAMEX> brought mystical and nostalgic qualities to baseball and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Legend of Bagger Vance</ENAMEX> , set during the economic depression over the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1920s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1930s</ENAMEX> , does the same thing for golf .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will Smith</ENAMEX> plays a caddy who revives the confidence , as well as the skill of a golfer whose glory has faded .
You know I understood everything <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will Smith</ENAMEX> said in films like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'' Men in Black ''</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'' Independence Day</ENAMEX> . ''
What was he talking about there ?
Beats the heck out of me .
Seriously , I think golf and many golf films can be whatever you interpret them to be , what the player or the moviegoer decides they 'll be .
Some people consider golf to be a silly and dull game , following a little ball around the course , others , including some filmmakers , view it as a symbol or as a gauge of a person 's philosophy or psychology .
For example in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> movie <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'' Tin Cup ''</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Costner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheech Merrin</ENAMEX> , what might be an embarrassing experience in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> golfer 's past is for him a badge of honor .
Do you have to like golf to like golf movies ?
It helps , but it 's not necessary .
Some filmmakers and performers used golf as a setting for broad comedy with potential appeal both inside and outside of the sport .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> golf movie <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'' Happy Gilmore ''</ENAMEX> starring and co-written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam Sandler</ENAMEX> , placed the temperamental ice hockey player in a professional sport that some people consider refined .
Golf can be a very frustrating game .
So , any golfer I guess would understand that gag in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'' Happy Gilmore</ENAMEX> . ''
And anyone who dislikes or is bored by golf , might appreciate seeing the game played for laughs there .
What is your take on golf movies ?
I only play miniature golf and I do n't watch golf on television .
I think I am one of the people filmmakers are thinking of , when they try to give a golf movie wide appeal , humor , or a love story for example .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> film that 's attracted a lot of golf loving fans over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'' Caddy Shack ''</ENAMEX> .
Set at the exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bush Wood</ENAMEX> country club , it 's about class conflict or as movie advertising sometimes calls it , the snobs versus the flops .
Here is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> golfer in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'' Caddy Shack ''</ENAMEX> played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodney Dangerfield</ENAMEX> , bothering another , a judge played by the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Night</ENAMEX> .
As a comedian , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodney Dangerfield</ENAMEX> often says he gets no respect , but were n't the filmmakers really showing their respect for him and his drawing power by casting him in this film ?
I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dangerfield</ENAMEX> was a big selling point who attracted a lot of his fans , who include me , to see <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'' Caddy Shack</ENAMEX> . ''
I do n't think it 's a very good film , but it 's a popular one and the music in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'' Caddy Shack ''</ENAMEX> got some attention too .
We 're going to finish up our cinematic round of golf with some of that .
Thank you , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuck</ENAMEX> .
You 're welcome , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave</ENAMEX> .
