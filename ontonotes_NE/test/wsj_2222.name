What happened <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated to handle another meltdown in prices .
No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling .
But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency .
After the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> plunge , markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> adopted <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> specific circuit breakers : If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> index falls <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</ENAMEX> points in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</ENAMEX> , the exchange will halt trading for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</ENAMEX> ; if the decline hits <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</ENAMEX> points , the exchange will close for an additional <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</ENAMEX> .
The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels .
It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic .
A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself .
But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices .
What happened <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> was the worst of all worlds .
The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">about 3 p.m.</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</ENAMEX> , after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Standard -AMP- Poor 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> stock index had fallen <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> points , or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</ENAMEX> points on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> index .
Options markets stopped trading in many securities .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , under its own rules , remained open .
With nowhere else to go , sellers , and particularly program traders , focused all their selling on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
As liquidity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply .
Had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">3:30</ENAMEX> , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , the futures exchanges reopened .
Futures trading , however , was halted altogether at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">3:45</ENAMEX> , after the futures markets had dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 30</ENAMEX> points , which is the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> limit for price declines .
At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
It is time to recognize that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , the futures markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> market effectively .
Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them .
It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers .
To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none .
Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions .
It 's time for the exchanges and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open .
Let 's not have <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> market shut down for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</ENAMEX> when the Dow declines <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> points and another shut down for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</ENAMEX> after a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</ENAMEX> - point decline .
The need for hurried last - minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets .
The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that futures and options trading continue as long as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> remains open .
The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies .
Should the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commodities Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX> -LRB- which , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> , regulates the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> stock - index markets -RRB- be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> secretary .
In many ways , our financial markets are better prepared <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> to handle a decline than they were <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> now has the capacity to handle a volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly a billion</ENAMEX> shares a day .
Telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers , and specialists -- who I believe should stay , despite the urgings of some post-crash critics -- have larger capital positions .
-LRB- Of course , specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices .
Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early Friday</ENAMEX> and opened <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Monday</ENAMEX> because of an excess of sell orders . -RRB-
But the task of improving market performance remains unfinished .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freund</ENAMEX> , former chief economist of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , is a professor of economics at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pace University 's</ENAMEX> business school in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
