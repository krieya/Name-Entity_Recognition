The art of calligraphy is a special kind of art form in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
Each period has its own superior achievements , which combine to make a brilliant and glorious calligraphy history .
This is exactly why the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> art of calligraphy wins the strong admiration of friends from many countries of the world .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> friends Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sackler</ENAMEX> and his wife , have wholeheartedly contributed a lot to carrying forward our art of calligraphy , and hope to introduce this brilliant art to the world , to let more friends learn and treasure it .
We appreciate their absolute sincerity .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> recently held " <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Sackler Cup Calligraphy Competition</ENAMEX> " selected , recommended and widely solicited calligraphy works and treasures of recently budding calligraphers scattered in various places , and has been deeply welcomed by readers .
In the appraisal and selection process , the standards we emphasized were : conforming to classical requirements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> art of calligraphy ; healthy language diction , readable handwriting ; certain standards of writing methods ; solid skills , and self - establishing a new artistic concept -- these are the characteristics of our <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> art of calligraphy , and because we have these characteristics , we won the attention of foreign friends .
Therefore , any work that can follow tradition but not stagnate , and have new artistic concepts will be appraised well .
In a serious yet harmonious discussion , the judges thinking achieved unity and decided this round 's outstanding entries .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> kind of situation embarrassed the judges , namely , that some works displayed really beautifully written characters , conformed to a certain calligraphy style , and showed signs of new achievement in art form , but regretfully , because the calligraphers have poor basic knowledge , they wrote some wrong characters , and since there was no remedy , finally lost in the selection .
Everyone both felt pity for them , and felt that this is an issue very worth worrying about .
Some young calligraphy lovers , just at the time when they should have been studying hard , were hindered .
So basic knowledge was not enough , structure was not systematic , and the level was rather low .
They have some ability in calligraphy , but eventually can not produce a final masterpiece at a higher level , and can not create works which may be used as teaching models .
We sincerely hope that these friends will amend this aspect quickly , and hope future works will show both superior capability in calligraphy , and convey healthy and deep thoughts , and even reveal a clear , meaningful and elegant mind .
This is the eager expectation that many older - generation calligraphers have placed on us younger - generation .
