<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbas</ENAMEX> ' decision to hold presidential and parliamentary elections is the last attempt in a series of many plots to derail the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamists</ENAMEX> ' power - sharing in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> territories .
Unfortunately , these attempts are backed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> and internationally ... with local instigation , help and execution by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbas</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Fatah</ENAMEX> movement ... which has found itself outside the game ... after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> people had their say in the last elections .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbas</ENAMEX> and his group and his supporters abroad were gambling on the timing of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hamas</ENAMEX> ' fall ... through the economic and political blockade imposed on it ...
But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hamas</ENAMEX> has managed to come through its first difficult days in power ... and has managed to establish its presence through its continued and sincere work in spite of circumstances that were enough to bring down any other government .
As time passed , they felt that time was not on their side ... and that , as time passed , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hamas</ENAMEX> and its project and proposals were becoming deeply rooted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> political and social reality ... especially after the recent successful tour by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ismail Haniya</ENAMEX> to a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslim</ENAMEX> countries .
Therefore , these parties have realized that the time has come to throw in the final card in a series of plots and treachery ... by means of a coup against <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hamas</ENAMEX> through a call for elections .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbas</ENAMEX> and his group are facing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hamas</ENAMEX> because it has succeeded ... if it had failed or if it was expected to fail ... they would have left it until it completed its lawful term ... in order to abort its legitimacy ... its project ... and its popularity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> arena .
Its success strips them bare and shows their real size ... and brings down their proposals and projects .
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> want to topple <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hamas</ENAMEX> because it is the first government formed by elected <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamists</ENAMEX> ... and this threatens the mummified <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> governments ... these relics that have been here for dozens of years !
In spite of their failure ... and lack of popular legitimacy .
