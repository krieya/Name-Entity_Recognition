<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> has climbed up from the ashes of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> and a gross national product of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 800</ENAMEX> per capita to reach the heavyweight class among industrialized nations .
Now this remarkable economic growth seems to be coming to an end because the government has not converted itself into a modern , democratic , `` developed nation '' mode of operation .
Until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> joined the $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000</ENAMEX> per capita GNP club of the advanced countries , it was a model developing nation .
The government built ports , bridges , highways , schools , hospitals and railways .
When industries were weak , it protected them .
It gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> people a value system , based on the rationalization that given the country 's lack of natural resources , they must work hard to create value through exports and buy food with the surplus .
Individual prosperity inevitably would result .
That system has worked .
The standard of living has increased steadily over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 40 years</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 90 %</ENAMEX> of the people consider themselves middle class .
The people have given their leading and only credible political party , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Liberal Democratic Party</ENAMEX> , clear and uninterrupted power for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">those 40 years</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> won by a landslide in the last election , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1986</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">less than two years later</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> started to crumble , and dissent rose to unprecedented heights .
The symptoms all point to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing : <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> does not have a modern government .
Its government still wants to sit in the driver 's seat , set the speed , step on the gas , apply the brakes and steer , with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120 million</ENAMEX> people in the back seat .
In a modern system , the government 's role is to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are capable of making a choice .
It also allows people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> government does n't allow this .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery</ENAMEX> actually is a ministry for farmers and fishermen instead of a ministry of provisions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Ministry of Health and Welfare</ENAMEX> is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization dedicated to protecting the health of the people .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Ministry of Education</ENAMEX> is nothing but a cartel for licensed teachers , and certainly does not act on behalf of students .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Ministry of Construction</ENAMEX> spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world , but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Ministry of Transportation</ENAMEX> serves the industry , certainly not the passengers who must pay extraordinarily high prices .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ENAMEX> works for itself , supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> diplomats who sprinkle abundant aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host 's .
This ministry has done nothing to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's deteriorating image .
Instead , it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries .
All this illustrates that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> ministries still have a `` provider '' mentality ; they do not serve the people , and particularly not consumers .
They serve the industries and the special - interest groups .
The rest of the world accepted such methods when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> was developing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> put up with it because the government provided job stability and growing paychecks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> is not a political country .
It is a bureaucratic country .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Diet</ENAMEX> plays a minor role compared with the powerful bureaucratic system .
Most bills are drafted by bureaucrats , not politicians .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Diet</ENAMEX> does n't normally even debate bills because the opposition parties are so often opposed to whatever <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> does that it would be a waste of time .
So most bills are passed without full discussion ; particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties .
A recent example is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</ENAMEX> consumption tax on all commercial activities .
This makes enormous sense in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , where direct tax accounts for more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</ENAMEX> of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair .
If you are a salaried man , Amen ! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</ENAMEX> captured .
If you are a retailer , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> , and a farmer , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> .
To correct this inequality , most people would have favored an indirect tax , like the consumption tax .
But the bill was passed without debate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Diet</ENAMEX> , in the absence of the opposition .
As a result , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> people did n't know what to expect when the new law was introduced on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1</ENAMEX> .
They were frustrated by the longer queues at the cashier and the small coins given as change .
All of a sudden , prices were no longer in denominations of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</ENAMEX> .
They were <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">206</ENAMEX> .
Pockets exploded with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">one - yen</ENAMEX> coins .
While people were jingling their change , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> politicians were caught in scandals .
Money , such as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Recruit</ENAMEX> 's political donations , and women , as in the cases of Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sosuke Uno</ENAMEX> and Secretary General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tokuo Yamashita</ENAMEX> , seldom have caused political scandals in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
Whereas most men were a bit ambivalent about the sex scandals -LRB- though they were furious about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Recruit</ENAMEX> -RRB- , women were upset about both and surged to the polls .
In the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Upper House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> metropolitan congressional elections , in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Socialist Party</ENAMEX> won a runaway victory , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> of all women voted , as opposed to the usual <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> .
It is difficult to analyze how much of their anger was due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Recruit</ENAMEX> , the sex scandals , or the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">one - yen</ENAMEX> coins in their purses , but they obviously were voting to punish the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> .
Taken by surprise , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Socialist Party</ENAMEX> is busy changing its doctrines .
It 's now OK to deal with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , but not <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
Nuclear power plants are acceptable .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">The U.S. - Japan Security Treaty</ENAMEX> can continue , sort of .
And so on .
Against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Socialist Party</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> has been paralyzed .
Now is the time to reform the government from a provider , developing - country vanguard role to that of a modern , industrialized nation in which consumers have the ultimate choice .
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> , as currently composed , ca n't make the transformation , then it should split into <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> parties .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> party could stand for consumer interests , small government , free trade and globalism to put <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> clearly among the most developed and open countries .
The other party could continue on the traditional track of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> , representing the manufacturers ' preference for larger government , control , regulation and protectionism .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> must make a decision immediately ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lower House</ENAMEX> elections must take place before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> .
In the current mood of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> people , journalists and even some industrialists , giving power to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Socialists</ENAMEX> might be good for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> , cleansing it of past sins .
We must not forget , however , that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real - estate and financial markets .
At the most there is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only nine months</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> fuse burns out .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ohmae</ENAMEX> is managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McKinsey -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
