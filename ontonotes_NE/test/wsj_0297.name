Everything looked good as neurosurgeon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Levy</ENAMEX> and colleagues carefully cut away a woman 's spinal tumor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Cleveland Clinic</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</ENAMEX> .
Using small electrical shocks applied to her feet , they were able to monitor sensory nerves .
The shocks generated nerve impulses that traveled via spine to brain and showed up clearly on a brain - wave monitor , indicating no damage to the delicate spinal tissue .
Then , says Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levy</ENAMEX> , `` she woke up paralyzed . ''
The damage was to her motor nerves , which could n't be monitored along with the sensory nerves , he explains .
The tragedy , he adds , `` galvanized me '' to look for a way to prevent similar cases .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levy</ENAMEX> 's answer may come with a new kind of magnetic brain probe , a device that he and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> researchers are studying with great hope .
Besides holding the promise of safer spinal surgery , the probe could improve the diagnosis of brain and nerve disorders such as strokes and multiple sclerosis .
Perhaps most exciting , the device is thrusting open a window to the workings of the brain .
The probe , which is painless , non-invasive and apparently harmless , employs strong magnetic fields to induce small whirlwinds of electricity within the brain .
If positioned over the brain 's motor - control area , the hand - held electromagnets generate nerve impulses that zip down motor nerves and activate muscles , making , say , a finger twitch .
In principle , they will enable doctors to check the body 's motor system the way an electrician tests a home 's electrical circuits by running current through them .
`` Until now , we 've had no objective way of measuring motor function , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith Chiappa</ENAMEX> , a neurologist conducting clinical tests with the devices at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Massachusetts General Hospital</ENAMEX> .
`` All we could do was tell a patient , ` squeeze my fingers as hard as you can ' or ` raise your arm . '
`` Under the best circumstances such tests are subjective ; when a patient is unconscious , they do n't work at all .
Magnetic brain tweaking started in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1900s</ENAMEX> , when researchers produced flashes of light in the visual field with magnets .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1960s</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mayo Clinic</ENAMEX> researchers developed magnetic devices to stimulate motor nerves in the hand and other limbs .
But for brain tests , the unwieldy machines `` would have required patients to stand on their heads , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reginald Bickford</ENAMEX> , a researcher at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of California at San Diego</ENAMEX> .
The field took off in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> after scientists at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sheffield University</ENAMEX> developed a handy , compact magnet for brain stimulation .
Since then , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</ENAMEX> commercial versions have been put on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> market , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 500</ENAMEX> have been sold .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> conference on such devices attracted <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</ENAMEX> researchers , who reported studies on everything from brain mapping to physical therapy .
`` We do n't feel we can use -LCB- the devices -RCB- routinely in surgery yet , but we 're getting close , '' says Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levy</ENAMEX> , who is now with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> .
A problem , he adds , is that anesthetized brains are more resistant to magnetic stimulation than awake ones .
The devices could help indicate when surgery would help , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Tator</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">University of Toronto</ENAMEX> neurosurgeon .
For example , paralyzed car - crash victims occasionally have some intact spinal tissues that , if preserved by emergency surgery , enable partial recovery .
But such operations typically are n't performed because there is no sign right after an injury that surgery would be beneficial .
`` The cost -LCB- of magnetic stimulators -RCB- would seem like peanuts if we could retrieve limb function '' in such people , Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tator</ENAMEX> says .
Scientists caution there is a chance the magnet technique might spark seizures in epileptics .
But no significant problems have been reported among <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of people tested with the devices .
The main sensation , besides feeling like a puppet jerked with invisible strings , is `` like a rap on the head , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Bridgers</ENAMEX> , a neurologist who has studied the brain stimulators at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yale University</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> apparent side effect is a minor increase in a brain hormone .
And some doctors who have conducted <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</ENAMEX> of tests on themselves report temporary headaches .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least two</ENAMEX> companies , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cadwell Laboratories Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kennewick</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wash.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Novametrix Medical Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wallingford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , now sell versions of the magnetic devices .
The machines , which at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">12,500</ENAMEX> are inexpensive by medical standards , have n't been approved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> for marketing as brain stimulators but are sold for stimulating nerves in the hand , legs and other non-brain areas .
Researchers can apply for permission to use the probes for brain studies .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of Kentucky</ENAMEX> , a team led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Currier</ENAMEX> , a physical therapy researcher , is testing the stimulators in conjunction with electric shocks to induce muscle contractions to help prevent wasting of thigh muscles after knee surgery .
Similarly , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Purdue University</ENAMEX> team led by heart researcher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.A. Tacker</ENAMEX> hopes to develop ways to magnetically induce cardiac muscle contractions .
The devices might someday serve as temporary pacemakers or restarters for stopped hearts , says Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tacker</ENAMEX> , whose prototype was dubbed the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tacker</ENAMEX> whacker . ''
The devices ' most remarkable possibilities , though , involve the brain .
Probing with the stimulators , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> scientists recently showed how the brain reorganizes motor - control resources after an amputation .
Similar studies are expected to reveal how stroke patients ' brains regroup -- a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> step toward finding ways to bolster that process and speed rehabilitation .
Scientists also are exploring memory and perception with the new machines .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State University of New York at Brooklyn</ENAMEX> , researchers flash <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> groups of different letters on a computer screen in front of human guinea pigs .
Between flashes , certain areas in subjects ' brains are jolted with a magnetic stimulator .
When the jolt is timed just right , the subjects do n't recall seeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> group of letters .
`` Where does that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> stimulus go ? '' exclaims <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SUNY</ENAMEX> neurologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Maccabee</ENAMEX> .
`` Trying to answer that is suggesting all kinds of theories , '' such as precisely where and how the brain processes incoming signals from the eyes .
He and others say that the machines are weak enough that they do n't jeopardize the memory .
Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SUNY</ENAMEX> team and researchers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Magnet Laboratory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , are working with more potent magnetic brain stimulators .
Among other things , the stronger devices may be able to summon forth <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> - forgotten memories and induce mood changes , neurologists say .
