Well , the arrogant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East Coast</ENAMEX> media have spoken again -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Going for the Green</ENAMEX> , '' editorial , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 17</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Having resided in the great state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past seven years</ENAMEX> , I find it hard to ignore our environmental problems when I start my commute to work with eyes tearing and head aching from the polluted air ; when I try to enjoy the beaches and come home covered with tar and oil ; when I hear of numerous deaths related to irresponsible processing of cheese and use of chemicals in fruit growing .
Perhaps it 's entertaining for those like you to discount the concerns of environmentalists , suggesting that their save - the - earth initiatives are `` whacky '' and referring to so many citizens as `` la - la activists . ''
Strange that we do n't hear similar criticisms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East Coast</ENAMEX> activists who seek to clean up <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Boston Harbor</ENAMEX> or rid their beaches of medical waste .
While there are no easy low - cost solutions , simply ignoring our problems will result in their severity increasing and spreading throughout the state , the nation and the world .
If nothing else , such initiatives as these will provide an awareness to citizens and lawmakers and encourage appropriate corrective action .
Before your next <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> - bashing editorial , please spend more time out here witnessing the situation -- it just may change your view .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Barry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ventura</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif</ENAMEX> .
I realize you were just looking for something snotty to say about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and its environmental movement , but picking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright</ENAMEX> to say it for you was a bad call .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> 's organic architecture demonstrated a keen sensitivity to the environment <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</ENAMEX> before it became fashionable among `` la - la activists . ''
Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> said all his life that the greatest lessons he learned were derived from the study of nature .
Obviously , it 's lost on you that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 75 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> people <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> -LRB- and in fact the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> -RRB- consider themselves environmentalists .
As for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> being a state run by liberal environmental loonies , let 's not forget where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> came from .
Perhaps Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> , who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees , is the man you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> .
But it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright</ENAMEX> who said , `` Is this not Anti-Christ ?
The Moloch that knows no God but more ? ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Borden</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Monica</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif .</ENAMEX>
Your editorial was commendable and neatly matched by the readers ' comments in letters to the editor , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Alar : Scaring on the Side of Caution</ENAMEX> . ''
The illogic and inaccuracy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John H. Adams 's</ENAMEX> comments for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Resources Defense Council</ENAMEX> fully justifies your characterization of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Greens</ENAMEX> in particular as `` la - la activists . ''
We may all hope that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's voters will heed the scientific realities that their own university 's renowned Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Jukes</ENAMEX> provides them and ignore the charlatanry profferred by their `` wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> weepers . ''
I have a different approach to offer , not only to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Californians</ENAMEX> , but to all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> .
In a free country , the law should restrict citizens as little as is consistent with good manners and public safety .
Would - be naysayers should have the burden of proving reasonable necessity when they urge a prohibition for enactment into law .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Brown Morton Jr .</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170</ENAMEX> airlines in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Air Transport Association</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> posted group net profit of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.5 billion</ENAMEX> on revenue of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 125.1 billion</ENAMEX> .
According to the association 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> report , scheduled to be released <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IATA</ENAMEX> members have n't posted such a strong performance since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</ENAMEX> .
Revenue <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> increased by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 11 %</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , and net income nearly tripled from restated <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year - earlier</ENAMEX> net of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 900 million</ENAMEX> .
The group attributed the strong results to the favorable economic climate , rising demand for air travel and improved average yield -LRB- revenue received per ton of traffic transported <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a kilometer</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Systemwide , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IATA</ENAMEX> airlines carried <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">632 million</ENAMEX> passengers <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</ENAMEX> more than in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> .
But passenger - kilometers , the distance flown while carrying people , increased <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> .
The association said that lack of airport and air space capacity is the biggest problem facing the airline industry .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KGB</ENAMEX> has abolished a unit known for persecuting dissidents , the government newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Izvestia</ENAMEX> said .
The newspaper quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KGB</ENAMEX> chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir A. Kryuchkov</ENAMEX> as saying the definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="5">anti-Soviet</ENAMEX> crimes had narrowed , the laws had changed and people no longer have to fear a simple slip of the tongue .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kryuchkov</ENAMEX> was quoted as saying that in place of the infamous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">5th Directorate</ENAMEX> a new unit would work `` to foil the conspiracies of foreign intelligence services to create and use organized anti-government groups in our country . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX> has restricted consumer - goods exports to neighbor countries because of `` massive buying out of food '' by tourists from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rude Pravo</ENAMEX> daily said .
Rising inflation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> makes <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Czechoslovak</ENAMEX> food , clothing and shoes relatively cheap for visitors from these countries .
The paper gave no details of what the restrictions would entail but said the measures were necessary to protect the domestic market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany 's</ENAMEX> biggest union , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IG Metall</ENAMEX> , said it is ready to back demands for more pay and shorter <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</ENAMEX> with strikes against the nation 's automotive , steel and engineering industries .
Its chairman told the union to prepare for the worst in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year 's</ENAMEX> confrontation with employers over a new <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - year</ENAMEX> wage deal .
A major goal is to cut <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the working week</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">35 hours</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the present 37</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> came news of alarm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> over a plan to tap gas fields off the city 's coast .
Now comes word from a scientist that over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next century</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> will sink nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> times faster than the present rate because of the `` greenhouse effect . ''
`` Global warming means higher tides which will lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">another 23 inches</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 100 years</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Cecconi</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the the New Venice Consortium</ENAMEX> said .
The consortium of scientists and companies was set up by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> to help preserve the fabled city of canals .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> has sunk <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 inches</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Quelle</ENAMEX> said it will establish a mail - order operation with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> local partners in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
Saying this is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> for a Western company , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany 's</ENAMEX> largest mail - order group said the newly established <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intermoda company</ENAMEX> is scheduled to begin operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1990</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intermoda</ENAMEX> will initially only send the textile and clothing section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Quelle</ENAMEX> catalog , translated into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> customers who have access to convertible currency .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The European Community Commission</ENAMEX> has imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South Korean</ENAMEX> small - screen color - television sets .
Saying that a surge in low - priced imports had damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> producers ' profits and led to job losses , the commission imposed a duty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.2 %</ENAMEX> on TVs made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daewoo</ENAMEX> , a duty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.3 %</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Goldstar Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Samsung</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.6 %</ENAMEX> on TVs made by other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South Korean</ENAMEX> producers .
The commission said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> television producers lost `` important market shares '' and suffered an `` unsustainable '' pressure on prices because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Korean</ENAMEX> companies ' marketing and pricing policies , which it said were `` in clear violation '' of international trade rules .
In other news concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea 's</ENAMEX> television industry , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Samsung</ENAMEX> signed an agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Soyuz</ENAMEX> , the external - trade organization of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , to swap <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Korean</ENAMEX> television sets and videocassette recorders for pig iron from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> have no diplomatic relations but exchanged trade offices <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sri Lanka</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 15,000</ENAMEX> people have died in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</ENAMEX> of ethnic turmoil , said it will ban sex and violence from state - owned television <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
`` Many programs we have now come from the West and are not suitable to our culture , '' a government minister said .
A star attraction on the national network is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dynasty</ENAMEX> . '' ...
A poll of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South Koreans</ENAMEX> showed overwhelming opposition to efforts to curb dog - meat consumption just because it offends foreigners .
