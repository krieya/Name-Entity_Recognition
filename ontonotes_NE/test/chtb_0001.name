The development of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pudong</ENAMEX> is in step with the establishment of its legal system
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Xinhua News Agency</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February 10</ENAMEX> , by wire -LRB- reporters <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jinhu Xie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chijian Zhang</ENAMEX> -RRB-
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pudong</ENAMEX> has promulgated and implemented <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</ENAMEX> regulatory documents relating to areas such as economics , trade , construction , planning , science and technology , culture and education , etc. , ensuring the orderly advancement of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pudong</ENAMEX> 's development .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pudong</ENAMEX> 's development and opening up is a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">century</ENAMEX> - spanning undertaking for vigorously promoting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> and constructing a modern economic , trade , and financial center .
Because of this , new situations and new questions that have not been encountered before are emerging in great numbers .
In response to this , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pudong</ENAMEX> is not simply adopting an approach of " work for a short time and then draw up laws and regulations only after waiting until experience has been accumulated . "
Instead , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pudong</ENAMEX> is taking advantage of the lessons from experience of developed countries and special regions such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shenzhen</ENAMEX> by hiring appropriate domestic and foreign specialists and scholars , by actively and promptly formulating and issuing regulatory documents , and by ensuring that these economic activities are incorporated into the sphere of influence of the legal system as soon as they appear .
Precisely because as soon as it opened it was relatively standardized , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> drug purchase service center for medical treatment institutions , which came into being at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of last year</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pudong</ENAMEX> new region , in operating up to now , has concluded transactions for drugs of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">over 100 million yuan</ENAMEX> and has n't had <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> case of kickback .
Construction is a principal economic activity in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pudong</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">These years</ENAMEX> there have been <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</ENAMEX> construction companies and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over four thousand</ENAMEX> construction sites that have spread out all over this stretch of hot turf .
In order to standardize construction procedures and to guard against the emergence of disorderly phenomena , the new region 's management committee promptly announced a series of documents for standardizing the construction market in accordance with the relevant national regulations and the regulations of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai Municipality</ENAMEX> , while accommodating the realities of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pudong</ENAMEX> 's development .
The documents include : management methods for bidding on construction projects ; a certain number of regulations for demolition and removal work ; implementation methods for fixing construction that violated regulations ; construction suggestions for communications installations and cable setups ; provisional methods for environmental management at construction work sites ; etc .
Essentially they are worked out to the point where every single link has clearly defined and specific regulations .
When a construction company enters the region , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> the appropriate bureau delivers these regulatory documents , and afterwards there is a specialized contingent that carries out a supervisory inspection .
In spite of the fact that of the regulatory documents that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pudong</ENAMEX> new region has formulated , some are relatively " crude " and some are still only provisional regulations awaiting step - by - step completion as they are put into practice , nevertheless , this kind of approach , with the legal system tightly coupled with economic and social activities , has received positive comments from domestic and foreign investors .
They believe that in coming to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pudong</ENAMEX> new region to invest there is methodicalness and attention to rules in the handling of business , and interests can receive safeguards .
