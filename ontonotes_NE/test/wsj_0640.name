Retailers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> and parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South</ENAMEX> are entering the critical <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas shopping season</ENAMEX> with more momentum than those in other regions .
In a new report , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Council of Shopping Centers</ENAMEX> said sales of general merchandise in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first seven months of 1989</ENAMEX> rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.6 %</ENAMEX> above <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year - earlier</ENAMEX> levels .
Sales increased a more modest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.8 %</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.4 %</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Midwest</ENAMEX> .
But sales in the oil - patch state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> surged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.9 %</ENAMEX> and sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> jumped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.6 %</ENAMEX> in the period , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> trade group said .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northeast</ENAMEX> , however , sales declined <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4 %</ENAMEX> in the period , with sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">New England</ENAMEX> falling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.6 %</ENAMEX> .
The numbers show that `` we do n't have a monolithic economy , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Lagnado</ENAMEX> , council research director .
`` There are a lot of have and have - not markets . ''
Sales nationally rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 %</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the latest month</ENAMEX> for which the figures are available , the council said .
The Northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> are likely to temporarily damp sales growth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lagnado</ENAMEX> predicted the regional trends would continue through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</ENAMEX> .
`` The big mo is as much of a factor in retailing as in politics , '' he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">The Christmas quarter</ENAMEX> is important to retailers because it represents <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly a third</ENAMEX> of their sales and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</ENAMEX> of their profits .
The council 's report is based on data the trade group buys from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Census Bureau</ENAMEX> .
The information on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</ENAMEX> metropolitan markets is supplied by retailers such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sears , Roebuck -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">K mart Corp.</ENAMEX> as well as closely held concerns such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">R.H. Macy -AMP- Co</ENAMEX> .
The council plans to release its regional reports <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lagnado</ENAMEX> said strength in employment appears to have the biggest impact on sales growth .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> strongest retail markets in the nation , are all located in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> , where employment grew a relatively strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> , which has lost jobs in the computer and defense - related industries , was the weakest link in bleak <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">New England</ENAMEX> .
The results reflect a reversal in the fortunes of the regions during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> had the slowest sales growth , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Midwest</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> respectively , according to the council .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lagnado</ENAMEX> said that although retailers probably wo n't ever recover sales lost because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> quake and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> , they could see some benefits later on .
Stores such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sears</ENAMEX> that sell big - ticket durable goods might actually get a boost as consumers rush to replace items lost in the disasters , he said .
