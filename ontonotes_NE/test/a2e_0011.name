The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> system acts arbitrarily away from the law
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asaad</ENAMEX>
I did not read the article .
=======
The annual report of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in the Arabian Peninsula</ENAMEX> :
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">6/01/2007</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Al - Quds Al - 'Arabi</ENAMEX> " from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed Al - masri</ENAMEX> :
In the opinion of the annual report issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in the Arabian Peninsula</ENAMEX> what facilitates the the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> system 's abuses of human rights is the set of governmental administrative regulations that are not based on justice and equality , and which are a part of the state structure that is far removed from legal accountability , be it to independent international organizations or local civil groups .
This is what makes the system act arbitrarily .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</ENAMEX> report on human rights abuses in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Arabian Peninsula</ENAMEX> prepared by the committee , criticized the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> 's lack of a constitution regulating the course of the country , stating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> regime missed a fundamental element on which any political system is based .
This element is the constitution which regulates the course of the country and the rights of the ruler and the ruled at various levels .
Thus far , there is no written constitution for the country .
It added that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> laws are not written down and are obscure , and despite the fact that the government 's basic law deals with some of the main legal issues , nevertheless it is not a constitution .
The report also criticized the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> 's legal system , pointing out that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Judicial Council</ENAMEX> appoints judges , posts them and dismisses them , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Justice</ENAMEX> also holds judges accountable .
It deemed that the judges are not independent and are subject to pressures from senior members of the ruling family and from senior government officials to influence their decisions .
Also , the members of the public and members of the royal family are not actually equal before the judicial system .
In its opinion the government has continued to commit serious violations .
The restrictions imposed on the media and the internet have also continued , as well as the repression of minorities , especially of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Ismailis</ENAMEX> .
The government has continued to ignore the wish of the people for a responsible government which can be held accountable and questioned .
It accused the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> of using the law as a repressive political weapon or tool against the society at a time when the aim of the law is to protect the individual 's human rights from the power of the state .
In its opinion , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> criminal justice system facilitates detainees being exposed to harm during the period they are in custody and under investigation , the reason for this being the lack of judicial supervision .
What makes the abuses increasingly grave is that the main arresting authorities , these being the public security forces , the public investigation forces and the religious police , do not fall under any judicial supervision .
The report stressed that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the most important loopholes in the basic governing system is its failure to recognize the right to the freedom of expression and belief , and pointed out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> government does not allow political parties and puts stringent restrictions on the freedom of expression .
It brought to attention the fact that the number of citizens banned from traveling abroad for political reasons has exceeded <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 thousand</ENAMEX> .
It added that reports estimate <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an approximate 6 thousand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiite</ENAMEX> citizens from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Eastern Region</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Medina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Najran</ENAMEX> are banned from leaving the country .
Passports are being confiscated without a court order and there are many reasons for confiscation - from traveling to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> to other unknown reasons .
The report indicated that the basic governance system does not recognize the right to peaceful assembly , considering that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> regime puts all kinds of difficulties in the way of the religious , cultural and educational activities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiites</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> .
The report accused the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi</ENAMEX> regime of banning <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiites</ENAMEX> from job opportunities in administration of public schools , adding that the government bans teaching any religious books in schools and universities that are not <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hanabali</ENAMEX> and does not present any <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shafii</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Maliki</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiite</ENAMEX> opinions as part of religious instruction .
It does not allow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="4" E_OFF="1">non-Hanabali</ENAMEX> clerics to teach their doctorines .
It pointed out that the government controls religious education and the public and private schools from basic through to the end of the university stages , where all the religious and history books are in accordance with the interpretation of the official doctorine .
It does not include any views of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunni</ENAMEX> sects and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiites</ENAMEX> in the textbooks .

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asaad</ENAMEX> , why do you specialize in copying everything that is against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> ?
Is this its reward for supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> people ?
Do you want her to rule with positivist law instead of God 's book ?
These people will not be satisfied with us until we follow their denomination .
God have mercy on him whose faults have distracted him from seeing the faults of others .
God grant success to all .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The Rejoicer</ENAMEX>
I wish that you were more logical , my dear brother ...
You downloaded the subject without reading as you mentioned , just because it is against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> .
I do not declare <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> free from wrong - doing ; it has faults like others and we wish they would be eradicated .
But it is not good , my dear brother , if these are your positions , especially as you post good articles about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> issue and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> ...
By doing this and quoting the buzzing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafida</ENAMEX> and others causes the fair reader to react to the issues that you bring up and the subjects which you raise , and this reflects negatively on the subjects of beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> ..
By doing this you are transmitting an aversion , which you might not feel ; and aversion between all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> .
The word is integrity .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asaad</ENAMEX>
Upon you be peace and the mercy of God .
I download everything I find before me about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Al - Quds Al - Arabi</ENAMEX> newspaper which is blocked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> internet , because the overwhelming majority of the readers of the forum are <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> and they have the right to read .
So far the number of those who read this article has exceeded <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1600</ENAMEX> people .
You must not get upset about the copying of these articles , because you have the right to read those who praise you and those who curse you .
My position on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> is well - known , I have written praising it for its position towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> people and their prime minister a number of times .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sultan al - Hakr</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asaad</ENAMEX> : you specialize in defending the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafida</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> and other places .
Look at the evidence from your article , " as well as the repression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Ismaili</ENAMEX> minorities , "
" It added that reports estimate <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an approximate 6 thousand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiite</ENAMEX> citizens from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Eastern Region</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Medina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Najran</ENAMEX> are banned from leaving the country .
Passports are being confiscated without a court order and there are many reasons for confiscation - from traveling to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> to other unknown reasons . "
" The report indicated that the basic governance system does not recognize the right to peaceful assembly , considering that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> regime puts all kinds of difficulties in the way of the religious , cultural and educational activities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiites</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> . "
This is also <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of your articles which you copied to defame those you call <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Wahabis</ENAMEX>
http://alsaha.fares.net/sahat?128@91.sd1NcTEBAaa.32@.3ba99db5 .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asaad</ENAMEX> : The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shia</ENAMEX> must submit to the constitution of the state in which they live and our constitution is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Islam</ENAMEX> .
To write to me : http://sultan5.arabform.com
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The one taking refuge in God</ENAMEX>
I have been following your writings for a while , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asaad</ENAMEX> ..
And whenever I wanted to write a reply , I change my mind ..
I want to know why most of your contributions are about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> only ?
As regards what you said about the reason for your copying of this news in your reply no. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudis</ENAMEX> and others can access this newspaper .. this is not a main and convincing reason .
I thank my brother , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rejoicer</ENAMEX> , for his reply , he wrote what was on my mind .
-LRB- Fear God wherever you may be -RRB- .
It is very easy for us to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Islam</ENAMEX> , but it is very difficult for us to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Islam</ENAMEX> .

"
So according to you , you have opened us a window for fresh air ?
Brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asaad</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atwan</ENAMEX> 's newspaper is contaminated so be careful against continually passing on the anthrax disease , The jar wo n't survive each drop . Even if you were its correspondent and distributor , and of the articles of the mercenary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed Al - Masri</ENAMEX> specifically .
It is also a nest of the haters from amongst the collaborators and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Khwarij</ENAMEX> who are being directed by hostile parties who do not want anything good for this country and its people .
We continually ask : what does <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> , the instigator of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Balfour Declaration</ENAMEX> , benefit from hosting to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atwan</ENAMEX> ?
What are his supernatural abilities that enable him to spend on his wretched newspaper , the circulation of which does not cover the cost of the ink !? Together with the costs of his accommodation , insurance , children and car .
It would be nice if you supplied us with a fiery article by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atwan</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair 's</ENAMEX> statements on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , which say that the war there is a sectarian war .
Man .. the likes of him who live in a country that gave away his homeland to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jews</ENAMEX> ; this is the lowest degree of expressing loathing .
Our Lord ! Give us mercy from Thy presence , and shape for us right conduct in our plight ..
