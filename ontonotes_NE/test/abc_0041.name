The shock waves rushed across the country .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> campaign had steeled themselves to lose , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and his team were convinced <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Florida Supreme Court</ENAMEX> were determined to win this one for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's lawyers are rushing to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court of the United States</ENAMEX> for assistance .
There was no major reaction on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wall Street</ENAMEX> .
Markets had closed .
Everywhere else in the country , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> were stopped momentarily in their tracks to think of the mess that may lie ahead .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> question , how can <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> count the votes in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</ENAMEX> counties when it took this much to get a partial count in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> ?
Let 's go back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erin Hayes</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> , here in the capital they are just about ready to go .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tallahassee</ENAMEX> in a courthouse , , 000 votes from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami - Dade County</ENAMEX> .
Those votes there had been preparations just in case .
If we use <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</ENAMEX> teams , then that roughly adds up to little less than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> ballots per team , and we figure we could probably conclude that within <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">an eight - hour time</ENAMEX> .
But then , for the rest of the state , some counties have n't separated the undervotes from the rest of the ballots .
Where to start ? and what to count ?
There was almost no guidance from the court on how to do it .
In tabulating what constitutes a legal vote , the standard to be used is the one provided by the legislature .
A vote shall be counted where there is a clear indication of the intent of the voter .
Exactly the kind of ambiguity that has kept the legal battle muddy and ongoing for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">31 days</ENAMEX> .
We do n't know what the standards will be .
We do n't know who will count them .
We do n't know whether or not she will be counted in time for them to count in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Electoral College</ENAMEX> .
The court was deeply divided .
Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wells</ENAMEX> said -- the concern among many is that this decision now leads so many questions .
T. would appear very little time to find the answers .
Thanks .
