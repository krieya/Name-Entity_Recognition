<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> strongly denied playing any role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> stock - price free fall .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Makoto Utsumi</ENAMEX> , vice minister for international affairs , said the ministry did n't in any way suggest to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks that they stay out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> leveraged buy - out .
The ministry has never even suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks be cautious about leveraged buy - outs in general , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utsumi</ENAMEX> said .
`` There are no facts -LCB- behind the assertions -RCB- that we sent any kind of signal , '' he declared in an interview .
The comments were the ministry 's first detailed public statement on the subject , and reflect the ministry 's concern that foreigners will think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets .
A number of accounts of the events leading to the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</ENAMEX> point drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> stock prices on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 13</ENAMEX> accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL</ENAMEX> deal for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> reason or another .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utsumi</ENAMEX> said the most the ministry had ever done was ask <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks about `` the status of their participation '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> previous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> leveraged buy - out .
The ministry inquired about that deal -- which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utsumi</ENAMEX> declined to identify -- because the large presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks in the deal was `` being strongly criticized in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> '' and it was `` necessary for us to grasp the situation . ''
He said the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation , and he added that none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utsumi</ENAMEX> also said some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks were willing to participate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL</ENAMEX> financing up to the very end , which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under orders to back out .
In general , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utsumi</ENAMEX> said , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks are becoming more `` independent '' in their approach to overseas deals .
`` Each <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that -LCB- UAL -RCB- deal , '' he said .
`` They are becoming more independent .
It 's a sound phenomenon . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sanwa Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> bank that decided not to participate in the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL</ENAMEX> proposal .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sanwa Bank</ENAMEX> spokesman denied that the finance ministry played any part in the bank 's decision .
`` We made our own decision , '' he said .
Still , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utsumi</ENAMEX> may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in orchestrating recent moves by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">All week</ENAMEX> there has been much speculation in financial circles in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and abroad about the ministry 's real position .
Bank analysts say ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few months</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks getting in over their heads .
`` The -LCB- ministry -RCB- thinks the banks do n't know what they are doing , that they have very little idea how to cope with risk , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> foreign bank analyst who asked not to be identified .
`` The -LCB- ministry -RCB- wants to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks pull in their horns '' on leveraged buy - outs , he added .
Although some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> proposed bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL</ENAMEX> bowed out because they found the terms unattractive , observers here say they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks are under `` political pressure '' as well , the analyst said .
Moreover , analysts point out that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if they offer the chance to build market share , cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats .
Clearly , some financial authorities are concerned about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks role in leveraged buy - outs .
At a news conference <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satoshi Sumita</ENAMEX> cautioned banks to take a `` prudent '' stance regarding highly leveraged deals .
Despite Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sumita</ENAMEX> 's statements , it is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> , not the central bank , that makes policy decisions .
While recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy - out fever , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks are n't likely to walk away from the game .
Despite the risks , the deals can be an attractive way for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks to increase their presence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> market , bank analysts say .
Flush with cash at home , but with fewer customers to lend to , leading banks are eager to expand overseas .
Jumping in on big deals is a high profile way to leapfrog the problem of not having a strong retail - banking network .
