<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford Motor Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> , the company 's first new car franchise in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Edsel</ENAMEX> was unveiled in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1957</ENAMEX> , now will share <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Edsel</ENAMEX> 's fate .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> it will halt imports of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scorpio</ENAMEX> , a $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">28,000</ENAMEX> luxury sedan built by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford of Europe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
The cars are sold under a separate franchise with its own sign in front of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lincoln - Mercury</ENAMEX> dealers -- as opposed to new models such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Taurus</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Escort</ENAMEX> , which are sold under existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> divisions .
The move to halt imports -- announced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">29 years</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">11 months to the day</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Ford II</ENAMEX> declared that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Edsel</ENAMEX> division and its gawky car would be scrapped -- kills the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - year - old</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> brand in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> market .
It will continue to be sold in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> 's death is n't nearly as costly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> as was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Edsel</ENAMEX> debacle , because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> was a relatively low - budget project with limited sales goals .
Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> 's demise is a setback for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> at a time when the company 's image as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto maker with the golden touch is showing signs of strain .
The No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> auto maker 's new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thunderbird</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mercury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cougar</ENAMEX> models have n't met sales expectations in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year since they were introduced</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> 's trucks are losing ground to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> rivals .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This fall</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</ENAMEX> new product : A restyled version of its hulking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lincoln</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town Car</ENAMEX> luxury model .
The demise of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> -LRB- pronounced mare - COOR -RRB- comes after a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">670</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> dealers managed to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 93</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scorpios</ENAMEX> .
Total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> sales for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first nine months</ENAMEX> dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 6,320</ENAMEX> cars .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> is n't the only <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> luxury brand having problems in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> assault on the luxury market is rapidly overshadowing such <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> makes as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Audi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saab</ENAMEX> , which at least have clear brand images .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> , as an import on domestic car lots , suffered from the same sort of image confusion that is hobbling sales of imports at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler Corp</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> was originally aimed at enticing into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lincoln - Mercury</ENAMEX> dealerships the kind of young , affluent buyers who would n't be caught dead in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">a Town Car --</ENAMEX> a vehicle so bargelike that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> is staging a press event <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</ENAMEX> linking <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the Town Car 's</ENAMEX> launch to the commissioning of a new aircraft carrier in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norfolk</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va</ENAMEX> .
But the brand had trouble from the start .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">XR4Ti</ENAMEX> , went on sale in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1985</ENAMEX> .
The sporty coupe foundered in part because <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> buyers did n't go for the car 's unusual double - wing rear spoiler .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1987</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> began importing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scorpio</ENAMEX> sedan from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> to sell next to a redesigned <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">XR4Ti</ENAMEX> in showrooms .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> officials said they expected the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkurs</ENAMEX> would sell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 15,000</ENAMEX> cars a year , and in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> they reached that goal , as sales hit <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,261</ENAMEX> cars .
It was downhill from there , however .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> major factor was the decline of the dollar against the mark , which began <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">less than a year</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> launch .
As the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> currency rose , so did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> prices .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merkur</ENAMEX> cars also suffered from spotty quality , some dealers say .
`` It was like a comedy of errors , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin J. `` Hoot '' McInerney</ENAMEX> , a big dealer whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Star Lincoln - Mercury - Merkur</ENAMEX> operation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Southfield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , sold more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT" E_OFF="2">XR4Ti's</ENAMEX> than any other dealership .
But by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third quarter of 1988</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scorpios</ENAMEX> had a high satisfaction rating in internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> studies , a spokesman said .
Apparently , however , the improvement came too late .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last fall</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> announced it would discontinue the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">XR4Ti</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 1989 model year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> said then it would keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scorpio</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scorpio</ENAMEX> sales plummeted , and at the current sales pace it would take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">242</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">days</ENAMEX> to sell off the current <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scorpio</ENAMEX> inventory of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 4,600</ENAMEX> cars .
