The stock market correction of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 13 , 1989</ENAMEX> , was a grim reminder of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Oct. 19 , 1987 market collapse</ENAMEX> .
Since , like earthquakes , stock market disturbances will always be with us , it is prudent to take all possible precautions against another such market collapse .
In general , markets function well and adjust smoothly to changing economic and financial circumstances .
But there are times when they seize up , and panicky sellers can not find buyers .
That 's just what happened in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1987</ENAMEX> crash .
As the market tumbled , disorderly market conditions prevailed : The margins between buying bids and selling bids widened ; trading in many stocks was suspended ; orders took unduly long to be executed ; and many specialists stopped trading altogether .
These failures in turn contributed to the fall in the market averages : Uncertainty extracted an extra risk premium and margin - calls triggered additional selling pressures .
The situation was like that of a skier who is thrown slightly off balance by an unexpected bump on the slope .
His skis spread farther and farther apart -- just as buy - sell spreads widen during a financial panic -- and soon he is out of control .
Unable to stop his accelerating descent , he crashes .
After the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash , and as a result of the recommendations of many studies , `` circuit breakers '' were devised to allow market participants to regroup and restore orderly market conditions .
It 's doubtful , though , whether circuit breakers do any real good .
In the additional time they provide even more order imbalances might pile up , as would - be sellers finally get their broker on the phone .
Instead , an appropriate institution should be charged with the job of preventing chaos in the market : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> .
The availability of timely assistance -- of a backstop -- can help markets retain their resilience .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> already buys and sells foreign exchange to prevent disorderly conditions in foreign - exchange markets .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> has assumed a similar responsibility in the market for government securities .
The stock market is the only major market without a market - maker of unchallenged liquidity or a buyer of last resort .
This does not mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> does not already play an important indirect role in the stock market .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , it pumped <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</ENAMEX> into the markets through open market operations and the discount window .
It lent money to banks and encouraged them to make funds available to brokerage houses .
They , in turn , lent money to their customers -- who were supposed to recognize the opportunity to make a profit in the turmoil and buy shares .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> also has the power to set margin requirements .
But would n't it be more efficient and effective to supply such support to the stock market directly ?
Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity , and thereby increasing the danger of inflation , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market , thus stabilizing the market as a whole .
The stock market is certainly not too big for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> to handle .
The foreign - exchange and government securities markets are vastly larger .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Daily</ENAMEX> trading volume in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> foreign exchange market is <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 130 billion</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> volume for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> Securities is <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 110 billion</ENAMEX> .
The combined value of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> equity trading on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Exchange</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASDAQ</ENAMEX> over - the - counter market ranges <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 7 billion and $ 10 billion</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13 billion</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> injected into the money markets after the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash is more than enough to buy all the stocks traded on a typical day .
More carefully targeted intervention might actually reduce the need for government action .
And taking more direct action has the advantage of avoiding sharp increases in the money supply , such as happened in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1987</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> 's stock market role ought not to be very ambitious .
It should seek only to maintain the functioning of markets -- not to prop up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> averages at a particular level .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> should guard against systemic risk , but not against the risks inherent in individual stocks .
It would be inappropriate for the government or the central bank to buy or sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Motors</ENAMEX> shares .
Instead , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> could buy the broad market composites in the futures market .
The increased demand would normalize trading and stabilize prices .
Stabilizing the derivative markets would tend to stabilize the primary market .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> would eliminate the cause of the potential panic rather than attempting to treat the symptom -- the liquidity of the banks .
Disorderly market conditions could be observed quite frequently in foreign exchange markets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1960s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1970s</ENAMEX> .
But since the member countries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> agreed to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the `` Guidelines to Floating ''</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</ENAMEX> , such difficulties have been avoided .
I can not recall any disorder in currency markets since the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</ENAMEX> guidelines were adopted .
Thus , the mere existence of a market - stabilizing agency helps to avoid panic in emergencies .
The old saying advises : `` If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . ''
But this could be a case where we all might go broke if it is n't fixed .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heller</ENAMEX> , now at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VISA International</ENAMEX> , was a governor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> .
This is adapted from a speech to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commonwealth Club</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
