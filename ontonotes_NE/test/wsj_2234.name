A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and on all flights of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</ENAMEX> or less to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> .
The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic , and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</ENAMEX> or less .
The exemption allowed on longer flights to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> appears to be largely a face - saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
By a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</ENAMEX> - 4 margin , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> negotiators initially rejected <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> provision covering all domestic flights .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">six - hour</ENAMEX> compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions .
As a practical matter , flights from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the West Coast</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> would be covered as they are under the time limit , but the language would exempt longer routes beginning , for example , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> or on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the East Coast</ENAMEX> .
Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> , the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lautenberg</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , who has used his position as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate Appropriations</ENAMEX> subcommittee chairman to garner votes for the initiative .
The measure is attached to the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 26 billion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> transportation bill within Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lautenberg</ENAMEX> 's jurisdiction , and the final compromise is laced with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 205 million</ENAMEX> in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> .
From the outset , the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow .
But the industry retains support in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> leadership through the influence of grower states , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> .
Majority Whip <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Gray</ENAMEX> owes a political debt to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Southern</ENAMEX> agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban .
Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of behind - the - scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane , but politically important , projects of members .
In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> who had voted against the panel leadership on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> floor .
`` Anybody can vote as they want , '' said Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lehman</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fla.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> conferees .
`` But if you make a request , you should support the committee . ''
Within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> , the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , and total operations would rise to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.84 billion</ENAMEX> -- a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</ENAMEX> boost .
The facilities account includes <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> 's ambitious new airport , and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> and the major carriers to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Continental</ENAMEX> .
Leery of the costs -- and , critics say , competition -- the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Air Corp.</ENAMEX> , which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Continental</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Air Transport Association</ENAMEX> were prominent in the lobbying .
The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> and the airlines had agreed to leases for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> of the gates .
But this was rejected in favor of much looser language directing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Transportation Department</ENAMEX> to review the costs of the first phase , expected to cost <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2 billion</ENAMEX> .
Though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed to preserve <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 30.6 million</ENAMEX> in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports .
The sum is more than double what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> had approved for the program , but the list of qualified airports would be cut by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</ENAMEX> under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> previously cut <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> airports <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
The impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 200</ENAMEX> for each passenger in subsidies .
Among rail and highway accounts , the agreement provides <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 615 million</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Amtrak</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 85 million</ENAMEX> for capital improvements .
And federal - formula grants for mass transit would be effectively frozen at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.625 billion</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</ENAMEX> more than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last fiscal year</ENAMEX> .
