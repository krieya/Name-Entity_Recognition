Good <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> is bringing most of its investigators home from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> .
Things have not gone quite as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> had hoped .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly 200</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> agents went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> right after the attack on the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> . ''
A very high profile investigation in a very tense part of the world .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemenis</ENAMEX> are worried about the threat to their national sovereignty .
We got our closest look at the damage to the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> '' today , but even as we did , and even as the Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> thanked the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemenis</ENAMEX> for their early cooporation , investigators in the field think they have hit a brick wall .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Miller</ENAMEX> reports <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> from the port city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> agents moved out in a caravan of trucks and buses , with all their gear in tow .
They are leaving frustrated .
The majority are going home , some will stay on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tarawa</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> ship offshore .
Sources tell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC News</ENAMEX> the agents are moving out because of security concerns , but mostly because the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> government is not allowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> to do what it came here to do .
While there has been a great deal of talk about the high level of cooperation between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> investigators and their <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> counterparts , in this investigation , there is a growing level of frustration on the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials , because even now , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</ENAMEX> into the case , no <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> agent has been given independent access to interview any of the witnesses or suspects .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> was allowed to visit suspected safe houses and collect evidence and fingerprints , but only after <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> investigators had been through the houses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> ambassador and a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> official met with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ally Saleh</ENAMEX> to complain that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> investigators were not sharing leads or information .
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> are concerned about sharing information that could be embarrassing to a country that has been called a haven for terrorists , but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials say without access to the witnesses here , the future of any <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> prosecution for the murder of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> sailors is in doubt .
