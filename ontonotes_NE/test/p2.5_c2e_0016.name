In the past , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's wealth was entirely state assets or collective assets .
It all belonged to the ordinary people .
In other words , when the " elite " first began to clamor for " reform " , wealth was in the hands of the ordinary people and " reform " was in the hands of the " elite . "
After reforms here and reforms there , the outcome was that wealth had fled into the hands of the " elite " and the foreigners .
The ordinary people were left only with " reform " , while the " elite " who constituted less than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> of China held more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 %</ENAMEX> of the wealth .
No matter how the " elite " sugarcoated it , the fact was still a fact .
First - hand experience is more authoritative than any smooth talk .
As long as an ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> 's IQ is not the same as that of the house dogs of the jet set , they can not possibly remained indifferent when faced with such reality .
If the " elite " want the ordinary people to have no opinion or bitterness over this , depriving the ordinary people of their " right of speech " would be useless , using " entitlement theory " to deprive the ordinary people of their right to thought would be useless , and " revealing the dagger at the end " by using politics , violence and suppression would be even more useless .
Reckoning all the options , it seems that the only thing to do is to eliminate the ordinary people 's ability to perceive , causing the ordinary people to have absolutely no consciousness of any of the suffering .
This might have solved the problem -- of course , this is the elite 's " most ideal " solution .
As long as this day dream is n't realized , ordinary people will inevitably have their own assessment of all the facts , and it is unlikely that the " reforms " of the " elite " wo n't have a stink about them in the minds of ordinary people .
It was n't that anybody had used language to give reform a " stink " , but that the " elite " had used action themselves to make themselves " stink " and make their " reform " stink .
