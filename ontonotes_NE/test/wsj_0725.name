<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Ramirez</ENAMEX> and his men are late .
They pile out of their truck and furiously begin twisting together steel pipes linking a giant storage tank to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sharpshooter</ENAMEX> , a freshly drilled oil well <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two miles</ENAMEX> deep .
If they finish <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sharpshooter</ENAMEX> can pump <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> roustabout , hanging by his hands from a ladder , bounces his weight on a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three - foot</ENAMEX> wrench to loosen a stuck fitting .
`` We 've been putting in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">long hours</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramirez</ENAMEX> says -- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - day weeks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">13 - hour</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">days</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two months</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A year ago</ENAMEX> , when almost nothing was happening amid these desolate dunes , `` you 'd spend <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</ENAMEX> working and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</ENAMEX> in the yard , '' he recalls .
After a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - year</ENAMEX> nightmare of uncertain oil prices , draconian budget cuts and sweeping layoffs , fear is finally leaving the oil patch .
Independent drillers are gingerly sinking bits into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> 's crust again .
Some in Big Oil are easing the grip on their wallets .
Investment capital is creeping back , and oil properties are fetching more .
Oil - tool prices are even edging up .
What happened ?
In broadest terms , stability has quietly settled into international oil markets .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mideast</ENAMEX> politics have calmed down and the squabbling within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</ENAMEX> seems under control for now .
`` The fundamentals of supply and demand once again are setting oil prices , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Burk</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Arthur Andersen -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> oil expert .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> of wild swings , oil prices over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 12 months</ENAMEX> have settled at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 15 to $ 20</ENAMEX> a barrel .
That is n't the $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">40</ENAMEX> that delighted producers <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade ago</ENAMEX> or the $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</ENAMEX> that pleased users <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</ENAMEX> .
But it is high enough to prod the search for future supplies , low enough to promote consumption and , most important , steady enough for both producers and users to believe in .
Not that oil suddenly is a sure thing again .
The current equilibrium is fragile and depends on steady , strong demand and continued relative harmony within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OPEC</ENAMEX> , producer of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 40 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="4">non-Communist</ENAMEX> world 's crude .
A recession or new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OPEC</ENAMEX> blowup could put oil markets right back in the soup .
Also , the new stirrings are faint , and some question their extent .
Drilling activity is still far below <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years ago</ENAMEX> , there 's no hiring surge and some companies continue to shrink .
With all this , even the most wary oil men agree something has changed .
`` It does n't appear to be getting worse .
That in itself has got to cause people to feel a little more optimistic , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Cox</ENAMEX> , the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Phillips Petroleum Co</ENAMEX> .
Though modest , the change reaches beyond the oil patch , too .
The same roller - coaster prices that halted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> oil exploration and drove many veteran oil men and companies out of the business also played havoc with the nation 's inflation rate , the trade deficit and oil users ' corporate and personal budgets .
Now , at least some predictability has returned , for everyone from economists to motorists .
Corporate planners can plan again .
`` Management does n't want surprises , '' notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Zaves</ENAMEX> , who , as fuel - services director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Airlines</ENAMEX> , buys <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 2.4 billion gallons</ENAMEX> of jet fuel a year .
Prices had been so unstable that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zaves</ENAMEX> gave up on long - term forecasts .
And consumers `` should be comfortable , '' adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Henson Moore</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> deputy secretary of energy .
`` I do n't see anything on the horizon that could lead to a precipitous rise in the price . ''
The catalyst for all this has been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OPEC</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">About a year ago</ENAMEX> , it ended an on - again , off - again internal production war that had put prices on a roller coaster and pitched oil towns from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caracas</ENAMEX> into recession .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OPEC</ENAMEX> 's kingpin , abandoned a policy of flooding the market to punish quota - cheaters .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">About the same time</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> - Iraq war , which was roiling oil markets , ended .
In addition , global petroleum demand has been climbing .
It is projected to keep growing by <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a million barrels</ENAMEX> a day , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 2 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</ENAMEX> , for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> to come .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OPEC</ENAMEX> , that 's ideal .
The resulting firm prices and stability `` will allow both producers and consumers to plan confidently , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi Arabian</ENAMEX> Oil Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hisham Nazer</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OPEC</ENAMEX> Secretary - General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Subroto</ENAMEX> explains : Consumers offer security of markets , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OPEC</ENAMEX> provides security of supply .
`` This is an opportune time to find mutual ways -LCB- to prevent -RCB- price shocks from happening again , '' he says .
To promote this balance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OPEC</ENAMEX> now is finally confronting a long - simmering internal problem .
At its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> meeting , it will try to revise its quotas to satisfy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> members that can produce far more oil than their allotments .
Being held well below capacity greatly irritates them , and has led to widespread cheating .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OPEC</ENAMEX> has repeatedly raised its self - imposed production ceiling to legitimize some of that unauthorized output .
Oil ministers now hope to solve the issue for good through an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> proposal that gives a larger share of output to countries with surplus capacity and reduces the shares of those that ca n't produce more anyway .
But `` if they walk out without any effort to resolve their problem , production could increase to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 million</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 million barrels</ENAMEX> a day , making for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a very troublesome first quarter</ENAMEX> , '' warns <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nordine Ait - Laoussine</ENAMEX> , a consultant and former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Algerian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OPEC</ENAMEX> delegate .
That would send prices plummeting from what some gun - shy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> oil executives still regard as too low a level .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick J . Early</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Amoco Corp. 's</ENAMEX> oil - production unit , says that despite recent stability , he plans continued tightening of costs and exploration spending .
The view of some others in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Oil</ENAMEX> , he maintains , `` is very much -LCB- similar to -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Amoco</ENAMEX> 's outlook . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Just this week</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mobil Corp.</ENAMEX> disclosed new cutbacks in its domestic exploration and production operations .
Out here on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Querecho Plains</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> , however , the mood is more upbeat ; trucks rumble along the dusty roads and burly men in hard hats sweat and swear through the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</ENAMEX> sun .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Santa Fe Energy Co.</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Santa Fe Southern Pacific Co.</ENAMEX> , bought from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Amoco</ENAMEX> the rights that allowed it to drill the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sharpshooter</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">A mile and a half</ENAMEX> away looms the <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 - foot - tall</ENAMEX> rig of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sniper</ENAMEX> , due to be pumping by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> .
`` Talk is that everybody is going to drill more wells , '' says foreman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Folsom</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> aims to drill <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30</ENAMEX> wells in this area in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> and double that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
It is more aggressive than most , but it is n't the only company with a new attitude , as it found when it went looking for a partner for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sharpshooter</ENAMEX> .
`` We went to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> companies over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</ENAMEX> pitching the prospect , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Parker</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> exploration manager .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</ENAMEX> were interested . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitchell Energy -AMP- Development Corp.</ENAMEX> became the partner , ponying up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</ENAMEX> of the $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">600,000</ENAMEX> in drilling and start - up costs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitchell</ENAMEX> will get a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> - interest in the oil .
`` A kind of no - mistakes mentality '' had been stifling activity , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Covey</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitchell</ENAMEX> 's oil exploration chief .
Now `` everybody is a lot more optimistic . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> attraction for oil operators here and in other fields is the bargain - basement cost of drilling and equipment , reflecting service companies ' hunger for work .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kadane Oil Co.</ENAMEX> , a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> independent , is currently drilling <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> wells itself and putting money into <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> others .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of its wells , in southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> , is a `` rank wildcat , '' a risky well where oil previously has n't been found .
`` At this price , $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">18</ENAMEX> plus or minus , and with costs being significantly less than they were <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</ENAMEX> , the economics are pretty good , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Kadane</ENAMEX> , head of the company .
`` If you know you 've got stability in price , you can do things you would n't do with the volatility of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</ENAMEX> . ''
The activity is enough to move some oil - service prices back up a little .
Some drill - bit prices have risen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past month</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Gulf of Mexico</ENAMEX> , a boat to deliver supplies to offshore rigs now costs <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 3,000</ENAMEX> a day , up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 60 %</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> .
Some service boats recently were auctioned for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.7 million</ENAMEX> each , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 1 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> .
At the bottom of the slump , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Schlumberger Inc.</ENAMEX> was discounting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</ENAMEX> on an electronic evaluation of a well ; now it discounts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50 %</ENAMEX> , drillers say .
Still , there is money to be made .
Most oil companies , when they set exploration and production budgets for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , forecast revenue of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</ENAMEX> for each barrel of crude produced .
Prices have averaged <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 2</ENAMEX> a barrel higher than that -- not a windfall , but at least a pleasant bonus for them .
So , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dun -AMP- Bradstreet Corp.</ENAMEX> survey , companies that had been refusing to spend even their very conservative budgets may loosen up before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year end</ENAMEX> .
It says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> of those surveyed report that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> exploration spending will exceed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> 's .
Funds for drilling may inch up more <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> if oil prices stay stable .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texaco</ENAMEX> , thinking in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18 - to - $ 19</ENAMEX> oil for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> , may raise spending , especially for low - risk prospects , an official says .
Outside investors , scarce since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">'86</ENAMEX> , are edging back .
Although `` it 's still difficult to raise money for a pure wildcat program , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Thomas</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Commerce Bank</ENAMEX> official in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> , `` institutions are starting to see there are cycles to these things , and this one is beginning to turn . ''
Wall Street generally likes the industry again .
The appetite for oil - service stocks has been especially strong , although some got hit <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> cut its short - term investment ratings on them .
Contractors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parker Drilling Co.</ENAMEX> are raising cash again through stock offerings , and for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> oil - service companies recently went public .
-LRB- They are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grace Energy Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Marine Drilling Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
Most oil companies are still reluctant to add to the office and professional staffs they slashed so deeply .
But a few new spots are opening .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Arthur Andersen</ENAMEX> , the accounting firm , has increased its energy staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</ENAMEX> .
Out in the oil fields , if activity picks up much more , shortages could appear because so many roughnecks , roustabouts and others left after the crash .
Already `` it 's hard to get people .
They 're so busy , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> drilling foreman here .
For most field workers , it 's about time .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramirez</ENAMEX> , who arrived late at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sharpshooter</ENAMEX> with his crew because he had started <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</ENAMEX> setting up tanks at another site , just got the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> raise he can remember in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</ENAMEX> , to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.50</ENAMEX> an hour from $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">8</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Young</ENAMEX> , a `` mud - logger '' at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sniper</ENAMEX> well , has worked all but <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about nine days of this year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , `` I was off <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a straight month</ENAMEX> , then <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> time for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two to three weeks</ENAMEX> and another <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two to three weeks</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butch McCarty</ENAMEX> , who sells oil - field equipment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Davis Tool Co.</ENAMEX> , is also busy .
A native of the area , he is back now after riding the oil - field boom to the top , then surviving the bust running an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> convenience store .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> year I came back there was n't any work , '' he says .
`` I think it 's on the way back now .
But it wo n't be a boom again .
No major booms , no major setbacks , '' he predicts .
Business has been good enough that he just took a spur - of - the - moment <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</ENAMEX> trip to the mountain area of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Cloudcroft</ENAMEX> , something `` I have n't done in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> . ''
The figures confirm that there certainly is n't any drilling boom .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 14,505</ENAMEX> wells , including <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,900</ENAMEX> dry holes , were drilled for oil and natural gas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first nine months of the year</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.4 %</ENAMEX> from the like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> period .
But that was off less than at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">midyear</ENAMEX> , when completions lagged by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27.1 %</ENAMEX> .
And the number of rigs active in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> is inching up .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Baker Hughes Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">992</ENAMEX> rotary rigs were at work in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> , up from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year - ago</ENAMEX> count of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">933</ENAMEX> .
-LRB- In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> , before the bust , the rig count was above <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
Global offshore - rig use shows a similar upward trend .
Some equipment going to work is almost new .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grace Energy</ENAMEX> just <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ago</ENAMEX> hauled a rig here <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 miles</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caspar</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyo.</ENAMEX> , to drill the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bilbrey</ENAMEX> well , a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15,000 - foot</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 - million - plus</ENAMEX> natural gas well .
The rig was built around <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> , but has drilled <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</ENAMEX> wells , the last in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> .
Until now it had sat idle .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zel Herring</ENAMEX> , owner and a cook at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Sandhills Luncheon Cafe</ENAMEX> , a tin building in midtown , all this has made for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a very good year</ENAMEX> .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">11:30 a.m.</ENAMEX> or so `` we have them standing and waiting , '' she says , as she whips out orders for hamburgers and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> special -LRB- grilled roast beef , cheese and jalapeno pepper sandwich on whole wheat , potato salad , baked beans and pudding , plus coffee or iced tea .
Price : $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.50</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Huber</ENAMEX> , a roustabout , is even making it in his new career as an entrepreneur .
He started <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Arrow Roustabouts Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</ENAMEX> with a loan from a friend , since repaid , and now employs <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> .
He got <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> trucks and a backhoe cheap .
`` I want to add <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> more truck , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huber</ENAMEX> says .
I sense that it 's going to continue to grow .
That 's the word .
The word is out .
