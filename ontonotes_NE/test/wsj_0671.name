The municipal bond market is bracing for tough times through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</ENAMEX> as it struggles to absorb an oversupply of bonds and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of its best customers turn into sellers .
Commercial banks and property / casualty insurers , which together own <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 36 %</ENAMEX> of all municipal bonds , have been dumping their securities for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> , traders said , there were <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> institutional sellers for every buyer .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Every day</ENAMEX> we 're getting new bid lists '' from would - be sellers , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> trader said .
`` Most dealers can not continue to absorb this supply . ''
As a result , yields on long - term muni bonds now stand at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 95 %</ENAMEX> of long - term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> yields , the highest such level in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than two years</ENAMEX> .
`` There is incredible negative psychology building in the market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donna Avedisian</ENAMEX> , a vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch -AMP- Co</ENAMEX> .
`` People are very concerned about who is going to step up to the plate and buy municipal bonds in the absence of institutional buyers . ''
The yield on a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</ENAMEX> revenue bonds compiled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bond Buyer</ENAMEX> , a trade publication , now exceeds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.50 %</ENAMEX> .
At this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> bond sale , traders expect yields on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 - year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> bonds to nearly match the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.9 %</ENAMEX> yield on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds .
For an investor in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</ENAMEX> federal tax bracket , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.9 %</ENAMEX> tax - free is the same as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.38 %</ENAMEX> on a taxable investment .
That 's a taxable - equivalent yield <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly three</ENAMEX> percentage points more than the current yield on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds .
How quickly things change .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This past summer</ENAMEX> , investors ' appetite for municipal bonds seemed insatiable .
Individuals eager for tax - free income drove up bond prices , making state and local government debt one of the best - performing types of fixed - income investments during the period .
But while analysts say that municipal bonds still offer good value , you would n't know it by the way institutional investors are rushing to dump their holdings .
Bond market analysts say the institutional selling was triggered by several factors .
Big banks such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chase Manhattan</ENAMEX> , which have been taking heavy charges to expand their Third World loan - loss reserves , are n't looking for tax - exempt income .
`` We do n't need the shelter of tax - free bonds , '' said a spokeswoman at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</ENAMEX> , traders said , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical</ENAMEX> has sold <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 billion</ENAMEX> of tax - free bonds .
The spokeswoman confirmed that the bank has significantly reduced its muni holdings , but could n't immediately confirm the amount .
Insurance companies are rushing to sell before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</ENAMEX> , when some of their tax benefits associated with municipal bonds will be phased out .
There is speculation that property / casualty firms will sell even more munis as they scramble to raise cash to pay claims related to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northern California</ENAMEX> earthquake .
Fundamental factors are at work as well .
Muni bond holders are worried about the impact of a slowing economy on tax revenue , at a time when many state and local governments already face budget deficits and huge spending needs .
The recent natural disasters , and the need of many other cities to rebuild crumbling infrastructure , suggests that supply of new issues will continue to rise sharply -- even as demand tapers off .
`` There is just so much going on that it 's difficult to pick just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> factor that 's driving the market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Ian Heller</ENAMEX> , vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Chicago Capital Markets Inc.</ENAMEX> , a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Chicago Corp</ENAMEX> .
Some of the recent selling could actually be considered a positive sign .
Mutual funds , for example , are said to be selling existing municipal bonds to raise cash to buy new issues .
Because municipal bonds yields have risen at a time when interest rates generally have fallen , some portfolio managers are assuming that bonds bought now will appreciate in value as the municipal bond market rebounds .
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avedisian</ENAMEX> believes that the mutual funds are selling muni bonds that have a negative convexity -- those that have appreciated in price slowly relative to the decline in interest rates .
Such bonds , she says , are those that are nearing their call date .
But traders said the market 's tone could pick up <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 787 million</ENAMEX> bond offering goes well .
The offering will include <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 729 million</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 - year</ENAMEX> tax - exempt bonds and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 57.8 million</ENAMEX> of taxable bonds .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A few weeks ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> sold <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million</ENAMEX> of tax - exempts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> bonds have been beaten down for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three straight weeks</ENAMEX> .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , some issues fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly one</ENAMEX> point , or <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $ 10</ENAMEX> for each $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> face amount .
The sell - off in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> bonds was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health and political uncertainty in view of the impending mayoral election .
The city 's economy is growing weaker and expenditures are rising as tax revenue is falling .
`` The city has issued so much supply recently that some people are getting a little concerned .
They 'd like to see some other names in their portfolios , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael S. Appelbaum</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> .
But he thinks investors may be overreacting to the market 's problems .
Overall , he says , municipal prices are `` very cheap '' and represent an `` excellent buying opportunity . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's Market Activity
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds fell sharply on confusion about this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> debt auction and rumors that a major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investor was unloading large amounts of long - term bonds .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond ended at a price of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 2/32</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 5/8</ENAMEX> point from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 6.25</ENAMEX> for each $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> face amount .
The issue 's yield rose to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.93 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.88 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Late Thursday</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> said it needed to raise <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 billion</ENAMEX> quickly and would do so by issuing new securities <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> .
Credit market analysts expected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> to cancel <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - month</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> sale and to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 billion</ENAMEX> of cash management bills .
Instead , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> announced it would sell <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">51 - day</ENAMEX> cash management bills <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> and said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15.6 billion</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - month</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> bills will take place <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , as usual , but the sale will settle <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> .
By moving the settlement date ahead , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> can raise money under the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.87 trillion</ENAMEX> debt ceiling that is in effect through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> , after which it reverts to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.8 trillion</ENAMEX> .
The market also was hurt by rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> brokerage firm , was unloading some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bonds it recently purchased .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> dealer said the talk was that the firm sold <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 500 million</ENAMEX> of bellwether <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bonds .
The firm is thought to have purchased <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $ 3 billion</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bonds in a buying spree on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous Thursday</ENAMEX> .
Dealers say the firm apparently has wanted to publicize its recent buying and subsequent selling of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bonds by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> as a broker .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cantor</ENAMEX> provides price quotes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Telerate Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> , a widely used electronic system .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nippon Kangyo 's</ENAMEX> moves puzzled traders and created confusion among potential investors , many of whom decided to stay out of the market .
As a result of its large - scale buying , some analysts now say that liquidity , or the ability to easily buy and sell , has been constrained in the benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bond issue .
In other markets :
-- The junk bonds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX> rallied <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> on news that the company is selling its candy bar brands to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nestle Foods Corp.</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 370 million</ENAMEX> .
The sale price , which was above Wall Street expectations , sent many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RJR</ENAMEX> securities up by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> point .
`` It shows that there are buyers of high - quality assets at high prices in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Long</ENAMEX> , managing director and head of the high - yield research department at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Boston Corp</ENAMEX> .
Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RJR</ENAMEX> securities , which had been trading near their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">52 - week</ENAMEX> lows earlier in the session , bounced back after the company 's announcement that it agreed to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Baby Ruth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Butterfinger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> candy businesses to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nestle Foods</ENAMEX> , a unit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Swiss</ENAMEX> - based food concern .
The sale , expected to close before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</ENAMEX> , also includes a manufacturing plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Franklin Park</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ill</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RJR</ENAMEX> 's subordinated discount debentures of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</ENAMEX> , which traded as low as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , finished <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46 7/8</ENAMEX> .
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RJR</ENAMEX> securities also closed higher .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RJR Holdings Capital Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.7 %</ENAMEX> convertible pay - in - kind securities maturing in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2009</ENAMEX> closed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</ENAMEX> higher at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86 1/2</ENAMEX> after trading <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as low as 85 1/4</ENAMEX> .
Most other junk bond issues finished a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quarter</ENAMEX> - point lower on rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> was filing for protection from creditors under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Bankruptcy Code</ENAMEX> .
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campeau</ENAMEX> called the rumors `` ridiculous . ''
Most investment - grade bonds fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/8</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</ENAMEX> point .
-- Mortgage securities fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7/32 to 8/32</ENAMEX> but held up better than intermediate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasurys</ENAMEX> .
Dealers said some defensive investors were buyers of mortgages , as were dealers seeking collateral for REMICs priced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier last week</ENAMEX> .
Among major issues , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Government National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> securities for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> delivery ended at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 12/32</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8/32</ENAMEX> point for a yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9.35 %</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">12 - year</ENAMEX> average life assumption .
