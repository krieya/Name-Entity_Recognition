All over , a thousand sails compete in setting sail , a very lively scene .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fangchenggang</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qinzhou</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beihai</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhanjiang</ENAMEX> , people call the " Dragon 's head " of the southwest 's main passageway to the sea .

Construction of the main passage has activated the flow of materials , the flow of people and the flow of information in the great southwest , and has promoted development in the coastal port cities ' economies .
In order to meet the demands of rapid growth of goods and materials imports and exports in the great southwest , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> coastal cities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Northern Gulf</ENAMEX> have started a new upsurge of constructing ports .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">The Zhanjiang Port</ENAMEX> , which was the earliest built and is large - scale , now has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</ENAMEX> operating berths , among which <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</ENAMEX> are deep - water berths with a tonnage <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between 10,000 to 70,000 tons</ENAMEX> , and has an annual throughput reaching over <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 million tons</ENAMEX> .

It was followed by preparing to construct larger berths , No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</ENAMEX> and No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beihai</ENAMEX> has now completed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10,000 ton</ENAMEX> level docks and in the future another <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10,000 ton</ENAMEX> level berths will be put into reconstruction .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">The Qinzhou Port</ENAMEX> , which started relatively later , actively introduces a market mechanics to promote the development of the port , organizing big consortia and big companies from home and abroad to establish merchant groups to jointly invite businesses , and introduced an ownership system for reconstructing docks .
Currently , in the port development zone , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</ENAMEX> proprietary ports with tonnage capacities of over <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10,000 tons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</ENAMEX> proprietary storage projects are either under construction or preparing for construction .
After inspections , demonstrations and under the development zone 's uniform planning , proprietors from home and abroad choose their won projects , bring their own capital and sources of goods , manage their own business , and assume responsibility for profits and losses .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> port with proprietors as the main investment bodies will rise from here .

A number of traveling merchants from home and abroad , especially visionaries coming from the great southwest , have successively come to settle here to start processing industries that import large quantities and export large quantities .
The prospects are extremely good .
