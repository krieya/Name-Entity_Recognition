We have an update <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> on this , the volcano in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , they call <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">El Popo</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Just 24 hours</ENAMEX> after its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> erruption in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 1,000 years</ENAMEX> , the worst appears to be over , but there is still the possibility of great danger to the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</ENAMEX> of people who live nearby .
Our report on this <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Tibbles</ENAMEX> .
As the sun rises over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mt. Popo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> , the only hint of the fire storm inside , whiffs of smoke , but <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">just a few hours earlier</ENAMEX> , the volcano exploding spewing rock and red - hot lava .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> largest mountain in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">North American</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 18,000 feet</ENAMEX> high , erupting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> with its most violent outburst in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1200 years</ENAMEX> .
They say it is an especially dangerous volcano because it of its steep slopes .
It could potentially wipe out everything in its path .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</ENAMEX> people live in the path .
Here at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Natural Disaster Prevention Center</ENAMEX> , they are working around the clock .
It is here they take the volcano 's pulse , calling it unstable , saying <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Popo</ENAMEX> is simply recharging , getting ready to erupt again .
It 's acquiring more pressure , and eventually this pressure will be released in the -- in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the future days</ENAMEX> .
The danger ?
The heat from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Popo</ENAMEX> 's lava flow is melting the flashiers on the -- glaciers on the sides of the mountain and could trigger mud slides .
It 's like concrete coming down instead of water .
So , they will destroy anything in its -- that tries to stop them .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mexican</ENAMEX> government is taking no chances .
It sent out <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</ENAMEX> troops to force an evacuation inside an <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eight - mile</ENAMEX> radius .
Tonight , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</ENAMEX> people in shelters , but another <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</ENAMEX> refuse to leave , worried about their corn harvests who -- or who would feed their animals .
If a major danger was to come , says this man , then we 've got to run .
There 's no other choice .
Scientists say <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Popo</ENAMEX> has a huge crater <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about half a mile</ENAMEX> across , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 300 feet</ENAMEX> deep and a lava dome is building up like an upside - down grapefruit .
In contrast , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mt. Saint Helen</ENAMEX> had a dome , almost as if it was pregnant .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy White</ENAMEX> , who has done on - site studies of this mountain , monitors the rhythms .
It is blowing in its own way .
It could get bigger .
We do n't know how to predict it exactly .
For centuries here , the people have had almost a mystical relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Popo</ENAMEX> , believing the volcano is a god , showering their crops with rain .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Tonight</ENAMEX> , they fear it will turn vengeful , bringing destruction after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1200 years</ENAMEX> of peace .
