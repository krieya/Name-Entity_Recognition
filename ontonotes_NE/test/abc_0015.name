And now making hockey history --
the record for most victories by a goaltender in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Hockey League</ENAMEX> has been held by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Sawchuck</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Detroit Red Wings</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">since 1961</ENAMEX> , and now comes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Roy</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Colorado Avalanche</ENAMEX> .
Here 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Rooney</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">16 years</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Hockey League</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Roy</ENAMEX> has stopped the other team from scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21,000</ENAMEX> times , frequently doing the impossible .
Do you believe that ?
Highway robbery .
And the amazing thing is , he almost never sees the puck .
No , I do n't see the puck most of the time , especially when it 's really fast or at close range .
It 's more anticipating it .
He follows the action with his eyes , and just knows where the puck will go .
He plays what is known as butterfly style , splitting his legs , often playing from his knees , filling the net with his <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 ' 1 ''</ENAMEX> body .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 %</ENAMEX> of the time , when you 're coming down on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick</ENAMEX> , all you see is his big jersey and the equipment , and you just do n't see net , so there 's room to shoot .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy</ENAMEX> has his quirks .
He talks to the goalposts and refuses to step on the red and blue lines .
He writes the names of his <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> children on his stick before every game , but he says the most important thing is not superstition , not even talent .
I think the passion .
If you love what you 're doing , and if you 're a passionate person , I mean , that will make the difference in the end .
When he breaks the record for most wins , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Roy</ENAMEX> will replace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Detroit</ENAMEX> 's late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Sawchuk</ENAMEX> in the record books .
From <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Vezina</ENAMEX> in the to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gump Worsely</ENAMEX> , who had a face stitched like a quilt , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy</ENAMEX> 's hero , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogie Vachon</ENAMEX> , pioneer of an aggressive style , the goalie has been the loner of the end of the rink .
They used to play without a mask , but now the game is faster and the puck flies at <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 miles</ENAMEX> an hour .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Years ago</ENAMEX> , the goaltenders were kind of the guys that could n't play defense , could n't play forward , maybe were n't good skaters , so they put them in net .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , I think they 're as good an athlete as any other player on the team .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Roy</ENAMEX> has established a standard that the goalie has to be an athlete on a par with the best of any sport .
He has won <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Stanley Cup</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> times .
I just wanted to survive , you know .
I just wanted to break that league and survive in it as long as I could , and being in that position <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> is something big for me .
He loves to play , which is just another thing that might make him the greatest goalie the game has ever had .
