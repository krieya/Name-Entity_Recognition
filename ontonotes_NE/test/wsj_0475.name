<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern Airlines '</ENAMEX> creditors committee backed off a move to come up with its own alternative proposals to the carrier 's bankruptcy reorganization plans , according to sources familiar with the committee .
In a meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , the committee put on hold instructions it gave <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ago</ENAMEX> to its experts to explore other options for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's future , the sources said .
The consultants had been working to finish a report <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> .
That means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Air Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> , can go forward with its pitch for creditor approval <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as today</ENAMEX> , when it is expected to deliver a revised reorganization plan to the committee .
The committee intends to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> to make a recommendation on the new plan .
In another development <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , creditors were told that <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</ENAMEX> they had expected to become available for implementing a reorganization may not materialize , according to one source .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Air</ENAMEX> has run into difficulty reselling <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 20 million</ENAMEX> of debt securities because of problems in the junk bond market , the person said .
And plans to raise <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">another $ 20 million</ENAMEX> through changes to an insurance policy have hit a snag , the source said .
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> spokesman said `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</ENAMEX> will have no effect whatsoever on the asset structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's plan .
<ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty million</ENAMEX> in the total scheme of things is not that significant . ''
It is unclear what caused the creditors to do an about - face on exploring alternatives to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's new reorganization plan .
However , since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> first filed for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> protection <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March 9</ENAMEX> , it has consistently promised to pay creditors <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">100 cents</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</ENAMEX> .
Because the carrier is still pledging to do that , some committee members successfully argued that there 's little reason yet to explore a different plan , according to one person familiar with the creditors ' position .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this month</ENAMEX> the accounting firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ernst -AMP- Young</ENAMEX> and the securities firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Goldman , Sachs -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , the experts hired by the creditors , contended that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> would have difficulty meeting earnings targets the airline was projecting .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ernst -AMP- Young</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's plan would miss projections by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Goldman</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> would miss the same mark by at least <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 120 million</ENAMEX> .
The consultants maintained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> would n't generate the cash it needs and would have to issue new debt to meet its targets under the plan .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> at the time disputed those assessments and called the experts ' report `` completely off base . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Zweibel</ENAMEX> , an attorney for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's creditors committee , declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look at other choices and whether they <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">now</ENAMEX> were asked not to .
He said only that the committee has not yet taken any position on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's reorganization plan and that the two sides were still negotiating .
`` In every case , people would like to see a consentual plan , '' he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> and its creditors agreed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> on a reorganization plan that called for the carrier to sell off <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 billion</ENAMEX> in assets and to emerge from <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> status in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1989</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two - thirds</ENAMEX> its former size .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> eventually decided not to sell off a major chunk , its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South American</ENAMEX> routes , which were valued at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million</ENAMEX> .
Such a change meant the reorganization plan the creditors had agreed on was no longer valid , and the two sides had to begin negotiating again .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> has publicly stated it is exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and has predicted it would emerge from <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> proceedings <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early next year</ENAMEX> , operating more flights than it originally had scheduled .
