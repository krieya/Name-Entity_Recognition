Good <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</ENAMEX> , everyone .
We begin <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a couple</ENAMEX> of urgent questions for the government .
There 's a man on trial in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> for bombing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> embassy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> says when they questioned him , he told them of another plot to bomb an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> ship in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole ''</ENAMEX> was ultimately attacked .
Question <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> , did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> make it clear what the man had told them ?
Question <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> , did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> get the message and do nothing about it ?
Here 's your national correspondent , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John M Wethy</ENAMEX> .
In the days after the bombing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> embassy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nairobi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Al - owhali</ENAMEX> was arrested by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kenyan</ENAMEX> authorities and interrogated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> .
He told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> he participated in the attack under direction of terrorist leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama Bin Laden</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC News</ENAMEX> has learned he also provided details of a plan to attack an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> warship in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - owhali</ENAMEX> said it would be a rocket attack , conducted by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Laden</ENAMEX> terrorist cell , and it would come in the next few months .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">The next morning</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1998</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> sent out a classified message , under Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Freeh</ENAMEX> 's name , warning of a plot to attack a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX> ship in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> message went to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> agencies , and as a result , the visit of one <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> warship to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> was canceled .
The warning came as General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Zinni</ENAMEX> was finalizing an agreement for refueling ships in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> port of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> .
It apparently left no lasting impression .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zinni</ENAMEX> testifying after the attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole ''</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> never had a specific terrorist threat .
All the other ports that have been mentioned here that we should have considered as options have had specific threats .
So what happened to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> warning ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> officials say they never received it .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> officials say they did copy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> officials say they got the warning , but had no idea it the source was such a well - connected insider within <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Laden 's</ENAMEX> organization .
This raises a fundamental question -- if the message had been more clearly communicated and understood , would <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> lives have been saved ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John M Wethy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC News</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pentagon</ENAMEX> , still looking for answers .
