Your <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 26</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Politics -AMP- Policy</ENAMEX> '' article about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Bennett 's</ENAMEX> Emergency Drug Plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> gives the impression that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> has not been nor is actively involved .
This is not the case .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> is very supportive of and an active participant in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> 's initiative .
It was agreed at the outset of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Washington Drug Initiative</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> 's role would be to continue targeting the major drug traffickers through our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Drug Strategy</ENAMEX> .
Through these investigations we do not focus on the street drug user , but rather we target and attack major drug - trafficking organizations that control a large segment of the drug market .
The trial of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raful Edmond III</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Drug Enforcement Administration</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Metropolitan Police Department</ENAMEX> -LRB- MPD -RRB- .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> 's role is to complement the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> initiative through not only these major trafficking investigations , but also by providing a full range of services through various task forces and our contacts with local police squads handling drug - related crimes .
In fact , we have agents assigned full time to assist the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MPD</ENAMEX> in drug - related crimes such as homicide and other crimes of violence .
