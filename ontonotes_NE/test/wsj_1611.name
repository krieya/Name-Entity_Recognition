As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> brothers ' personal bankruptcy cases sputter into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">their second year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minpeco S.A.</ENAMEX> has proposed a deal to settle its huge claim against the troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> oil men .
But the plan only threatens to heighten the tension and confusion already surrounding the cases that were filed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1988</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Peruvian</ENAMEX> mineral concern 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 251 million</ENAMEX> claim stems from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> jury award in a case stemming from the brothers ' alleged attempts to corner the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979 - 80</ENAMEX> silver market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minpeco</ENAMEX> now says it is willing to settle for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $ 65.7 million</ENAMEX> from each brother , although the actual amount would probably be much less .
Although the proposal must be approved by federal Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold C. Abramson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Herbert Hunt</ENAMEX> has agreed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Peruvian</ENAMEX> mineral concern 's proposal .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Bunker Hunt</ENAMEX> is considering it , although his attorney says he wo n't do it if the proposal jeopardizes a tentative settlement he has reached with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> , which claims the brothers owe <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> in back taxes and is by far the biggest creditor in both cases .
The tentative agreement between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Bunker Hunt</ENAMEX> is awaiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Justice Department</ENAMEX> approval .
Under it , the former billionaire 's assets would be liquidated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> getting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</ENAMEX> of the proceeds and the rest being divided among other creditors , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minpeco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</ENAMEX> , which is seeking repayment of a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 36 million</ENAMEX> loan .
A similiar proposal has been made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Herbert Hunt</ENAMEX> case although he and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> are at odds over the size of the non-dischargable debt he would have to pay to the government from future earnings .
In both cases , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minpeco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> have been fighting ferociously over their shares of the pie .
With support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> has filed suit asking Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abramson</ENAMEX> to subordinate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minpeco</ENAMEX> 's claim to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturer Hanover</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minpeco</ENAMEX> has threatened a `` volcano '' of litigation if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ENAMEX> unit attempts to force such a plan through the court .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minpeco</ENAMEX> said it would n't pursue such litigation if its settlement plan in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Herbert Hunt</ENAMEX> case is approved by Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abramson</ENAMEX> , who will consider the proposal at a hearing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minpeco</ENAMEX> attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Gorman</ENAMEX> decribed the plan as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> step toward an overall settlement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Herbert Hunt</ENAMEX> case but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Ray</ENAMEX> , attorney for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> , called it `` silly '' and said he would fight it in court .
`` The thing is so fluid right now that there 's really no way to say what will happen , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justice Department</ENAMEX> attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grover Hartt III</ENAMEX> , who represents the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> in the case .
`` Developments like this are hard to predict .
