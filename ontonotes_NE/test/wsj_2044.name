A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - Senate conference approved an <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">estimated $ 67 billion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> spending bill that provides a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</ENAMEX> increase for space research and development and incorporates far - reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market .
The current ceiling on home loans insured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Housing Administration</ENAMEX> would be increased to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">124,875</ENAMEX> .
Separately , the bill gives authority to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration to facilitate the refinancing of federally subsidized loans for low - income and moderate - income homeowners .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> provision , affecting so - called <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">235</ENAMEX> mortgages , has met strong opposition from investment bankers represented by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Public Securities Association</ENAMEX> .
And a squad of influential former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> aides employed by the Wall Street firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> came to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Capitol</ENAMEX> in a vain attempt to strip the provision .
By an <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</ENAMEX> - 2 margin , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> negotiators voted to preserve the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">235</ENAMEX> mortgage refinancing plan , and despite powerful allies , the opposition found itself undercut by an unusual alliance of liberals and conservatives .
The government currently is subsidizing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 23,000</ENAMEX> loans <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above 11 %</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">235</ENAMEX> program , and however disruptive to private investors , the refinancing is expected to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 15 million</ENAMEX> in savings in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> .
This sum has been guarded jealously by appropriators anxious to offset spending elsewhere , and conservative Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Gramm</ENAMEX> cast the fight as a populist stand against monied interests .
`` We are stewards here , not of the mortgage companies , but the taxpayers , '' said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> .
The action came as the administration won final congressional approval of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 million</ENAMEX> in assistance for elections scheduled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February</ENAMEX> .
The bulk of the money would be funneled through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Endowment for Democracy</ENAMEX> , but the legislation is so vaguely written that it has been dogged by questions regarding the money 's true purpose and its ultimate destination .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> had refused <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Friday</ENAMEX> to invoke cloture and limit debate , but behind the bipartisan leadership , a solid majority took shape <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> and brushed aside amendments seeking to cut the total package or steer it away from direct aid to political parties .
Final approval -- on a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</ENAMEX> - 35 roll call -- was never in doubt , but the opposition drew an unusual mix of senators , including <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Helms</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Rudman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Glenn</ENAMEX> .
The money will be applied for voter registration and election monitoring , but <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</ENAMEX> is likely to go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Union Nacional Opositora</ENAMEX> party .
Critics warned such cash contributions may only undercut the opposition party 's standing , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> irony is that under <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> law a major portion of the opposition party 's funds must be shared with the government 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Electoral Council</ENAMEX> .
Within the appropriations conference <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 67 billion</ENAMEX> measure is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> largest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> domestic spending bills and covers a disparate collection of accounts for science , housing , veterans and the environment .
The decision to raise the ceiling on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FHA</ENAMEX> home loans still faces strong opposition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> .
But it is driven by the same fiscal pressures that have forced lawmakers to resort to various bookkeeping devices to juggle <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 1 billion</ENAMEX> in spending that would otherwise put the bill over budget .
These costs will complicate the budget picture in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1991</ENAMEX> , and the measure further commits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> to a set of costly projects , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> construction funds for the space station .
The station is promised <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 billion</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.36 billion</ENAMEX> provided for research and development in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX> , and the nation 's high - speed aerospace plane -- cut by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> -- could receive <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 60 million</ENAMEX> in new funds or transfers .
Similarly , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> agreed to add back <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 62 million</ENAMEX> to continue work on the advanced communications technology satellite , being developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Electric Co</ENAMEX> .
And while setting a statutory limit of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6 billion</ENAMEX> on the automated space probe , the conference appropriated <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</ENAMEX> for the start - up of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CRAF</ENAMEX> - Cassini mission , a successor to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Voyager</ENAMEX> space probe .
Among major domestic agencies , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX> stands to receive increases significantly beyond those sought by the administration , with pollution abatement and control accounts growing by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 829.9 million</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">An estimated $ 1.57 billion</ENAMEX> is separately allocated for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Science Foundation</ENAMEX> , and within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Housing and Urban Development Department</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 9.2 billion</ENAMEX> is provided for federally assisted housing , including an expanded effort to modernize public housing units that serve the poorest families .
To an unusual degree , the massive bill has become a vehicle for lawmakers to earmark funds for projects in home states .
While the practice was discouraged in the past , the conference agreement is laced with veterans ' hospitals , environmental projects and urban grants designated for specific communities .
The most striking example <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> may have been in community development funds , where the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> houses had separately approved a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</ENAMEX> projects valued at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</ENAMEX> , and the conference added <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> more valued at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 million</ENAMEX> to ostensibly preserve `` balance '' between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> 's conference agreement is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> major bill to emerge from negotiations <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> , as appropriators approved a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> transportation bill <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Monday</ENAMEX> that includes a sweeping ban on smoking on most domestic airline flights .
An exemption will remain for flights <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than six hours</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> , but estimates by the tobacco industry <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> indicate all but <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30</ENAMEX> flights would be covered .
Separately , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> conference report covering an <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18.4 billion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Postal Service</ENAMEX> bill was sent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> after passing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">383</ENAMEX> - 30 roll call <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
And after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</ENAMEX> of delay , the appropriations process is beginning to take some final shape .
Defense and foreign aid are the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> most critical areas remaining from the administration 's standpoint .
And among domestic programs , the most serious threat is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the District of Columbia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Department of Health and Human Services</ENAMEX> .
The same issue threatens to spill over to the foreign aid debate , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> also is threatening to veto any agreement that preserves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> - passed provisions renewing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> support for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations Fund for Population Activities</ENAMEX> .
In a sharply written letter , Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Obey</ENAMEX> , chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations , warned Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> that the result of his `` ultimatum '' could weaken efforts to accommodate the administration elsewhere .
`` As a result of your ultimatum , '' writes the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> , `` I guess there is no longer any point in taking administration views into account on other items in conference , inasmuch regardless of their resolution you apparently intend to veto this bill .
