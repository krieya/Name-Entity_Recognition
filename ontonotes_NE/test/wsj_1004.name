<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> said it agreed to let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Motorola Inc.</ENAMEX> participate in a semiconductor research project as part of its effort to bolster the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> semiconductor industry .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> , which made the announcement at the dedication of a research center here , said it invited many other companies to participate as well , including some from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kuehler</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> 's president , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> , which said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</ENAMEX> it was inviting companies to participate in some semiconductor work , has become far more open about its technology as it has tried to rally <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> industry to head off the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> , who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips .
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armonk</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , makes the bulk of the DRAMs it uses , it does n't make the equipment needed to produce those chips .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> worries that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> will take over that equipment market , too , unless <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> equipment makers healthy .
Failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> equipment makers , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> fears , would leave it dependent on many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> companies that compete with it in other parts of the market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> also said it expects to benefit from the expertise that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Motorola</ENAMEX> and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> already participates in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> industrywide effort to improve semiconductor - manufacturing techniques .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> said it expects industrywide efforts to become prevalent because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive .
A state - of - the - art plant cost <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1970s</ENAMEX> but costs <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> because the technology is so complex .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> said it expects the costs to continue climbing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> , which said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Motorola</ENAMEX> is paying just a nominal fee to cover the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">21 - month</ENAMEX> agreement , acknowledged some companies had turned down its invitation to join in .
But it said that was mainly because the project may not bear fruit until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1990s</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> said it thought more companies would become interested as the project progresses .
The project involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Motorola</ENAMEX> concerns a technique , called X-ray lithography , that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory chips .
Currently , chips are produced by shining light through a mask to produce an image on the chip , much as a camera produces an image on film .
But details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine , and the wavelengths of even ultraviolet light are long enough so that the images they draw may be too blurry -- much as someone using a wide paintbrush could produce a broad line but would have trouble painting a thin one .
X-rays , by contrast , travel straighter and can be focused more tightly than light .
X-rays have problems , too .
They can make the masks brittle and can pass through material they 're not supposed to .
But , assuming those problems can be overcome , they should allow for memory chips that could approach <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one billion bits</ENAMEX> of information -- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</ENAMEX> times as much as is contained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four - megabit</ENAMEX> chips that are just reaching the market and a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</ENAMEX> times what was possible in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1970s</ENAMEX> .
