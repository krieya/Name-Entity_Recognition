<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kaufman -AMP- Broad Home Corp.</ENAMEX> said it formed a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 53.4 million</ENAMEX> limited partnership subsidiary to buy land in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> suitable for residential development .
The partnership , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kaufman -AMP- Broad Land Development Venture Limited Partnership</ENAMEX> , is a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 - 50</ENAMEX> joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Heitman Advisory Corp.</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Heitman Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> , a real estate advisory , management and development company with offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kaufman -AMP- Broad</ENAMEX> , a home building company , declined to identify the institutional investors .
The land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development , and part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kaufman -AMP- Broad 's</ENAMEX> job will be to obtain such approvals .
The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which can result in sizable savings , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Karatz</ENAMEX> , president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kaufman -AMP- Broad</ENAMEX> .
`` There are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash .
Typically , developers option property , and then once they get the administrative approvals , they buy it , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karatz</ENAMEX> , adding that he believes the joint venture is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> of its kind .
`` We usually operate in that conservative manner . ''
By setting up the joint venture , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kaufman -AMP- Broad</ENAMEX> can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land , while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karatz</ENAMEX> said .
The company is putting up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10 %</ENAMEX> of the capital , although it is responsible for providing management , planning and processing services to the joint venture .
`` This is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the best ways to assure a pipeline of land to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karatz</ENAMEX> said .
