In addition to pointing out the commonly seen advantages of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Caucasians</ENAMEX> : steel , technologies , weapons , central and unified government , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Desmond</ENAMEX> especially stressed one little - known factor -- bacteria .
He said that when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Caucasians</ENAMEX> conquered the new continent , the bacteria on their bodies killed far more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indians</ENAMEX> than their weapons .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1519</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six hundred</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Spaniards</ENAMEX> landed on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mexico</ENAMEX> to conquer the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Aztec</ENAMEX> Empire with a population of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few millions</ENAMEX> .
They lost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">two thirds</ENAMEX> of their soldiers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> clash .
What gave them the decisive advantage was smallpox .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1520</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Spaniard</ENAMEX> infected the opponent with smallpox , killing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">half</ENAMEX> of the people in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Aztec</ENAMEX> Empire including its emperor .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1618</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty million</ENAMEX> people were reduced to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6 million</ENAMEX> due to the epidemic .
In the meantime , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indians</ENAMEX> lacked a kind of bacteria to effectively attack the opponent party .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Desmond</ENAMEX> did not attribute bacteria to the human species , but believed that they , together with steel , guns and cannons , directly or indirectly originated from farming .
