A national <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeklong</ENAMEX> terror drill began in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> and an industrial lot in the city . strewn with smashed cars , buses and other debris representing the hypothetical damage from a fan that sized radioactive dirty bomb .
The test designed to measure the responsiveness of emergency workers to a terrorist attack .
It 's been <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year and a half</ENAMEX> since a series of anthrax attacks killed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> people .
No one has ever been arrested in connection with that case and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> is considering draining a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> pond relating to evidence for those unsolved attacks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelli Arena</ENAMEX> reports .
Reporter :
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> 's interest in this state park in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> dates back to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last December</ENAMEX> .
Officials got a tip back then that someone may have dumped equipment into <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the park 's ponds .
Officials say they found the tip significant because the pond is about ten miles from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort Dietrick</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Army</ENAMEX> experimented with anthrax .
Agents searched the area <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</ENAMEX> times since then .
The mayor says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> is now considering draining <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the ponds .
The police chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dine</ENAMEX> is in regular contact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> .
There are a number of facets to this investigation .
It 's very , very significant .
After all , it is a murder investigation , multiple murder investigation , so I 'm sure there are a number of avenues that they 're looking into .
Reporter :
According to government sources , agents in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> found a large plastic enclosed container with large openings on the side .
Officials say there is no evidence connecting anything found in the park to anthrax or the anthrax attacks , nor is there any evidence linking any individual to the deadly anthrax letters .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> has said nothing publicly about anyone it may be investigating , but Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ashcroft</ENAMEX> did refer publicly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Hatfield</ENAMEX> , a former researcher as a person of interest .
He 's repeatedly proclaimed his innocence and the spokesman told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> --
Well , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> can drain <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Pacific Ocean</ENAMEX> but they wo n't find any evidence that he was involved with the attacks because he had nothing to do with the anthrax attacks at all .
Reporter :
Investigators involved in this case clearly frustrated .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months later</ENAMEX> , still not <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> single arrest for those attacks that killed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> people and sickened <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</ENAMEX> others .
LOU ?
Kelly , where does this investigation on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hatfield</ENAMEX> stand ?
I mean , we have rather -- I ca n't think of another case like it .
We 've got rather public statements by law enforcement officials saying that he is the suspect that they think he 's the guy and then we have denial and then we have this stuff .
It 's really -- really extraordinary .
Reporter :
Well , the Attorney General has been the only person that has even mentioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Hatfield 's</ENAMEX> name publicly and he called him a person of interest , not a suspect .
But --
