<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> is cutting `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Pat Sajak Show</ENAMEX> '' down to <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</ENAMEX> from its current <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> insisted the move was n't a setback for the program , which is the network 's first entry into the late - night talk show format since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</ENAMEX> .
`` I have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</ENAMEX> is the best way to it , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rod Perth</ENAMEX> , who was named vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">late night</ENAMEX> entertainment in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> .
`` This will raise the energy level of the show . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> will continue to program action - adventure shows to follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sajak</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS News</ENAMEX> will extend its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - hour</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nightwatch</ENAMEX> '' by <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</ENAMEX> and begin at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">1:30 a.m</ENAMEX> .
The show , despite a promising start , has slipped badly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> ratings as compiled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">A.C. Nielsen Co.</ENAMEX> , finishing far below `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tonight</ENAMEX> '' on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> , and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nightline</ENAMEX> '' on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC - TV</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capital Cities / ABC Inc</ENAMEX> .
Further fractioning the late - night audience is the addition of the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arsenio Hall Show</ENAMEX> , '' syndicated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paramount Communications Inc</ENAMEX> .
