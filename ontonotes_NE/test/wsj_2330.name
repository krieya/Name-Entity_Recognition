While corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their drought - induced peaks of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , wheat prices remain stubbornly high .
And they 're likely to stay that way for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> to come , analysts say .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing , even with many farmers planting more <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</ENAMEX> wheat <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> than last , tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> , the analysts say .
And if rain does n't fall soon across many of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Great Plains '</ENAMEX> wheat - growing areas , yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced , further squeezing supplies .
Also supporting prices are expectations that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> will place substantial buying orders over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few months</ENAMEX> .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next May 31</ENAMEX> , stocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> wheat to be carried over into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next season</ENAMEX> -- before the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</ENAMEX> wheat now being planted is harvested -- are projected to drop to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">443 million bushels</ENAMEX> .
That would be the lowest level since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1970s</ENAMEX> .
Stocks were <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">698 million bushels</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May 31 of this year</ENAMEX> .
In response to dwindling domestic supplies , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Agriculture</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clayton Yeutter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> and still qualify for federal support payments .
The government estimates that the new plan will boost production <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 66 million bushels</ENAMEX> .
It now estimates production for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just under 2.6 billion bushels</ENAMEX> , compared with this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> 's estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.04 billion</ENAMEX> and a drought - stunted <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.81 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> .
But the full effect on prices of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</ENAMEX> wheat now being planted wo n't be felt until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half of next year</ENAMEX> .
Until then , limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4</ENAMEX> - a - bushel level , analysts say .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , wheat for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> delivery settled at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.0675</ENAMEX> a bushel , unchanged .
In theory at least , tight supplies <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next spring</ENAMEX> could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply - demand squeeze , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Basse</ENAMEX> , a futures analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AgResource Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
Such a situation can wreak havoc , as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBOT</ENAMEX> ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p . A.</ENAMEX> to liquidate futures positions equal to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 23 million bushels</ENAMEX> of soybeans .
The exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Italian</ENAMEX> conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ferruzzi</ENAMEX> has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market .
Unseasonably hot , dry weather across large portions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Great Plains</ENAMEX> and in wheat - growing areas in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> is threatening to reduce the yield from this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">season</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</ENAMEX> wheat crop , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conrad Leslie</ENAMEX> , a futures analyst and head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Leslie Analytical</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
For example , in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> panhandle , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> or more of the topsoil is short of moisture .
That figure climbs to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 47 %</ENAMEX> in wheat - growing portions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> , he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Soviet Union</ENAMEX> has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans , but many analysts expect <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> to place sizable orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> wheat in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few months</ENAMEX> , further supporting prices .
`` Wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> demand '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">coming weeks</ENAMEX> , predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Feltes</ENAMEX> , vice president , research , for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Refco Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
Looking ahead to other commodity markets <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> :
Orange Juice Traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> will go .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Late Thursday</ENAMEX> , after the close of trading , the market received what would normally have been a bullish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Department of Agriculture</ENAMEX> estimate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989 - 90</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> orange crop .
It was near the low range of estimates , at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90 - pound</ENAMEX> boxes , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">146.6 million</ENAMEX> boxes <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last season</ENAMEX> .
However , as expected , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.34</ENAMEX> a pound from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 1.55</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> report might have had and sent the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> orange juice contract down <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as 6.55 cents</ENAMEX> a pound at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> time .
It settled with a loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.95 cents</ENAMEX> at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.3210</ENAMEX> a pound .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Brazilian</ENAMEX> juice , after a delay caused by drought at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of its crop season</ENAMEX> , is beginning to arrive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> in large quantities .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> wants to stimulate demand for its product , which is going to be in plentiful supply .
The price cut , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> analyst said , appeared to be aimed even more at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , where consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Brazilian</ENAMEX> juice has fallen .
It 's a dollar - priced product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , the analyst said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> futures prices have dropped significantly from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 2</ENAMEX> a pound at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">midyear</ENAMEX> .
Barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas , downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> , when harvesting and processing of oranges in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> reach their peak , the analyst said .
Energy
Although some analysts look for profit - taking in the wake of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's leap in crude oil prices , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week 's</ENAMEX> rally is generally expected to continue <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> .
`` I would continue to look for a stable crude market , at least in futures '' trading , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Hinton</ENAMEX> , an energy futures broker with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Stotler -AMP- Co</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> capped <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</ENAMEX> of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">West Texas Intermediate</ENAMEX> crude for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> delivery finished at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">20.89</ENAMEX> a barrel , up <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">42 cents</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> markets , meanwhile , spot prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">North Sea</ENAMEX> crudes were up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents</ENAMEX> a barrel .
`` This market still wants to go higher , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nauman Barakat</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ENAMEX> .
He predicted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> contract will reach $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">21.50</ENAMEX> a barrel or more on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> .
There has been little news to account for such buoyancy in the oil markets .
Analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crudes .
There also are recurring reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> is having difficulties with its oil exports and that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX> has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell .
Many traders foresee a tightening of near - term supplies , particularly of high - quality crudes such as those produced in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the North Sea</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX> .
