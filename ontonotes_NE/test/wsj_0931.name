<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> old friends , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng Xiaoping</ENAMEX> , are trying to limit further damage to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - China ties .
But as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> prepares a fresh package of sanctions against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> , the already - tense relationship could get worse .
The problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> will be to weigh what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is saying to its people against the more conciliatory message it is delivering to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration .
In a move apparently aimed at heading off new punitive legislation , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng</ENAMEX> sent an indirect signal to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T.D. Lee</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbia University</ENAMEX> physicist who met Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> leaders in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> .
When he met with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> on his return , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> says , he told the president that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> `` made statements to me that I regard as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> step toward reconciliation . ''
The communication Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> brought represents the softer line the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> has been hoping to hear from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> officials since the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 4</ENAMEX> massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> leader , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> informed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , expressed some regret for what had happened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> and conceded that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's officials bore some responsibility .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng</ENAMEX> told him : `` We should not mind those who participated in demonstrations , signed anti-government materials and went on hunger strikes . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng</ENAMEX> added , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> , that `` we really made mistakes .
We must not shirk our responsibility and we can not just blame the demonstrators . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> also reported to the president that , in a separate meeting , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Communist Party</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang Zemin</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> leadership `` looked kindly on the students who took part in the demonstrations . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang</ENAMEX> also pledged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Red Cross</ENAMEX> would publish `` very soon '' a list of those killed .
And he told the physicist that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's leaders were `` very much concerned '' about the deaths and had arranged aid for the victims ' families .
`` I transmitted my conversations to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> , '' Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> says .
But , he adds , `` I was not acting as a messenger . ''
He says that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> never asked him to convey their statements to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , but that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> spontaneously invited him to do so .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> concedes the statements made to him are far different from others being issued in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , but attributes that to the fact that the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is `` very complex . ''
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> sources in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> , the administration hopes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng</ENAMEX> 's fairly conciliatory comments will prod <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> to be cautious about further sanctions against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
`` The president does n't want to have legislative sanctions , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> official .
`` But he may not have a choice . ''
Given <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's far - from - conciliatory statements to its own people , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> may be unable to prevent new sanctions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> officials have said they will step up the campaign of arrests and intimidation against those who participated in the demonstrations .
Sentences have been stiff .
A university student got <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</ENAMEX> for participating in the rallies , sources in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> said , while an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">18 - year - old</ENAMEX> worker got <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</ENAMEX> .
Nor has <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> hinted to its citizens that it will publish the identities of those killed .
So far , the victims are officially considered evil - doers , and their families receive no compensation .
A man gunned down by a stray bullet while cycling to work carries , after his death , the official stigma of `` counterrevolutionary , '' his wife says .
What 's more , much of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's official rhetoric is hostile to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> frequently lambastes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Embassy</ENAMEX> for harboring astrophysicist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fang Lizhi</ENAMEX> , a political dissident who took refuge there after the massacre .
`` In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , there are still people who want to crush <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and interfere in our internal affairs , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhu Qizhen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's new ambassador to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , said as he left for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> are to begin soon hashing out an agreement for sanctions legislation .
It will probably be attached to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State Department</ENAMEX> authorization bill , which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is n't expected to veto .
A congressional staffer involved in drafting the sanctions says they are likely to mirror those Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> enacted shortly after the massacre .
But as legislative action , they would carry greater weight and would be more difficult to rescind .
Measures already in effect that are expected to be made law include a ban on military sales and exchanges , a suspension of most high - level government contacts and a halt to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade enhancement programs , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Overseas Private Investment Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Trade Development Program</ENAMEX> .
Codifying those sanctions could prompt <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> retaliation .
`` If the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides are n't careful , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - China ties could spin downward , out of control , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> official in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng</ENAMEX> are hoping -LCB- that -RCB- cooler heads prevail .
