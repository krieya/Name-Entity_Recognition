<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">`` Vanity Fair 's ''</ENAMEX> columnist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Fair</ENAMEX> is here .
Quiting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> edition , he describes the journey .
He said he found evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX> 's day of reckoning well overdue .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Hitchens</ENAMEX> joins us from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> .
Good to have you with us .
Thanks for having me .
Your journey , particularly to southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , what is evoked there a sense of both that you evoke is a sense of history of this regime .
Give us your insights as to what you think the future holds .
Do you mean if I start with the Past ?
Not at you will .
Not at all .
Not much of a trip .
I was n't up the sharp end .
I was n't taking risks .
I was n't in a position that my dear friend was in when he was killed outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bagdad</ENAMEX> airport but I had long thought and I was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> in the previous war that really all the talk that had been about the rush to war , the push for war , the drive for war , all that propaganda , was essentially nonsensical because in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> made the only self criticism .
He said , I could either invade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> or finish developing the nuclear weapon .
Maybe before the weapon and then later he said , Oh , I should have got the nuclear weapon before I invaded .
He was right about that , but that means that he inaugurated at that point like a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">dozen - years</ENAMEX> war where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> could be criticized for doing too little and acting too slowly but all we 're arguing about lately is to do with those that should have been finished in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE" S_OFF="1">`91</ENAMEX> when it could have been finished .
Should have taken the side of the rebels then , taken the risk of supporting a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiite</ENAMEX> insurrection at that point , helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kurds</ENAMEX> , removing the regime .
Absolutely .
We 'd be <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">11 years</ENAMEX> into nation building by now if we 'd done that .
That seems to be the core of the argument .
As you point out , of course , for the fact of the matter is , the mistakes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> made possible his removal from power ultimately .
The mistakes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> , again , as you point out , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Schwarzkopf</ENAMEX> making a peace , permitting helicopters to fly .
Still hurts me to read this .
The little town I was in this southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , as far as I got , I ca n't boast of further , is where the talks took place .
We have the transcript of the meeting .
They say , Okay , we have lost this round , Do you mind if we keep your helicopters in the air just to be able to transport things ? and he says , Yeah , that 's all right .
They ask again , Are you sure they mean that ?
They ca n't believe the luck .
They use the gunships to kill , we think , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">not less than 50,000</ENAMEX> inhabitants of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and trying to do that to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kurds</ENAMEX> , as well , so it was a knife edge .
And it 's not just being wise after the event , I believe , to say that there was an argument in realtime between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration members .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> 's the only one I know that changed his mind .
Most of those that took the view at that time , think until recently they were correct in saving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> .
Of course , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> was in the chain of command with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swartzkopf</ENAMEX> and --
Many others .
When they made the decision not to move toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bagdad</ENAMEX> with bad information , namely , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republican Guard</ENAMEX> absolutely devastated .
Yes .
And , well , we know now the harvest of all that .
It hurts to think of how many wonderful people in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> at the academic community , lawyers , human rights activists , civilians , intellectuals , people -- would now be alive , who have been horribly murdered and tortured and reduced to misery since by a half application of violence through sanctions and overflights .
Mistakes made then , mistakes part of human experience , but now we have an opportunity not to make mistakes .
Is it your sense that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> is on the right track ? that there is the prospect here a commitment here on the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> to --
