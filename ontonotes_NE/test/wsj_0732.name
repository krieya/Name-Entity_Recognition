Why do you continually ignore the salubrious effects of indexing the basis of capital gains for inflation ?
Why do you maintain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - passed capital - gains plan is a `` temporary '' reduction when it is not ?
I think the reason is that you are confusing tax `` rates '' with tax `` payments . ''
Your <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 29</ENAMEX> page - <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> story on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - passed capital - gains plan is a good example .
You lead readers to believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> reduced the capital - gains tax for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> only .
You virtually ignore the tax - reducing power of indexation , which in many cases is more substantial than a lower rate .
The monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation : tax rate , times inflation rate , times basis for the gain .
Depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation , indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.6 %</ENAMEX> rate without indexation .
But in any event -- and this is the important point -- tax `` payments '' on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law , even though the tax `` rate '' is the same under both systems .
As you can see , the capital - gains reduction plan adopted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> would not be temporary , but permanent .
I hope that you begin talking about the plan 's permanent and , in my view , most beneficial feature -- indexation .

That the motivation for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> reduction to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.6 %</ENAMEX> is budgetary does not mean it is not in the public interest .
The reduction eases the burden on portfolio changes and frees capital to seek more productive or more appropriate uses .
But what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> .
To argue that this is `` not likely '' to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital - gains tax cuts and to common sense .
A large part of the long - term appreciation of assets reflects inflation , and the taxation of inflation - created capital gains is confiscation .
Does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest ?
Under current law , it is not financially rational to forgo consumption .
Real , aftertax returns from financial assets are on the order of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 % or 2 %</ENAMEX> a year .
The capital - gains tax reform is a step toward correcting one of the gravest structural weaknesses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy , the closely connected phenomena of low savings rates , weak capital formation and high capital costs .
