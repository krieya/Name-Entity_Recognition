Our <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> Nanny
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chou Chin - cheng</ENAMEX> / tr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Williams</ENAMEX> -RRB-
When my wife 's company sent her to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> to work , we did n't think that our daughter , then just over a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> old , would have any problems with attending school there .
Little did we imagine a colleague would inform us that her daughter had been " surrounded and attacked " by a group of young <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> children on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">her first day</ENAMEX> of pre-school .
The incident frightened her so badly that she would n't let her daughter go back to school .
If that was the case , my wife and I had a serious problem on our hands .
What could we do with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> if she was going to be viewed as a " little foreigner " and be bullied at school every day ?
The only solution seemed to be to have her learn <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> .
That way , if we ended up in court , at least she would n't have to stand there mute .
And so we hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Frenchwoman</ENAMEX> in her <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50s</ENAMEX> , to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien 's</ENAMEX> nanny .
My wife truly treasures <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> , and was not at all comfortable with the idea of leaving her with someone else .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , we had no idea what kind of person <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> was .
We knew only that she was a licensed nanny with documents from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> government , and hiring her to look after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> seemed better than hiring a cheaper unlicensed nanny .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> understood no <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> , so we were concerned that she might be mistreated .
We could n't have guessed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> would treasure her just as much as my wife does .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> knew how to handle children !
My wife and I thank Heaven for her .
I remember the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> day we took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> 's place .
My wife and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> played out an extended farewell scene before finally tearfully parting .
And her father ?
Although I understood no <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> in those days , I was prepared to spend the whole day with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> .
I wanted to convey to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> the idea that " if you beat the dog , you 'd better be prepared to deal with the master . "
But in spite of my resolution , within <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> gesturing and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> sobbing , I was hustled out the door .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> , I thought I had better stand outside and " keep an eye on things , " but then I realized that that would n't accomplish anything , and I made my dejected way home .
Later <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> told my wife that I had had to leave unless I wanted to spend my entire life holding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien 's</ENAMEX> hand .
It took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> to remind us that short , sharp pains are better than long , drawn - out suffering .
At the outset , we were concerned that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> would n't like <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> food , so we prepared a lunchbox for her everyday and delivered it with her to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> .
But every evening , her lunchbox came back untouched .
Was n't she eating ?
Thinking , " If this continues , she 'll starve to death , " we confronted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> .
Confronted , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> calmly informed us that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> could n't spend her entire time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> eating the lunchboxes we prepared .
And , she continued , since that was the case , why not get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> used to eating <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> food as soon as possible ?
Furthermore , she informed us that her own nutritious homemade meals would help <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> grow .
She was even planning to prepare a " dinner box " for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> to bring home in the evenings .
Our " confrontation " turned into an abject apology !
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">One day</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> mentioned to us that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> was a little cross-eyed .
However , she said we were not to worry because children 's eyes usually correct themselves as they get older .
To ease our minds , she had already taken <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> to see her uncle , an ophthalmologist .
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> would visit him again <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four or five</ENAMEX> times at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - week</ENAMEX> intervals , everything would be fine .
When we asked her about the fee , she would only say that it should n't be much .
In fact , she never did tell us .
Usually , nannies view sick children as an annoyance because they require more care , and often must be given medication .
As a result , most nannies expect that a child 's family will take care of it when it is sick .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> was different .
When the weather turned cool and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> came down with a fever , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> called my wife to offer to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> for the night .
She told my wife that she had been a nurse and that taking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> home in the cold night air might worsen her chill .
My wife , who had been hoping to take care of our sick daughter herself when she got home from work , naturally declined her kind offer .
In this way , we became more and more comfortable -LRB- and more and more grateful -RRB- having <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien 's</ENAMEX> nanny .
I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien</ENAMEX> just as if she were her own child .
Our daughter is now <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> old and attends a pre-school near our home .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien 's</ENAMEX> teacher has told my wife that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - chien 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> is very good .
Perhaps because our little " foreigner " now speaks <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> , she gets along very well with her classmates ; they all remember her <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> name , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elodie</ENAMEX> , and let her know that I 'm there when they see me coming to pick her up after school .
We owe all of this to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> .
We were lucky to find someone so skilled in the art of being a nanny .
She helped us so much .
Thank you , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martine</ENAMEX> !
