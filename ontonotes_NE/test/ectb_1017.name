Home Is Where the Heart Is Community Activism in a Small <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> Town
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Chiung - fang</ENAMEX> / photos by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh Chi - kuang</ENAMEX> / tr. by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Mayer</ENAMEX> -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year 's</ENAMEX> earthquake may have de-stroyed families and toppled homes , but it also brought people closer together and created new links between local communities .
This has especially been the case with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hsinchu County</ENAMEX> -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taichung County</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
These <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> rural towns are alike in many ways .
Each is predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> , each is located in north - central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , and each has about <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</ENAMEX> inhabitants .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , however , there has been one huge difference -
the earthquake decimated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> but left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> virtually unscathed .
The earthquake killed more people in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> than any other township in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> remains largely in ruins <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a half year later</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> , in the meantime , enjoys a booming tourist industry that just keeps growing .
Since the earthquake , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ta Ai Community Affairs Center</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> -RRB- has lent sustained assistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> in a remarkable display of how a disaster can bring out the best in people .
" Donations and volunteers came flooding in immediately after the earthquake , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsieh Chen - ying</ENAMEX> , " but we all knew that it would n't last for long .
The task of rebuilding is the hard part .
It 's going to take a long time . "
The city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> " adopted " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> after the earthquake , assigning personnel from its various ward offices to stay on long - term in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> and assist with earthquake recovery .
Mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> , however , is joined in this task by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> , which is among the few organizations that have provided continuous assistance ever since the quake .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> lends a helping hand
Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu Shih - wei</ENAMEX> , director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> , " There is just so much to do after a disaster of this magnitude .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> and the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> have only got so many resources . "
In the little community of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> managed to collect <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> truckloads of relief supplies and over NT$ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">400,000</ENAMEX> after the earthquake .
In order to put it to the best possible use , they toured the disaster area several times and decided to devote all their energies to help the recovery effort in the township of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taichung County</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> towns are not so far apart - <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">about two hours</ENAMEX> by car .
Besides their common ethnicity , the seriousness of the damage in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> was a major reason why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> chose to concentrate on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> is located on the banks of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Tachia River</ENAMEX> , and was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the areas most heavily hit by the quake , with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">178</ENAMEX> deaths , over <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,200</ENAMEX> buildings totally destroyed , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 500</ENAMEX> homes partially destroyed , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">dozens</ENAMEX> of historic old structures demolished .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> had already been active in community development efforts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> , and its members knew from this experience that rebuilding from the earthquake would take a long time , so they set up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shihkang Work Station</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tuniu Elementary School</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late October</ENAMEX> and made plans to stay for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shihkang Newsletter</ENAMEX>
The main task of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Work Station</ENAMEX> is to publish the fortnightly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shihkang Newsletter</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> edition of this <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - page newsletter went out <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last November 8th</ENAMEX> .
It reports on everyday life in the disaster area and matters related to the recovery effort .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Chieh - ying</ENAMEX> has been working full - time at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Shihkang Work Station</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX> , the newsletter is extremely important to people in the disaster area for a couple of reasons .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Firstly</ENAMEX> , it enables people to share information .
People can see that they are not alone in their suffering , and that they must address their situation from a collective standpoint instead of chasing after individual problems <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> at a time .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</ENAMEX> , people in the disaster area need information from the outside world , and now that the news media have shifted their attention to other matters , the local people need an avenue by which to get their message out to the rest of the world .
The newsletter is just the thing to accomplish these objectives .
This newsletter has also helped to spur increased contact between the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Chieh - ying</ENAMEX> , they distribute <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</ENAMEX> copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Shihkang Newsletter</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tungshih</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shinshe</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> , which enables the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> to truly get a feel for what is needed in the disaster area .
By sending a person to serve full - time at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Shihkang Work Station</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> has managed to quickly integrate itself into the local community in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> , and to see where assistance is most urgently needed .
The children of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> , for example , are in especially great need of psychological counseling , so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Hsiuh - li Liuh Memorial Foundation</ENAMEX> to provide therapy for children and teachers .
In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Shihkang Work Station</ENAMEX> is also helping to build prefab shelters .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Far Eastern group</ENAMEX> only donated <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> prefab units , and people in less than privileged situations -LRB- such as renters and those living in illegally constructed residences -RRB- were not even eligible to apply for them , so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> has been working hard to put up prefab units for the residents of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tzu - yun Lane</ENAMEX> .
Several old residences collapsed there , causing numerous deaths and injuries .
The work on the prefab units has been a race against time , for as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu Shih - wei</ENAMEX> points out , some people in the disaster area have died of cold over the winter .
To survive the great earthquake only to die because of an inadequate relief effort seems the height of injustice .

How has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> managed to deliver such steady assistance to people in the disaster area ?
What do they have that sets them apart ?
It all has to do with their experience with community activism in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> .
You wo n't find the name <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ta Ai</ENAMEX> on a map of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hsinchu County</ENAMEX> , for it is an administrative division not of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> government , but of the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yimin Temple</ENAMEX> of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hsinchu</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ta Ai</ENAMEX> area encompasses the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> townships of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paoshan</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omei</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yimin Temple</ENAMEX> commands the allegiance of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> faithful in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> different temple districts , of which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ta Ai</ENAMEX> district is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu Township</ENAMEX> lies immediately southwest of the town of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chutung</ENAMEX> , and is surrounded by mountains .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 %</ENAMEX> of its roughly <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</ENAMEX> residents are <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> .
Located in the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tzu - tien Temple</ENAMEX> , the town 's main landmark , and the bustling streets that run past the temple offer the best shopping and eating in town .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> operates out of an office in the middle of town .
The traditional architecture of the building is a very pleasant sight .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu Shih - wei</ENAMEX> , the key mover and shaker at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> , was born to parents from the mainland and grew up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kaohsiung</ENAMEX> .
Formerly a professor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chung Yuan Christian University</ENAMEX> , he <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> ago to help a colleague study the local architecture .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu</ENAMEX> 's role in the project was to study the sociology of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> and gain a clear understanding of life in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> town .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu</ENAMEX> ended up staying on in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> after the project came to an end , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> he serves as director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> .
Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu</ENAMEX> , " Now I can understand about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 - 70 %</ENAMEX> of what people say in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> ! "
How it all started
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> was established almost by accident .
After settling in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu</ENAMEX> gradually put down roots in the local community and made friends .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1996</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu</ENAMEX> and a few women got to talking about education and they hatched an idea to set up an after - school study center .
The local <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Catholic</ENAMEX> church donated space for the center , and the project was soon launched .
They also set up a small library , and local residents generously donated many books .
Thanks to the center , a group of concerned local citizens started seeing each other quite frequently , and they ended up establishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ta Ai Community Affairs Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1997</ENAMEX> .
They chose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Yi - sen</ENAMEX> , the owner of a local dry goods store , as the chairman , and selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu</ENAMEX> as director .
The new organization resolved to work toward the achievement of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> goals : " A better standard of living , in both the material and spiritual sense .
Preservation and development of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> culture .
Preservation of the environment and development of local industry .
Development of community education for people of all ages . "
After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> was officially established , its main project was the publication of a bimonthly newsletter .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The TCAC Newsletter</ENAMEX> provided the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> with an opportunity to speak their minds on such issues as preservation of local streams , their love for their hometown , and various local affairs .
Pitching in
A young man wrote in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the TCAC Newsletter</ENAMEX> , " I used to have a job in another town , and every time I came back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> I would go straight to the noodle shop and wolf down a bowl of bantiao noodles even before stopping to say hello to my parents .
Until I had eaten a bowl of bantiao , I did n't feel like I was back home yet . "
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu Shih - wei</ENAMEX> , keeping the newsletter in print for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three years</ENAMEX> has been no small accomplishment .
" These people do n't write for a living .
A person might spend <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">four or five hours</ENAMEX> writing up a short little article . "
In addition to the newsletter , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> has also been involved in many local activities .
" A lot of interesting stuff goes on in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> town , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu</ENAMEX> , adding that when help is needed the locals are likely to contribute not just money but something even more valuable - their time and energy .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> puts on an activity , for example , if someone notices that an event organizer is getting thirsty they will immediately bring him a bottle of mineral water .
When a musical performance is scheduled , someone will always take it upon themselves to set out seats for the audience .
" If the local residents agree with what you 're doing , they 're sure to pitch in and help , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu</ENAMEX> , who considers this spirit of volunteerism much more valuable than monetary donations .
That is why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> has been able to carry out so many activities over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</ENAMEX> without spending any money .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> residents have taken part enthusiastically in recycling campaigns , flea markets , and post-harvest yam roasts , and events of this nature have even drawn participants from out of town .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Yi - sen</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> organized a camping trip <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , participants from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chutung</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toufen</ENAMEX> , and elsewhere actually outnumbered the locals .
We miss our walkways !
Thanks to the energy and dedication of nine regular staff and many enthusiastic volunteers , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> has managed to make a difference in this small <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> township over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</ENAMEX> .
Most notably , the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> have begun to sense the value of what they 've got in their community .
The campaign to beautify <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hsia Street</ENAMEX> is an excellent case in point .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Seven years ago</ENAMEX> , in order to ease the problem of increasing traffic congestion , the township widened <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hsia Street</ENAMEX> .
The project required demolition of all the covered walkways that used to stand outside the stores there .
It seemed like a laudable move toward modernization at the time , but people living along the street came to rue the loss of their covered walkways .
Cars came roaring down in great numbers along the widened street , while the residents lost the space in front of their homes where they had once enjoyed many a leisurely hour .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Yi - sen</ENAMEX> , whose store is located on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hsia Street</ENAMEX> , everybody used to congregate in the cool shade of the walkways in the summer .
Neighbors were more involved with each other , and his <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> children always had a place to play .
Now that the covered walkways have been replaced by parking spaces , people scarcely leave their homes .
The old folks stay inside watching television , while the young people only emerge briefly on their way to work .
People rarely have a chance to speak to each other anymore .
Fortunately , the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> quickly realized their mistake .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Council for Cultural Affairs</ENAMEX> for authorization to carry out a campaign to beautify <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hsia Street</ENAMEX> .
The residents did everything they could to restore something of their former neighborhood .
They erected street lamps and put out benches where people could sit and chat , and have succeeded in creating a very friendly atmosphere .
The gaily lit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hsia Street</ENAMEX> seems almost to have returned to an earlier time .
It might be impossible for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hsia Street</ENAMEX> to ever be exactly the same as it once was , but the beautification campaign taught the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> the value of what they have .
When the town hall made plans to rip up the stone steps on the long pathway leading up the mountainside at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hsiuluan Park</ENAMEX> and replace them with imported stone , local citizens protested , asking the town hall to leave the steps as they were .
In the end they succeeded in keeping part of the steps untouched .
States <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang</ENAMEX> with a sigh , " There 's not much left that 's really worth passing on to our grandchildren .
We ca n't keep destroying things . "
Do you remember ?
The scope of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> activities is not limited to improving the quality of old neighborhoods .
The organization is also active in the effort to preserve the local environment .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu Shih - wei</ENAMEX> points out that for an agricultural community like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> , streams are an indispensable resource .
Aquatic life on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Taping River</ENAMEX> , however , is dwindling due to destruction of the surrounding environment and excessive gravel mining on the river bed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last April</ENAMEX> , over <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> people from the townships of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omei</ENAMEX> organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the TCAC Taping River Preservation Team</ENAMEX> .
In addition to holding meetings throughout the local area to show slides and publicize the river 's plight , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the River Preservation Team</ENAMEX> also posted notices on the riverbank in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May</ENAMEX> asking locals and out - of - town visitors not to poison or electrocute fish or catch them in nets .
The team also goes out occasionally to pick up trash and patrol the river .
Besides these activities , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> also offers regularly scheduled classes for both children and adults .
Current offerings include a class on environmental preservation for children , while for both children and adults there are classes on calligraphy , traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> folk songs , and local history .
Every Wednesday evening you can hear the strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> folk songs coming from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> .
The youngest participants in the class are just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven or eight</ENAMEX> , while the oldest range on up to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 or 80</ENAMEX> .
Every one of the lilting melodies carries with it a nugget of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> culture .
Even more interestingly , the teacher makes up lyrics about the river preservation campaign and sets them to traditional folk melodies , thus melding the old and the new .
In the class on local history , the participants themselves do all the talking .
They exchange stories about the past and talk about places whose names no longer even appear on the maps .
Everyone works in this way to call up a collective memory of local history .
Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu Shih - wei</ENAMEX> , " By sharing our experiences we can get everybody to take an active interest in the changes that are taking place in the local community . "
Outgrowths of the class include the river preservation campaign and a guidebook for tourists interested in learning about environmental issues and local history .
Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shu</ENAMEX> , " Forget about all the high - falutin' talk about ' urban redevelopment ' and whatnot - everyone cares about what goes on in their town .
But you 've got to find a way to get everybody working together so you can actually get something done , otherwise all talk about local affairs wo n't amount to anything more than people doing a bit of idle chatting and complaining around the dinner table . "
Hard times , warm hearts
With such a vigorous network of local volunteers already in place , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> was prepared to act quickly when the earthquake hit central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last September</ENAMEX> .
After zeroing in on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> as the beneficiary of its assistance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> wasted no time in sending relief supplies , establishing a newsletter , and building prefab shelters .
In working together on the recovery effort , the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> have built up close personal ties .
At a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">New Year 's</ENAMEX> celebration in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsieh Chen - ying</ENAMEX> gave the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> a gift as a token of gratitude for their generous assistance , and when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> board members traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> to inspect the progress on the prefab shelters , they took advantage of the occasion to exchange views with local residents .
" I 'm very excited about the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - way channel of communication that we 've established , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Chieh - ying</ENAMEX> , and he adds that this communication is a source of strength that has enabled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Shihkang Work Station</ENAMEX> to keep going .
The prefab units that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TCAC</ENAMEX> helped build at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tuniu Elementary School</ENAMEX> were completed on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February 28th</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Chieh - ying</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Shihkang Work Station</ENAMEX> is now concentrating primarily on gaining a clear picture of what is needed to get people back to work .
Although the original plan only calls for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Shihkang Work Station</ENAMEX> to operate for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Chieh - ying</ENAMEX> opines , " I have my doubts about whether we 'll actually be able to leave after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</ENAMEX> . "
He feels that the cooperative relationship and emotional ties that have been forged between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> ought to be kept alive , and he hopes that the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ta Ai</ENAMEX> will be able to share their know - how in community activism with other localities so that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> can recover the vibrant communities that it lost in the earthquake .

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ta Ai Community Affairs Center</ENAMEX> built <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</ENAMEX> prefab shelters at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tuniu Elementary School</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> .
Performers of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> music came from both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shihkang</ENAMEX> to celebrate the completion of the shelters .

The sight of the river spilling over a newly created drop - off in the formerly flat riverbed at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shihkang Dam</ENAMEX> gives stunning testimony to the power of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year 's</ENAMEX> earthquake .
The bridge is being left as is to serve as a monument to the quake .

The people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> have come to understand the value of their heritage , and have begun working to preserve old buildings .
In restoring old residences , they are eschewing modern building materials and using the methods of the past .

Shop signs everywhere advertise such typical <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> items as bantiao noodles , lei tea -LRB- which has peanut powder and other high - calorie ingredients mixed into it -RRB- , and dried persimmons .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peipu</ENAMEX> 's distinctly <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> atmosphere is perhaps the town 's most striking feature .
