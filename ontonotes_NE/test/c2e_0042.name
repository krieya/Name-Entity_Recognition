Be Your Own Psychiatrist .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Xu .</ENAMEX>
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's society , fierce competition , cultural conflicts and material temptation disturb our minds incessantly , which often make us feel worried , anxious , upset and furious .
People also try to adjust themselves in material ways , but those often fail to work : exercises can not lessen the concerns at heart ; physical and mental fatigue persist not long after traveling ; the soft water bed can not bring comfortable sleeps ; and the luxurious room can not dispel the disputes of spouses .
That 's why someone proposes that modern people learn a new survival skill -- learn to be your own psychiatrist , helping yourself to dissolve all sorts of metal stresses at work and in life .
Be your own psychiatrist , simply put , is to improve your ability adjust yourself psychologically .
To elaborate , it means there should be a special role in your mind who possesses " the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> eye " mentally to observe your emotional changes sensibly and find out the reasons for mental disturbances .
It is just like the " guardian angel " whom everyone has in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> legends , who gives you wisdom at critical moments and help you deal with the intricate reality properly , so that you will not lose direction .
There was a famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> psychologist named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last century</ENAMEX> , who encouraged people to learn a special , reasonable and healthy way of thinking by reading professional books , organizing group discussions and doing specific training in thinking , in order to deal with emotional problems caused by stresses .
He should be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> one to advocate " learn to be your own psychiatrist . "
He encourages people to learn a new way of thinking like " learning a foreign language . "
The most important aspect in being your own psychiatrist is to learn to substitute the healthy way of thinking for the unhealthy way of thinking .
For example , ask <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> people to observe the same glass , if one notices a tiny speckle and the other notices the mild color , then the former 's thinking pattern might be pessimistic , while the latter might be more sensitive to the positive aspect of things , which is a healthy and optimistic way of thinking .
Thus , learn to observe the positive aspect of things has become an important training .
To be your own psychiatrist , you should also learn to observe stress - related signs .
For example , if you have a stomachache , your normal response is to see a gastroenterologist .
Through observation by " the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> eye , " you may see that the reason can be your new demanding boss .
To be your own psychiatrist , you also need to learn appropriate knowledge .
There was a student at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Tsinghua University</ENAMEX> , who were troubled by " depression " for a while .
When it was bad , he wanted to jump out and commit suicide at the sight of a window .
With some psychological knowledge , he knew it was a symptom of mental disorder , so he immediately sought help from professionals and received treatment soon .
Now in many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> countries , some intellectuals including young college students like to read psychological books .
Psychological books can always be seen in the best seller lists in these countries .
Most readers do not aim to become counsellors , but to learn psychological knowledge to help personal growth .
Such healthy awareness is worth learning .
