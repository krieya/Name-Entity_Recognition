A bitter conflict with global implications has erupted between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nomura Securities Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Industrial Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of the world 's most powerful financial companies .
The clash is a sign of a new toughness and divisiveness in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's once - cozy financial circles .
Not only are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's financial institutions putting their enormous clout to work ; increasingly they 're squaring off against one another in unprecedented public fashion .
Already , the consequences are being felt by other players in the financial markets -- even governments .
What triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> government bond issue .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nomura</ENAMEX> was attempting to organize the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 billion - yen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 352 million</ENAMEX> -RRB- borrowing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> at a time when many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks , led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Industrial Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> , were pressuring the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellington</ENAMEX> government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand 's</ENAMEX> civil - service pension fund .
Unwilling to put up new money for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> until those debts are repaid , most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing , forcing an embarrassed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nomura</ENAMEX> to postpone it <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> .
The dispute shows clearly the global power of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's financial titans .
Aside from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nomura</ENAMEX> 's injured pride , the biggest victim so far has been the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> government .
Barred by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellington</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Debt Management Office</ENAMEX> had been casting abroad to raise <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">the 3 billion New Zealand dollars</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 1.76 billion</ENAMEX> -RRB- to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NZ$ 4 billion</ENAMEX> it needs to come up with by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of its fiscal year next June 30</ENAMEX> .
With <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's cash - flush banks aligned against it , though , raising money may be difficult .
Not only can they block <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellington</ENAMEX> from raising money in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , bankers here say , but as the largest underwriters in the Eurobond market , they might be able to scuttle borrowings there , too .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand 's</ENAMEX> finance minister , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Caygill</ENAMEX> , lashed out at such suggestions .
He told reporters in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> that the government had n't guaranteed the loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DFC New Zealand Ltd.</ENAMEX> , an investment bank <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</ENAMEX> - owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Provident Fund</ENAMEX> , and would n't bail it out .
`` It may very well be what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks want , '' he told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Radio New Zealand</ENAMEX> .
`` I think it would be irresponsible and I am not about to be blackmailed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks or any other international interests . ''
No less significant than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> banks ' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> securities and banking industries .
Anxiety is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate -- and protect -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> industries from each other .
Both sides are jealously guarding their turf , and relations have been at a flashpoint for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> .
The banks badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business .
Meanwhile , the securities companies -- most of them smaller than the banks -- are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that would n't open them to the full brunt of competition from the banks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nomura</ENAMEX> , the world 's biggest securities company largely by virtue of its protected home field , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Industrial Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's most innovative and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad , captain the opposing sides .
And their suspicions of each other run deep .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</ENAMEX> , both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nomura</ENAMEX> started a credit - card venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express Co.</ENAMEX> that allowed cardholders to use their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nomura</ENAMEX> securities accounts like a bank account , attracting the wrath of banks .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Industrial Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> started up a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> securities subsidiary that sells <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> stocks to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="4">non-Japanese</ENAMEX> institutions overseas , a move that stirred the anger of the stock brokerage firms .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> bond issue simply has brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> institutions face - to - face .
