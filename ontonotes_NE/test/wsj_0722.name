Under the plan , the companies will use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Calgene</ENAMEX> 's patented technology to encapsulate microbes such as Bacillus subtilis , a bacterium , to enhance their biological activity against plant diseases .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Calgene</ENAMEX> , an agricultural biotechnology concern , said initial work will concentrate on a proprietary strain of Bacillus subtilis which has shown promise for controlling aflatoxin .
The strain was discovered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Morinaga -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> and licensed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gustafson</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Uniroyal Chemical Co</ENAMEX> .
Aflatoxin is released by molds during grain and seed storage .
The recent appearance of aflatoxin in such foods as corn and peanut butter has sparked public concern and consumer scrutiny of food handling and storage procedures .
