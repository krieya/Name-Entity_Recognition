It was supposed to be a routine courtesy call .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A half - dozen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> space officials , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> for an exhibit , stopped by to see their counterparts at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Space Development Agency</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
But after a few pleasantries , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> unexpectedly got serious .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> have a world - leading space program , the guests noted .
Would n't the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> like a piece of it ?
The visitors then listed technologies up for sale , including launch services and propulsion hardware .
`` We were just surprised , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tad Inada</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASDA</ENAMEX> 's director for international affairs .
`` Shocked . ''
That <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> , with its dilapidated economic machine , would try to sell high technology to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the world 's high - tech leaders , sounds like a coals - to - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newcastle</ENAMEX> notion .
But `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> has areas where it is n't behind <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Shapovalov</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations</ENAMEX> .
`` We have obtained through the development of Cosmos -LCB- the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> space program -RCB- technologies you do n't see anywhere else . ''
The sales pitch might n't be as farfetched as it seems .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> - U.S. trade relations are bumpy <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> , and some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> favor decreasing their reliance on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> technology in light of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FSX fighter - plane</ENAMEX> flap , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials reversed an earlier decision and refused to share certain crucial fighter - plane technology .
And , despite its image as a technology superpower , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> has a lot of weaknesses .
It 's a world leader in semiconductors , but behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> in making the computers that use those chips .
It 's a world leader in auto manufacturing , but its aviation industry is struggling , and its space program is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Europeans</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> question being debated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> is how to use the defense sector 's research - and - production expertise in the rest of the economy .
Many plants that used to make military equipment are now being ordered to produce televisions , videocassette recorders , small tractors and food - processing machinery .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> also hope to make better use of their considerable expertise in theoretical science , which has helped them win <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice as many</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> science prizes as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> .
Where they lag behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> is in turning the scientific inventiveness into improved production .
By contrast , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> have proved adept at making use of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> inventions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kobe Steel Ltd.</ENAMEX> adopted <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> casting technology in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</ENAMEX> and used it for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">14 years</ENAMEX> until it developed its own system .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kawasaki Steel Corp.</ENAMEX> bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> steel - casting patent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> and has jointly developed the system with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> will take a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> journalist into space , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> to go into orbit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> efforts to sell their technology abroad do n't appear to worry the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's principal ally .
`` We have never opposed the development of economic relations between our allies and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State Department</ENAMEX> official .
`` Frankly , I would n't expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> to get hooked on anybody 's technology , least of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> . ''
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev 's</ENAMEX> perestroika , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> have sought economic ties all over the world , including new export markets .
They believe technology is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of their best bets , and some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> officials say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> will even consider declassifying military know - how if the price is right .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> held export exhibitions that included high - tech items in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> delegation came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> to push more space technologies .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> is a major target for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , representatives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Keidanren</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's largest business organization , visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> to explore exports and investments that would help the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> economy .
Out of the blue , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Soviet Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> handed over details on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</ENAMEX> technologies that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> might want to buy .
These mainly involved such areas as materials -- advanced soldering machines , for example -- and medical developments derived from experimentation in space , such as artificial blood vessels .
A main motive is hard cash .
But , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> ca n't expect direct technology flow from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , they also hope to benefit from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> manufacturing expertise .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Soviet Union</ENAMEX> has a lot of know - how , but it has been difficult to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shapovalov</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> official .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> are `` contemplating a flexible system under which it would be possible to develop -LCB- technology -RCB- jointly and even to market it jointly , '' he says .
Even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> find <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> technology desirable , such discussions would be fraught with political complications .
Still stinging from the international backlash over the sale <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> of sensitive military technology to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> by a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toshiba Corp.</ENAMEX> , many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> are eager to avoid appearing to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> in any way .
Another hurdle concerns <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's attempts to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> to relinquish its <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT" S_OFF="5">post-World War II</ENAMEX> control of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> islands north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
So far , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> have provided only the sketchiest information about their technology and business plans .
And what they have shown is n't impressive .
`` My impression is that there is n't anything which arouses our interest at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> glance , '' says an official from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ministry of International Trade and Industry</ENAMEX> .
