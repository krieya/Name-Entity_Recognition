<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maggie Thatcher</ENAMEX> must be doing something right ; her political enemies are screaming louder than ever .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> , who was practicing the read - my - lips school of politics <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> encountered it , has made clear her opposition to refashioning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's free - market policies to suit the bureaucrats in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brussels</ENAMEX> .
In return , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> is excoriated from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fleet Street</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> as an obstructionist .
Well , it now turns out that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> had to travel across the globe to the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</ENAMEX> - member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Commonwealth</ENAMEX> summit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> to discomfit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Holy Order of Consensus Builders</ENAMEX> .
`` A disastrous farce in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> , '' screamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Manchester Guardian</ENAMEX> .
`` She can no longer be trusted to behave in a civilised -- that is unflaky -- fashion when abroad . ''
Egad .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mulroney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Hawke</ENAMEX> , the paper said , were `` enraged . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The London Times</ENAMEX> said she had `` contravened protocol . ''
As usual , her sin was saying what she thought .
She issued a separate statement , separating herself from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Commonwealth</ENAMEX> document reasserting the political value of imposing sanctions against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> .
While supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Commonwealth</ENAMEX> `` in utterly condemning apartheid , '' her statement urged it to `` encourage change '' rather than inflict further punishment on the country 's black population .
Actually there is a consensus somewhere on sanctions : In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May</ENAMEX> a Gallup Poll found that most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South African</ENAMEX> blacks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</ENAMEX> , oppose economic sanctions .
Still , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> had once again gone against the grain .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> 's Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahathir Mohamad</ENAMEX> sniffed , `` If everybody else puts out their left foot and you put out your right foot , you are out of step . ''
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> : `` If it 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</ENAMEX> , I 'm very sorry for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</ENAMEX> . ''
If indeed Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> opponent that could throw her off political course it is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's mysteriously intractable inflation problem .
We can not , however , join the political chorus that as one proclaims how offputting it is that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> refuses to get along by going along .
It is refreshing to see at least <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> world figure who knows what she believes in and is not inclined to reflexively compromise those beliefs .
Perhaps Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> understands better than those distressed at her style that ultimately history and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's voters will decide who is right about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , sanctioning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> or running <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's economy .
