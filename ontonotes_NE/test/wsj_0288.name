President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> will hold an informal meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early December</ENAMEX> , a move that should give both leaders a political boost at home .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The White House</ENAMEX> is purposely not calling the meeting a summit so that there wo n't be any expectation of detailed negotiations or agreements .
Rather , senior administration officials said that the unexpected meeting was scheduled at Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's request because of his preference for conducting diplomacy through highly personal and informal meetings with other leaders .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> leaders will meet on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">3</ENAMEX> , alternating <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the two days</ENAMEX> of meetings between a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> naval vessel in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Mediterranean Sea</ENAMEX> .
The unusual seaborne meeting wo n't disrupt plans for a formal summit meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next spring</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</ENAMEX> , at which an arms - control treaty is likely to be completed .
In announcing the meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told reporters at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> that neither he nor Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> expects any `` substantial decisions or agreements . ''
Instead , he said that the purpose is simply for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> to get `` better acquainted '' and discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda .
Despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations , the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both leaders .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest he faces at home .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> officials have said that a meeting with the leader of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> could help bolster his stature among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> politicians and academics , whose support he needs .
For his part , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has been criticized regularly at home for moving too slowly and cautiously in reacting to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's reforms and the historic moves away from communism in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> .
A face - to - face meeting with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> should damp such criticism , though it will hardly eliminate it .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> -RRB- , who has been the most prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> critic of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's handling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> relationship , praised the president for arranging the meeting .
But he added : `` The mere fact of a meeting does n't deal with the substance of policy . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> meeting , which was announced simultaneously in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> , will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the `` fanfare '' and force the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers .
`` By doing it in this manner we can have , I would say , more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances , things of that nature for public consumption , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> , at a news conference in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> , said , `` As the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides plan to hold a full - scale summit in late spring - early summer next year , they found it useful , I would say even necessary , to hold an interim informal meeting . ''
Although no specific agreements are expected , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> said `` that does n't mean they will be without an agenda . ''
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> leaders cover the subjects that have been featured in lower level <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - Soviet meetings , their talks would include human rights , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> reforms , regional disputes , relations with allies , economic cooperation , arms control , and joint efforts to fight narcotics , terrorism and pollution .
The president specifically mentioned <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economic advice to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> as a possible topic .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> has for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> been publicly urging the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> to drop its restrictions on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> trade .
He recently told a small group of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> businessmen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , possibly at the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> summit .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> hope a trade agreement would give them Most - Favored Nation status , which would lower the tariffs on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> exports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
In an unusually candid article about the latest economic woe -- unemployment -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pravda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> have lost their jobs as a result of perestroika and the number could grow to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 million</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2005</ENAMEX> .
Economists in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">now</ENAMEX> proposing that the state start a system of unemployment benefits .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration official knowledgeable about the summit plan cautioned against assuming that there will be bold new initiatives on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> economy or other issues .
`` Do n't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation , or arms control , or the environment , '' he said .
`` Those things will all come up , but in a fairly informal way . ''
Instead , this official said , `` This is vintage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> .
This was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush 's</ENAMEX> own idea .
It 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> wanting to meet a foreign leader and talk to him directly . ''
Aside from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> economic plight and talks on cutting strategic and chemical arms , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> other issue the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> are likely to want to raise is naval force reductions .
Western analysts say that , given the meeting 's setting at sea , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once again for negotiated cuts in the navies of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the North Atlantic Treaty Organization</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Warsaw Pact</ENAMEX> .
That theme has been a recurring one for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> military officials for much of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
They argue that as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kremlin</ENAMEX> follows through on announced plans to cut land forces -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> ' area of greatest strength -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> should show more willingness to cut sea forces -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> 's area of greatest superiority .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of the reasons <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration aides are anxious to insist that the coming meeting will be informal is to avoid comparisons with the last such loosely structured superpower gathering , former President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> meeting with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reykjavik</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iceland</ENAMEX> .
That meeting sent shivers through the Western alliance because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> allies .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said that he initiated talks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> on the informal meeting by sending a proposal to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last July</ENAMEX> , which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> leader readily accepted .
But word of the possible session was closely held by the president and a handful of top aides , and word of it did n't reach many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> - level officials until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few days</ENAMEX> .
Indeed , many senior officials had been insisting for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</ENAMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> was n't interested in such an informal get - together .
Though President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's political critics at home have been urging him to open a more direct dialogue with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> , it actually was the arguments of leaders within the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> bloc itself that led the president to seek the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> meeting .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> decided he wanted the meeting after talking in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> with the leaders of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> , who urged him to support Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's efforts to transform the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> system and to urge him to loosen his grip on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> , a senior aide said .
While flying home from those discussions , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> drafted a letter to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> suggesting an informal get - together to precede their formal summit <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
