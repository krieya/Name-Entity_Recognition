Well , How do you feel about that ?
Well , that 's okay
That was weird
yeah ,
I thought I had to start right away ,
my God , I have <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">another half an hour</ENAMEX> .
You better have a lot to tell me .
I do n't know .
I do n't know
I do n't have a lot to tell you because my life is much the same here ,
just lots of company .
Lots of kids .
But it was fun .
It was fun to have them , you know like do things with them that I do n't ordinarily do
And now %um <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mindy</ENAMEX> is coming with her family on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX>
so we decided we 'd take about <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</ENAMEX> off .
They 'll be here for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</ENAMEX>
so we 'll be here for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> week with them .
And that will be good .
%uh
yeah .
Anyhow , she 's so busy
did you get her invitation for the
I did
and I sent back %uh my oh good . R S V P for just just for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of us though because yeah . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> has that 's the same day that %um
you know tha- the thing that %uh we usually go to in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boca Raton</ENAMEX> ?
yeah
down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>
yeah
yeah ,
well this year they switched it from Where is it ? <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> or from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> whenever it was yeah right to that
it starts that day .
oh phoo .
So ,
Now where is it taking place now ?
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boca Raton</ENAMEX> again .
oh again . %ah
So I think what I 'm going to do is %um ,
well we 'll just we 'll both probably
the way it works I 'll just leave the same time except I will head for yeah yeah oh great . there and he 'll head for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>
great .
oh great .
Well I 'm going to take %uh a room in that in the hotel too over the weekend
I think I 'll probably go in earlier in the week
And %uh
but I thought I 'd also stay at the hotel because there will be so many people there that I 'd like to see .
%ah
So I , I I
if you if you %uh saw that response card it said something about calling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hilton</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mindy</ENAMEX> had a special pri- a rate yeah . for the family which was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">seventy - nine dollars</ENAMEX>
so if it 's anything other than that insist that you 're with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Landau</ENAMEX> party .
oh . okay .
Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huck</ENAMEX> 's sister had called and they had told her <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">ninety - nine dollars</ENAMEX>
and Min- and when I spoke to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mindy</ENAMEX> she said she had just rechecked with them <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX>
so there was some misunderstanding there
%huh !
but nevertheless . We 're looking forward to it .
It 's the first family get - together we 've had in a long time .
I know
that 's why I would yeah do n't want to miss it .
I
yeah
and so it should be fun .
I do n't know %uh .

Are they selling well ?
I think they 're doing okay
and this time they 're Good . sending me around
and %um yeah so I 'll be in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> then
and then I thought if if it turns out that oh it 's too crowded you know that sometimes they send you in and there 's no real block of time oh yeah . then %um then after the bat mitzvah bar mitzvah bat mitzvah
but anyway yeah yeah . %um <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> will still be in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> for for a couple
so I think I 'll go up yeah . like to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> again

oh well that would be nice
and then I can really visit
there 's a lot of people I 'd love to see
I have n't oh I know . I have n't seen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearl</ENAMEX> .
How is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearl</ENAMEX> doing ?
oh I just talked to her .
She had another setback <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about two weeks ago</ENAMEX>
she had a small stroke
oh my God
but she was in the hospital with that for a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX>
but I just talked to her
her arm her left arm and she happens to be lefthanded %uh was hit
and %um she said she 's getting it back .
She 's almost able to write again .
In fact she 's been trying to .
%uh
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> was really her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> day that she was out
and %ah she 's so fantastic .
Every time I call her she just you know always sounds so up .
Of course I talked to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> too
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> always sounds so down
yeah ,
I think j-
she 's so
oh it 's really hitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> so hard .
She 's just very upset about it .
But oh I just hope to God she gets over the c- the cancer part .
That 's the worst part
and I have
I think that the other lung is affected too
but sh-
yeah .
oh God
not going to do chemotherapy again .
She just does n't want to
%uh
I had been down to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlantic City</ENAMEX>
oh I think it was my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fiftieth</ENAMEX> high school reunion <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early June</ENAMEX>
and I stayed with them that weekend
and sh- we had such a good time .
She was great
and that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> night while we were there she had that small heart attack .
Did you know about that ?
No .
yeah ,
she had that %eh she had a heart attack that night
%uh
She was having a great deal of pressure and pain
and you know we thought maybe it 's indigestion or this or that
and she oh did n't want to go to the hospital there
so they went straight on home
and it was hard for them
it was w- she was in a lot of pain
but she did have a heart attack
oh well that 's that 's of course related to the stroke that she just had .
oh
%uh
yeah
I tell you
it 's just been one thing after another
and as soon she has gotten over one she 's just hit with something else
but when you talk to her she 's just wonderful you know
she just really tries to keep her spirits up and tries to help everybody else .
The kids her kids have been great
and Jackie has been great
poor
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> did get to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlantic City</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">month</ENAMEX> .
She had rented a place there .
oh
yeah
so she had a good good month
that 's good
It was n't until the end that %uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearl</ENAMEX> was n't so well s- was n't feeling so well again .
oh
But it 's stinky !
It is .
It is just
I know .
We 've had a very stinky %um
We 're fine
yeah
but I 've we 've had so many friends actually
I think that 's part of what has occupied me since really really April I think whatever the day of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> Real- Seder
yeah
You probably even remember him .
Remember our friend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Bryner</ENAMEX> .

I 'm not sure that I do remember
oh
and he always %uh he was part of the biking group
uh-huh
and either he had I think he had a bad bike accident %um
really
but th- th- they do n't know if it was a bad bike accident or a major stroke that uh-huh created a bi-
but he is yeah %uh w- he nearly died
we s- we spent a lot of time there
he was
oh

oh God
and he is now he 's still in a rehabilitation oh really hospital did n't die
but he 's paralysed on one side
and he 's oh God blin- half blind
and he
oh what a shame
is he about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> 's age ?
and so that
yeah

and it 's been horrible
yeah
