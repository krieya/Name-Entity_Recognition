What if it happened to us ?
In the wake of the earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and the devastation of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> , many companies in disaster - prone areas are pondering the question of preparedness .
Some , particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West Coast</ENAMEX> earthquake zones , are dusting off their evacuation plans , checking food stocks and reminding employees of what to do if emergency strikes .
Others say they feel confident that steps they 've already taken would see them through a disaster .
Preparedness involves more than flashlights and fire alarms <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> .
Some big companies have teams of in - house experts focusing on safety and business resumption .
Many companies in the path of potential disaster have set up contingency offices in safe regions , hoping they can transport employees there and resume operations quickly .
That means making sure that copies of vital computer software and company records are out of harm 's way .
Some businesses -- like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disneyland</ENAMEX> -- claim that even if they became isolated in a crisis , they would be able to feed and care for their people for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">as long as five days</ENAMEX> .
`` Self - sufficiency has to be the cornerstone of your plan , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephanie Masaki - Schatz</ENAMEX> , manager of corporate emergency planning at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Atlantic Richfield Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
`` If you do n't save your critical people , you wo n't be able to bring up your vital business functions . ''
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ARCO</ENAMEX> 's head office , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 300 miles</ENAMEX> from the epicenter , was n't affected by this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> 's tremors , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masaki - Schatz</ENAMEX> used the occasion to distribute a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> - page memo of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">`` Earthquake Tips ''</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,200</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ARCO</ENAMEX> employees .
`` You need to capitalize on these moments when you have everyone 's attention , '' she says .
`` It was a good reminder that we all need to prepare prior to an event . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ARCO</ENAMEX> memo urges employees to keep certain supplies at work , such as solid shoes and `` heavy gloves to clear debris . ''
It also recommends that employees be aware of everyday office items that could be used for emergency care or shelter .
Among the suggestions : Pantyhose and men 's ties could be used for slings , while removable wooden shelves might aid in `` breaking through office walls . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ARCO</ENAMEX> maintains an office in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> that would take over if payroll operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pasadena</ENAMEX> were disrupted .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two months ago</ENAMEX> the company set up a toll - free number , based outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , to handle queries from employees about when they should report back to work after an earthquake or other disaster .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ARCO</ENAMEX> plan takes into account such details as which aspects of business are busier at certain times of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</ENAMEX> .
This way , depending on when a quake might strike , priorities can be assigned to departments that should be brought back on line <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hewlett - Packard Co.</ENAMEX> , the earthquake came just as the company was reviewing its own emergency procedures .
`` We were talking about scheduling a practice drill for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Tharp</ENAMEX> , a spokeswoman .
`` Then we had a real one in the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</ENAMEX> . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , computer maker scrambled to set up a special phone line to tell manufacturing and support staff to stay home <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> .
Sales and service employees were asked to report to work to help <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Bay area</ENAMEX> clients who called with computer problems .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hewlett - Packard</ENAMEX> also called in its systems experts to restore its own computer operations .
`` That means we can accept orders '' and begin getting back to normal , says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tharp</ENAMEX> .
Prompted by an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake , as well as a fire in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> office tower , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Great Western Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</ENAMEX> hired <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> emergency planners and spent $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">75,000</ENAMEX> equipping a trailer with communications gear to serve as an emergency headquarters .
Although officials of the savings and loan , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Great Western Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> , used some of their new plans and equipment during this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> 's quake , they still lost touch for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">more than 24 hours</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> branches in the affected areas , not knowing if employees were injured or vaults were broken open .
`` Some people flat out did n't know what to do , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert G. Lee</ENAMEX> , vice president for emergency planning and corporate security at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Great Western</ENAMEX> .
As it turned out , bank employees were n't hurt and the vaults withstood the jolts .
Still , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> : `` We need to educate people that they need to get to a phone somehow , some way , to let someone know what their status is . ''
Some companies are confident that they 're prepared .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Occidental Petroleum Corp.</ENAMEX> holds regular evacuation drills and stocks food , oxygen and non-prescription drugs at checkpoints in its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</ENAMEX> - story headquarters .
The company also maintains rechargeable flashlights in offices and changes its standby supply of drinking water <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">every three months</ENAMEX> .
`` We feel we are doing everything we can , '' an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Occidental</ENAMEX> spokesman says .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Walt Disney Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disneyland</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Anaheim</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , stocks rescue equipment , medical supplies , and enough food and water to feed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10,000</ENAMEX> visitors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">as long as five days</ENAMEX> in the event that a calamity isolates the theme park .
The park also has emergency centers where specially trained employees would go to coordinate evacuation and rescue plans using walkie - talkies , cellular phones , and a public - address system .
The centers are complete with maps detailing utility lines beneath rides and `` safe havens '' where people can be assembled away from major structures .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vista Chemical Co.</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> chemical plants in and near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Charles</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La.</ENAMEX> , `` prepares for every hurricane that enters <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Gulf of Mexico</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith L. Fogg</ENAMEX> , a company safety director .
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Atlantic</ENAMEX> storm , did n't affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vista</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> other major storms have threatened operations so far <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , most recently <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Jerry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> .
Because hurricanes can change course rapidly , the company sends employees home and shuts down operations in stages -- the closer a storm gets , the more complete the shutdown .
The company does n't wait until <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the final hours</ENAMEX> to get ready for hurricanes .
`` There are just tons of things that have to be considered , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fogg</ENAMEX> says .
`` Empty tank cars will float away on you if you get a big tidal surge . ''
Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vista</ENAMEX> officials realize they 're relatively fortunate .
`` With a hurricane you know it 's coming .
You have time to put precautionary mechanisms in place , '' notes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vista</ENAMEX> spokeswoman .
`` A situation like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> is so frightening because there 's no warning .
