<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> they get us to buy computers so we can get more information .
Then the computers give us more information than we can ever read .
Now they plan to sell us products that sift through all the information to give us what we really want to know .
The products range from computer - edited , personal newsletters to systems that sit inside a personal computer and pick stories on selected topics off news wires .
`` Filtered news is what people want , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Esther Dyson</ENAMEX> , editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Release 1.0</ENAMEX> , an industry newsletter that spots new developments .
`` Most people read <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> times more than necessary in order to find out what they really need . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geoffrey Goodfellow</ENAMEX> , who dropped out of high school back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</ENAMEX> to manage a computer network at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> research firm , says : `` Old network hands have started to turn off the network because they do n't have time to wade through the muck . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodfellow</ENAMEX> has started a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Menlo Park</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , company called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Anterior Technology</ENAMEX> that provides human editors for public electronic networks .
`` I see it as a sewage treatment plant , '' he says .
A new product , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NewsEdge</ENAMEX> , carries <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> business news wires simultaneously into a user 's computer and beeps and flashes whenever an article appears that is of interest to the user .
The product , developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Desktop Data Corp.</ENAMEX> , a new company based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waltham</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , scans the wires looking for articles that contain key words specified by the user .
One early user , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Semmel</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> venture capitalist and investor in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Desktop Data</ENAMEX> , says he uses it to track takeover developments .
He says he told <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NewsEdge</ENAMEX> to look for stories containing such words as takeover , acquisition , acquire , LBO , tender , merger , junk and halted .
`` I 'm pretty confident I 'm catching everything , '' he says .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NewsEdge</ENAMEX> is pricey : $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">7,500</ENAMEX> a year for a limited version , $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">40,000</ENAMEX> a year if the cost of all the news wires is included .
And it works best in high - powered personal computers .
But some investors and consultants who have tried it are enthusiastic .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Tarter</ENAMEX> , editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SoftLetter</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Watertown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , industry newsletter , says : `` I 've seen a lot of people fooling around on the fringes of filtering information .
This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time I 've seen something I could imagine a lot of people using . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NewsEdge</ENAMEX> uses an FM radio band to carry news wires provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Reuters</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McGraw - Hill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow Jones -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PR Newswire</ENAMEX> , which carries corporate press releases .
An FM receiver attached to a user 's personal computer receives the information .
Some organizations have devised their own systems to sort through news wire items as they come in .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Goodwin</ENAMEX> , an account manager at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Royal Bank of Canada</ENAMEX> , adapted a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lotus Development Corp.</ENAMEX> program called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Agenda</ENAMEX> to sort through international news wires .
It automatically selects stories from particular countries for reading by the international bankers responsible for lending in those areas .
For those who do n't need their personalized information moment by moment , some services are offering overnight newsletters .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Individual Inc.</ENAMEX> , a new company in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brookline</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , uses filtering technology developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cornell University</ENAMEX> computer scientist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerard Salton</ENAMEX> , to automatically produce customized newsletters it sends electronically to subscribers by <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">8 a.m.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</ENAMEX> .
`` We are operating an information refinery that takes a broad stream of raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yosi Amram</ENAMEX> , founder and president .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> newsletter , which is n't widely available yet , will have a base cost of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,000</ENAMEX> a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Reuters</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McGraw Hill</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Press International</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> press release news wires and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kyodo</ENAMEX> news service .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> early user is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NEC Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> printer marketing arm .
`` They want the full press releases on printer announcements by their competition , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amram</ENAMEX> says .
It also tracks personnel and financial announcements by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NEC</ENAMEX> 's distributors and customers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Individual Inc. 's</ENAMEX> technology goes beyond word searches by using a computerized thesaurus .
If a customer asks for stories about `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> , '' the computer will also supply stories that mention `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">I.B.M.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Business Machines</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Blue</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amram</ENAMEX> says .
Moreover , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Individual Inc. 's</ENAMEX> computers can weigh the value of an article based on how closely the story matches the subscriber 's interest area .
It compares the position of key words in the story ; words in the headline or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> paragraph get a higher value .
And it calculates how often the words appear in the story compared with how often they appear in the entire data base .
The higher the ratio of hits to total words , the higher the presumed value to the reader .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pinpoint Information Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chantilly</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX> , a producer of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,800</ENAMEX> - a - year personalized newsletters about the computer industry that started full operation <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> , relies on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> human readers to code news releases by topic in order to select items for each subscriber .
`` The computers find all the key words they can , but the editors confirm every one .
Computer picking is n't perfect , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey Golomb</ENAMEX> , president and founder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pinpoint</ENAMEX> .
The humans also write abstracts of articles from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 200</ENAMEX> computer industry publications .
Once all the articles are coded and put in a data base , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pinpoint</ENAMEX> 's computers pick the most relevant for each subscriber and lay them out in a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three - to - five</ENAMEX> - page newsletter format ; each newsletter is sent directly from the computer to the subscriber 's fax machine .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Golomb</ENAMEX> says each of his computers can produce and send <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 75</ENAMEX> unique newsletters a night .
Many computer network users who never see news wires would like to sort through their electronic mail automatically .
So - called E-mail is the collection of inter-office memos , gossip , technical data , schedules and directives distributed over local and national computer networks .
`` All these interconnected computers make it difficult to sort out what 's junk and what 's important , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuck Digate</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lotus Development</ENAMEX> executive who has started a new company to cope with the problem .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Digate</ENAMEX> says his firm , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Beyond Inc.</ENAMEX> , has licensed technology known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Information Lens</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> and plans to develop it for commercial use .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MIT</ENAMEX> project devised ways for E-mail to be automatically categorized as top priority if it comes from certain designated senders or requires action in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next couple of days</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Digate</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Beyond</ENAMEX> will refine the product `` so the message will be smart enough to know to come back and bother you again <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> . ''
And if a user is busy , `` he can set it for crisis mode : ` Do n't bother me with reports until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> . ' ''
A program called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Notes</ENAMEX> , which is under development by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lotus</ENAMEX> , also is designed to sort E-mail sent within work groups .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> thing that makes E-mail difficult to sift through is that each item looks the same .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Notes</ENAMEX> , which is designed for advanced computers that display graphics , allows mail senders to put different logos on their mail .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> news briefing from the company librarian , for example , would have a distinctive format on the screen , just as a paper version would have .
`` With E-mail , you do n't have the visual clues of paper , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tarter</ENAMEX> , the editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SoftLetter</ENAMEX> .
`` With <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Notes</ENAMEX> , they 're visually distinct .
