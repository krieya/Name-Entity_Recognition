<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Korean</ENAMEX> car exports have slid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40 %</ENAMEX> so far this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> , but auto makers here are n't panicking .
They are enjoying domestic sales that are more than making up for lost overseas sales .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South Korean</ENAMEX> consumers are expected to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 500,000</ENAMEX> passenger cars <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> .
In fact , some auto executives suggest that slackened demand for their cars in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> is a blessing ; otherwise they would n't be able to keep up with demand in the more profitable local market .
`` We are very lucky to easily change an export loss to domestic plus , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hong Tu Pyo</ENAMEX> , managing director of domestic marketing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hyundai Motor Co</ENAMEX> .
As it is , waiting lists of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</ENAMEX> are n't unusual for popular models .
Demand is so strong that all of the domestic makers -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hyundai</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kia Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daewoo Motor Co.</ENAMEX> and even upstart <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SsangYong Motor Co.</ENAMEX> -- plan to build more factories .
Industry analysts predict that by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> will be building <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three million</ENAMEX> cars a year -- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</ENAMEX> of that for export .
It 's an optimistic move in a industry already facing world - wide overcapacity .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South Korean</ENAMEX> auto makers are confident that the export market will bounce back and that demand in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> will stay strong .
Currently <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South Koreans</ENAMEX> owns a car , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade ago</ENAMEX> .
`` In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2000</ENAMEX> it will be <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> car per family .
At that point domestic sales will slow down , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim Yoon Kwon</ENAMEX> , director of marketing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daewoo Motor</ENAMEX> .
The reason for the tremendous demand is simple : <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South Koreans</ENAMEX> suddenly have a lot more money .
`` We never thought we 'd own a car , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kwang Ok Kyong</ENAMEX> , who just bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daewoo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LeMans</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year</ENAMEX> loan .
She and her husband started a small printing business and need the car for work as well as for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</ENAMEX> jaunts .
Pay raises of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</ENAMEX> have given many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South Koreans</ENAMEX> the money to enjoy the things they were supplying the rest of the world .
The success of newcomer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SsangYong Motor</ENAMEX> shows the strength of the auto market and its growing diversity .
A part of the construction - oriented conglomerate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SsangYong Group</ENAMEX> , it took over the dying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dong - A Motor Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SsangYong</ENAMEX> began making variations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jeep</ENAMEX> - like `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Korando</ENAMEX> '' vehicle .
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dong - A</ENAMEX> had had a technology agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jeep</ENAMEX> maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> , now a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler Corp</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
The most popular style is the stretched `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Family</ENAMEX> , '' which resembles a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bronco</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chevy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Blazer</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - wheel - drive vehicles start at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">15,000</ENAMEX> ; a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Family</ENAMEX> can cost <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $ 25,000</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SsangYong</ENAMEX> , which has <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 3 %</ENAMEX> of the domestic market , will sell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 18,000</ENAMEX> of its models <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , twice as many as <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
It sees sales rising <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26,000</ENAMEX> units <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
The company plans to expand plant capacity <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> .
By then it also hopes to begin producing a passenger car based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Volvo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">240</ENAMEX> and selling for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 20,000</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hyundai</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daewoo</ENAMEX> seem unconcerned about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SsangYong</ENAMEX> threat , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kia</ENAMEX> , the scrappy <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL" S_OFF="3">No.3</ENAMEX> auto maker , is selling <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - wheel - drive vehicles through its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> unit .
It plans to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,700</ENAMEX> units in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kia</ENAMEX> , the only <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Korean</ENAMEX> car maker that has seen its overseas sales grow in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> , aims at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> 's common man .
Its advantage has been the peppy little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pride</ENAMEX> , sold as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Festiva</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.8 million won</ENAMEX> , or $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5,700</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">econobox</ENAMEX> is the lowest - priced car in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> .
Along with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> larger models , the company claims <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 %</ENAMEX> of the domestic market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mazda Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> have equity interests in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kia</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kia</ENAMEX> is the most aggressive of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Korean</ENAMEX> Big Three in offering financing .
Loans for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">as long as five years</ENAMEX> make the cars very accessible , with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> payments <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as low as 80,000 won</ENAMEX> , or $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">120</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daewoo Motor</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 - 50</ENAMEX> joint venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daewoo Group</ENAMEX> conglomerate , is the only auto maker that appears to be hurting .
Shipments of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lemans</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pontiac</ENAMEX> division are off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 65 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</ENAMEX> , versus a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 %</ENAMEX> decline for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hyundai</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 %</ENAMEX> increase for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kia</ENAMEX> .
Moreover , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daewoo</ENAMEX> 's domestic sales have grown <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> as fast as sales of its rivals .
The big problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daewoo</ENAMEX> , which holds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 21 %</ENAMEX> of the market , is the long series of labor disruptions it suffered <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daewoo</ENAMEX> is expanding too .
In fact , a sister company , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery</ENAMEX> , plans to build <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240,000</ENAMEX> minicars by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1990s</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hyundai</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Korean</ENAMEX> market leader with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58 %</ENAMEX> share , also plans to jump into minicars at the same time .
It has a similar project for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</ENAMEX> cars a year .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kia</ENAMEX> is reportedly also considering such a plan .
Even giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Samsung Group</ENAMEX> is rumored in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Korean</ENAMEX> press to be considering getting into the auto - making business ; a company spokesman had no comment .
