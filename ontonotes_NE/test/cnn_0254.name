We are watching activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> .
While we do , we want to tell you <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Marines</ENAMEX> battling for control of the bridges in the southern city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nasiriyah</ENAMEX> face stiff resistance from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> paramilitary groups <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
For some perspective , let 's turn to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles O'Brien</ENAMEX> with retired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Air Force</ENAMEX> General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Shepperd</ENAMEX> .
Thank you very much .
If you are going to fight on the ground , you have to encounter bridges somewhere along the way .
A lot of bridges between where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the 3 7 Cavalry</ENAMEX> and the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> forces are now and their ultimate destination , downtown Baghdad .
We have the city laid out for you here .
How many bridges in this city alone ?
In this map we have right here , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</ENAMEX> major bridges in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> , including the expressway bridge over here .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> bridges here attaching <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Baghdad</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Baghdad</ENAMEX> and the palace area .
This is one technique , one possible way <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> forces might seize a bridge , a bridge that might be defended by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> .
Let 's look at the animation .
Typical scenario there .
It does n't really matter for this scenario that we 're laying out here .
This would be representing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M1 - A1</ENAMEX> tanks coming towards the bridge firing .
You have to bundle up and line up to go across that bridge .
Makes it vulnerable to fire from the other side .
Potentially chemical weapons , too .
As we turn the other direction , what you 'll see are these <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> tanks that are kind of fortified there .
They have burns in front of them , artillery behind them firing back .
And then they there goes the smoke screen .
The idea of the smoke screen is to obscure the oncoming forces firing at you from being able to see .
It does n't work , though .
It works both ways .
It obscures you but also obscures them .
Here 's an f .
He comes in and wants to identify his target and he 's got a big --
Ca n't see through the smoke .
We 've got some techniques we 're going to show you .
Somewhere near we can put down special --
