<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> who favor cutting the capital - gains tax are n't ready to line up behind the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> proposal .
Their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital - gains cut , which has had a roller - coaster existence since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the year</ENAMEX> , when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> .
Nevertheless , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Packwood</ENAMEX> , the ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> member on the tax - writing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</ENAMEX> introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure authorizing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> aid for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> -RRB- was confident he had enough votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds , perhaps as soon as <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> all but conceded defeat , telling Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> : `` I sense at this stage you may have the votes . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> lawmakers sparred in a highly personal fashion , violating usual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> decorum .
Their tone was good - natured , with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> saying he intended to offer the proposal again and again on future legislation and Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> saying he intended to use procedural means to block it again and again .
Although the proposal , authored by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> and Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Roth</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Del.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , appears to have general backing by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> , their votes are n't sufficient to pass it .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> , who are under increasing pressure from their leaders to reject the gains - tax cut , are finding reasons to say no , at least for now .
A major reason is that they believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> - Roth plan would lose buckets of revenue over the long run .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> - Roth proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held .
It also would create a new individual retirement account that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes , including retirement , medical expenses , first - home purchases and tuition .
`` A number of us are not going to touch capital gains , IRAs or anything else unless it contributes to deficit - reduction , '' said Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Robb</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , who is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 to 20</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> who the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration believes might favor giving preferential treatment to capital gains .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two days</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> senators at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> .
And at a luncheon meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> senators , there was outspoken opposition to cutting the capital - gains tax <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , according to participants .
The trend is making advocates of the tax cut less optimistic about success .
`` There is a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - out - of - three shot of getting it <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , '' said Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> , a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> proponent of cutting the capital - gains tax .
He called the battle `` uphill . ''
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> who favor a capital - gains cut are even more pessimistic .
`` There will be no capital - gains bill <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , '' said Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Bumpers</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ark .</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
`` I 'm probably not going to vote for any capital - gains proposal .
The IRA portion -LRB- of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> - Roth plan -RRB- is irresponsible . ''
Another significant factor in the capitalgains debate is the extent to which it has become a purely political battle between President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> has made clear to his wavering colleagues that the issue is important to him personally .
Today , Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> and other leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to bash the proposal .
Estimates requested by Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Congressional Joint Taxation Committee</ENAMEX> show that the richest <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital - gains differential of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13 million</ENAMEX> each in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last year</ENAMEX> for which figures are available .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> officials acknowledged <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> still are reluctant to publicly express support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> - Roth capital gains proposal because they are loath to buck Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> .
As a result , the officials said they are open to making a variety of deals with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> to win their support for a capital - gains tax cut .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> asked in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> for discussions with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> have suggested ways of `` tinkering '' with the Packwood - Roth proposal , suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version they can back , one official said .
In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> aides think that there are numerous other important measures <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> badly wanted passed -- such as the scaling back of a controversial catastrophic health - care plan for the elderly -- that might provide the president leverage in cutting deals with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> .
A capital - gains tax cut might be paired with such measures to help ensure passage .
Other possibilities include a child - care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage .
If they ca n't secure immediate passage of a capital - gains plan , administration officials also are n't ruling out making a deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> to put off a vote until a firm date in the future , even <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
But the officials insist that such a deal on a future vote would have to apply to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> .

<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> immigration authorities said they found <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">658</ENAMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> boat people , bringing the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> trying to enter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> by posing as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> refugees <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,642</ENAMEX> .

The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> were among <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,372</ENAMEX> boat people supposedly from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> who arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">219</ENAMEX> for all of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , the official said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">658</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> , who have been in a refugee - assistance center , were sent to immigration facilities <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> pending deportation to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , the official said .

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francoise Verne</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">52 - year - old</ENAMEX> former deputy director of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> 's mint , faces prison for her theft of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 67</ENAMEX> rare coins from the mint 's collections .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</ENAMEX> in command <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1979 to 1984</ENAMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verne</ENAMEX> told a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> court that the `` great disorder '' that reigned at the agency led her into temptation .
Before an inventory in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> that showed the `` disappearance '' of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">944</ENAMEX> coins valued at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 2.9 million French francs</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 465,000</ENAMEX> -RRB- , there had n't been any stock - taking since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Lambert</ENAMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verne</ENAMEX> 's successor , says the mint 's losses from the theft run into <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">the hundreds of thousands of francs</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX> is destroying <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 1.6 million pounds</ENAMEX> of food that had rotted in government warehouses , government officials said .
The state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supply Regulator Institute</ENAMEX> is to burn rice , corn and beans that spoiled because of neglect and corruption in the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christian Democrat</ENAMEX> government , a statement from the information service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SISAL</ENAMEX> said .
During the past administration the foodstuffs were first bought by the institute , then sold at low prices to `` unscrupulous businessmen '' who resold them to the institute at inflated prices , the statement said .

Another <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Libyans</ENAMEX> were already in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> to stage a day of mourning for victims of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> 's colonial rule <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1911 and 1943</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tripoli</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> kidnapped <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Libyans</ENAMEX> and deported them as forced labor .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX> 's revolutionary Committees have threatened attacks on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Italians</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> does n't pay compensation .
But officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> say the issue was legally resolved by a settlement between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> and King <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Idris</ENAMEX> , deposed by Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muammar Gadhafi</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</ENAMEX> .

The action , in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Canadian Federal Court</ENAMEX> , will be against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Netherlands</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , the ministry spokesman said .

The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> city council is battling plans to tap huge gas fields off the coast that it says will speed up the city 's slow sinking into its lagoon .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AGIP</ENAMEX> , the state - owned energy giant , made the announcement about the gas field <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> .
Located <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six miles</ENAMEX> northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> , the field contains <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">875 billion cubic feet</ENAMEX> of methane gas - <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one - tenth</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> 's reserves .
Alarmed councilors say the project could jeopardize costly efforts to stop , or slow down , the subsidence that makes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> subject to regular and destructive flooding .
The council unanimously opposed the idea of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AGIP</ENAMEX> pumping out the methane gas and swiftly appealed to the company and to Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giulio Andreotti</ENAMEX> , who has yet to reply .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AGIP</ENAMEX> refused to reconsider and says drilling is due to start <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early next year</ENAMEX> .
