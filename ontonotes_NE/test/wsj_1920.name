<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The White House</ENAMEX> is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly .
In the aftermath of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake - related activity <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> .
Some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims , but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">a White House</ENAMEX> in action .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Exxon Valdez</ENAMEX> oil tanker split open in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Alaskan</ENAMEX> waters and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> struck the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Carolina</ENAMEX> coast , and they clearly do n't want a repeat of those charges <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">now</ENAMEX> .
So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> announced that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> got his first earthquake briefing of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">6:30 a.m.</ENAMEX> from chief of staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sununu</ENAMEX> .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> had taken two phone calls from Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX> , who was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> ; made a televised statement of concern ; signed a disaster proclamation ; received a written report from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Emergency Management Agency</ENAMEX> ; and visited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FEMA</ENAMEX> headquarters .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aides were trying to head off criticism .
On his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FEMA</ENAMEX> visit , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said that he hoped there would be `` less carping '' about the emergency office 's performance this time , adding that the agency `` took a hit '' for its reaction to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The White House</ENAMEX> already is talking of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake site <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</ENAMEX> .
He visited the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX> devastation but not until after local leaders urged him to do so .
