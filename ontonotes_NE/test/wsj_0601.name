In an age of specialization , the federal judiciary is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the last bastions of the generalist .
A judge must jump from murder to antitrust cases , from arson to securities fraud , without missing a beat .
But even on the federal bench , specialization is creeping in , and it has become a subject of sharp controversy on the newest federal appeals court .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</ENAMEX> was created in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> to serve , among other things , as the court of last resort for most patent disputes .
Previously , patent cases moved through the court system to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> circuit appeals courts .
There , judges who saw few such cases and had no experience in the field grappled with some of the most technical and complex disputes imaginable .
A new specialty court was sought by patent experts , who believed that the generalists had botched too many important , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">multimillion - dollar</ENAMEX> cases .
Some patent lawyers had hoped that such a specialty court would be filled with experts in the field .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration thought otherwise , and so may the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> , the president has filled <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> vacancies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Circuit</ENAMEX> court with non-patent lawyers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Now</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> judges -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pauline Newman</ENAMEX> , Chief Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard T. Markey</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">68</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giles Rich</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">85</ENAMEX> -- have patent - law backgrounds .
The latter <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> and Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel M. Friedman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</ENAMEX> , are approaching senior status or retirement .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> seats currently are vacant and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> others are likely to be filled within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</ENAMEX> , so patent lawyers and research - based industries are making a new push for specialists to be added to the court .
Several organizations , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Industrial Biotechnical Association</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association</ENAMEX> , have asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justice Department</ENAMEX> to name candidates with both patent and scientific backgrounds .
The associations would like the court to include <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between three and six</ENAMEX> judges with specialized training .
Some of the associations have recommended Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan D. Lourie</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">54</ENAMEX> , a former patent agent with a doctorate in organic chemistry who now is associate general counsel with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SmithKline Beckman Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lourie</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> interviewed him <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last July</ENAMEX> .
Their effort has received a lukewarm response from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> .
`` We do not feel that seats are reserved -LRB- for patent lawyers -RRB- , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justice</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Runkel</ENAMEX> , who declines to say how soon a candidate will be named .
`` But we will take it into consideration . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Justice Department 's</ENAMEX> view is shared by other lawyers and at least <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> member of the court , Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Robert Mayer</ENAMEX> , a former civil litigator who served at the claims court trial level before he was appointed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Circuit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> .
`` I believe that any good lawyer should be able to figure out and understand patent law , '' Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayer</ENAMEX> says , adding that `` it 's the responsibility of highly paid lawyers -LRB- who argue before the court -RRB- to make us understand -LRB- complex patent litigation -RRB- . ''
Yet some lawyers point to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eli Lilly -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Medtronic , Inc.</ENAMEX> , the patent infringement case <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</ENAMEX> agreed to review , as an example of poor legal reasoning by judges who lack patent litigation experience .
-LRB- Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayer</ENAMEX> was not on the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> - member panel . -RRB-
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lilly</ENAMEX> case , the appeals court broadly construed a federal statute to grant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Medtronic</ENAMEX> , a medical device manufacturer , an exemption to infringe a patent under certain circumstances .
If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> holds in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Medtronic</ENAMEX> 's favor , the decision will have <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion - dollar</ENAMEX> consequences for the manufacturers of medical devices , color and food additives and all other non-drug products that required <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Food -AMP- Drug Administration</ENAMEX> approval .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Raines</ENAMEX> , a lawyer and director of government relations for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Industrial Biotechnical Association</ENAMEX> , contends that a judge well - versed in patent law and the concerns of research - based industries would have ruled otherwise .
And Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newman</ENAMEX> , a former patent lawyer , wrote in her dissent when the court denied a motion for a rehearing of the case by the full court , `` The panel 's judicial legislation has affected an important high - technological industry , without regard to the consequences for research and innovation or the public interest . ''
Says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raines</ENAMEX> , `` -LRB- The judgment -RRB- confirms our concern that the absence of patent lawyers on the court could prove troublesome .
