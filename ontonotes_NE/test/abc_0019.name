Back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> .
the truce brokered by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> allegedly is in tatters .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> now talking about a battle for independence .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> says it may abandon the peace negotiations altogether .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> were killed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 70</ENAMEX> people have been wounded , mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> , but also several <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> soldiers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Woodruff</ENAMEX> is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> territories <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> .
Violence ripped through almost every major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> town <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
The worst was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nablus</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> were shot and killed .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ramallah</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> rushed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> checkpoint , then faced down <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> guns .
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hebron</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaza</ENAMEX> , the wounded were carried off so fast it was difficult to count them .
As is so often the case , much of the trouble started with funerals that escalated into fury .
Most significant , demonstrators who had been throwing stones <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> turned to gasoline bombs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> who had been firing rubber bullets stepped up their use of real ones .
This was supposed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> the truce went into effect , when both sides would call off the violence , but that clearly has not happened , and here in the streets , peace seems very unlikely .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Tonight</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> television , Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> said we can not go on as if nothing happened , and if the demonstrations do n't stop , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> 's spokesman said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> will continue to use live ammunition .
They leave no other way for us but to respond with fire , we 'll have to do this .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> leaders said their people no longer want a cease - fire , they want their own country .
We are under occupation and subjugation .
The question should be what the Hosni Mubarak are they still doing there <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years after</ENAMEX> the peace process began .
It is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the major questions that was supposed to be addressed after the stoning and shooting had stopped .
It certainly has not stopped .
Not yet .
