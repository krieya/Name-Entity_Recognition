The more than <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,000</ENAMEX> workers that this group used to have were all bought out .
Only some <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">700</ENAMEX> people work at the reorganized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cinda Changlin Group</ENAMEX> .
The rest of them have all scattered in limbo as they search for a way to make a living .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2005</ENAMEX> , they themselves have had to renew insurances by themselves .
For the costs of retirement and health insurances at current levels , each person has to pay about <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,000 yuan</ENAMEX> per year .
Where can they go to get the money ?
This month <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jiangxi Province</ENAMEX> increased pension payments to the retirees , but all the indispensable living costs that a person needs to pay for have started to rise accordingly in the markets .
The government 's " average wage " level is going to rise again , so next year the costs of retirement and health insurances that laid - off workers have to pay for will rise again .
Even for those laid - off workers who can find work , are private companies going to give them higher wages ?
And how are those who can not find jobs going to make a living ?
Has the government thought about this ?
If there are problems in the future , who will then be the one breaking the " law " ?
