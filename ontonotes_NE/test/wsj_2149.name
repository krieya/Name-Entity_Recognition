a tragicomic monologue by an idealistic , not unheroic , though sadly self - deceived <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">English</ENAMEX> butler in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">his sixties</ENAMEX> -- proceeds as if the realistic <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">English</ENAMEX> novel of manners , like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britannia</ENAMEX> herself , still ruled the waves .
In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kazuo Ishiguro 's</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Remains of the Day</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Knopf</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">245</ENAMEX> pages , $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">18.95</ENAMEX> -RRB- is both an homage to traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">English</ENAMEX> forms and a dramatic critique of them .
It implies that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the British Empire</ENAMEX> was rooted in its subjects ' minds , manners and morals , and argues , tacitly , that its self - destructive flaws were embodied in the defensive snobbery , willful blindness , role - playing and especially the locutions of its domestic servants .
As the narrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> , the solitary butler of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Darlington Hall</ENAMEX> , mulls over such hallowed terms as `` greatness , '' `` dignity , '' `` service '' and `` loyalty , '' we see how pious cant subverts the soul .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> 's dutiful conflation of the public and private realms -- like his beloved master 's -- destroys all it was designed to preserve .
Such armor crushes the soldier .
The mask cuts to the quick .
It 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Suez</ENAMEX> crisis marked the final end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> .
As he stands on a hill at the beginning of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - day</ENAMEX> motor expedition from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oxfordshire</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cornwall</ENAMEX> , where a former housekeeper resides , perhaps the victim of an unhappy <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 - year</ENAMEX> marriage , perhaps -LRB- he hopes with more fervor than he will ever acknowledge -RRB- not disinclined to return to domestic service , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> surveys the view and thereby provides a self - portrait , a credo and the author 's metaphor for the aesthetic of the novel we 're reading :
`` We call this land of ours <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Britain</ENAMEX> , and there may be those who believe this a somewhat immodest practice .
Yet I would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this lofty adjective ... .
It is the very lack of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart .
What is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty , its sense of restraint .
It is as though the land knows of its own beauty , of its own greatness , and feels no need to shout it .
In comparison , the sorts of sights offered in such places as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , though undoubtedly very exciting , would , I am sure , strike the objective viewer as inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness . ''
An effusive landscape ?
An ill - mannered mountain ?
But let <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> continue in his unwitting comic manner -LRB- his conscious efforts at `` banter '' always fail -- most comically -RRB- : `` This whole question is very akin to the question that has caused much debate in our profession over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</ENAMEX> : what is a ` great ' butler ? ''
His answer is one `` possessed of a dignity in keeping with his position . ''
Such dignity `` has to do crucially with a butler 's ability not to abandon the professional being he inhabits . ''
He `` will not be shaken out by external events , however surprising , alarming or vexing ... .
Continentals are unable to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">English</ENAMEX> race are capable of . ''
Despite his racial advantage , to be a great butler is a heroic calling ; one 's pantry is `` not unlike general 's headquarters during a battle . ''
If , for example , in the midst of a great social occasion -LRB- such as an international conference on revising <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Versailles Treaty</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</ENAMEX> -RRB- , one 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">72-yearold</ENAMEX> father , himself a great butler once , should happen to die of a stroke , one must continue to serve the port : `` Please do n't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment .
You see , I know my father would have wished me to carry on just now . ''
It is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> to declare : `` For all its sad associations , whenever I recall <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">that evening</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , I find I do so with a large sense of triumph . ''
We note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow .
That <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> himself is not grotesque or repellent , but funny and sad and enlightening , is entirely the author 's triumph .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ishiguro</ENAMEX> 's ability to create a fallible narrative voice that permits him to explore such intertwining domestic , cultural and political themes was abundantly clear in his previous novel , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">An Artist of the Floating World</ENAMEX> , '' set in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> after the war .
Now shifting his scene from the country he left at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> he has lived in for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly 30 years</ENAMEX> , he has fashioned a novel in the mode of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry James</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.M. Forster</ENAMEX> .
With great aplomb he considers not only filial devotion and -LRB- utterly repressed -RRB- sexual love , but <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> anti-Semitism , the gentry 's impatience with democracy and support of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> , and the moral problematics of loyalty : `` It is , in practice , simply not possible to adopt such a critical attitude towards an employer and at the same time provide good service ... .
` This employer embodies all that I find noble and admirable .
I will hereafter devote myself to serving him .
' This is loyalty intelligently bestowed . ''
In the end , after meeting with the former housekeeper , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> sits by the seashore at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">dusk</ENAMEX> , thinking of her and of his employer , and declares `` I trusted .
I trusted in his lordship 's wisdom ... .
I ca n't even say I made my own mistakes .
Really -- one has to ask oneself -- what dignity is there in that ? ''
The loyal servant has come full circle .
What is greatness ?
What is dignity ?
We understand such rueful wisdom must be retrospective : The owl of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minerva</ENAMEX> only spreads her wings at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">dusk</ENAMEX> .
But as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Remains of the Day</ENAMEX> '' so eloquently demonstrates with quiet virtuosity , such wisdom can be movingly embodied in art .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX> teaches English and comparative literature at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbia University</ENAMEX> .
