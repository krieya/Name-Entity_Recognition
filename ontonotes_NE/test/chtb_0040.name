<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Xinhua News Agency</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 5th</ENAMEX> , by reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guocheng Jiang</ENAMEX>
" <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Five years ago</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's digital telephone program - controlled switch market was monopolized by various brands of foreign products , we worried about whether <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> could successfully develop digital program - controlled switches .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , domestically produced high - performance telephone program - controlled telephone switches already account for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36 %</ENAMEX> of the domestic market share . "
" When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Meteorological Bureau</ENAMEX> bought mainframe computers from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cray Inc.</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , it just sold us <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> processors .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , the maximum computing speed of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">' Dawn 1000 '</ENAMEX> computer we developed ourselves has already reached <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5 billion</ENAMEX> operations per second , exceeding the speed of the computer sold to us by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cray Inc.</ENAMEX> "
This is part of the speech delivered at the working meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the " 863 Program "</ENAMEX> today by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jian Song</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> council member and concurrently director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Science Commission</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The " 863 Program "</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's high - tech research program , initiated in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> developed countries have always restricted the export of important high - tech products , such as high - performance large - scale digital telephone program - controlled switches and supercomputers , to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jian Song</ENAMEX> said that " <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is capable of producing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10,000</ENAMEX> sets of digital telephone program - controlled switches , and the chief designer of this kind of switch is only <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">28 years old</ENAMEX> , graduating from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wuhan University</ENAMEX> . "
Most of the research staff who successfully developed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">' Dawning 1000 '</ENAMEX> computer <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> are young people <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about 30 years old</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jian Song</ENAMEX> said to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of high - tech experts representatives and science and technology officials attending the meeting : " The series of achievements we have made in the development and industrialization of high - tech help us to further overcome timid thoughts that high - tech is unattainable .
They have greatly enhanced our whole nation 's courage and confidence in realizing socialist modernization . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The " 863 Program "</ENAMEX> , with a total investment of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 billion yuan RMB</ENAMEX> and a duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</ENAMEX> , since its implementation in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> , has gained breakthroughs in a large number of significant key fields of technology .
It has greatly narrowed the gap between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's high - tech and the internationally advanced levels , and has promoted the modernization of civilian industry and the national defense industry .
In the civilian fields of biotechnology , information technology , automation technology , energy technology and new materials technology alone , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1200</ENAMEX> research achievements have been made , of which 560 have reached internationally advanced levels .
This aside , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> has scheduled <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 400</ENAMEX> research projects in the fields of aerospace technology and laser technology , involving space science and application , jumbo carrier rockets , space stations , space shuttle transportation systems , and has made phased achievements in certain key technology fields .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jian Song</ENAMEX> also cited the significant achievements that the internationally advanced level gained in fields such as agricultural biotechnology , biomedicine , genetic engineering , lasers , robotics , etc .
For example , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> developed genetically engineered Hepatitis B vaccine and an " a " interferon for blocking the progress of Hepatitis B have entered the market , which is good news for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120 million</ENAMEX> Hepatitis B virus carriers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
Later stages of Hepatitis B often develop into liver cancer .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> has determined its focus of high - tech research for the coming <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> , and set about drawing up <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next century 's</ENAMEX> high - tech research plans .
Finally , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jian Song</ENAMEX> said , " Whether our own high - tech and its industry can be successful is related to the success or failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's undertaking of modernization , and is related to the rise and fall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> people .
To vigorously develop high - tech and establish a powerful national high - tech industry in our country as soon as possible is an urgent task currently facing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's scientific and technological circles and economic circles . "
