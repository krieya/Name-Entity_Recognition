The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's handicapped sports cause has undergone the several stages of conceptualization , growth and expansion , and is currently rising .
The holding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">6th</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Far East and South Pacific Disabled Games</ENAMEX> will provide more impetus for this trend .
Each development step of handicapped sports can not be separated from the concern and support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Party</ENAMEX> and the government .
At the beginning of the establishment of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the People 's Republic of China</ENAMEX> , social welfare services and schools for blind children and deaf people were established successively everywhere .
Welfare factories developed activities such as broadcast exercises , etc. and schools established physical education .
As a part of the cause for the disabled , disabled sports began to grow .
Every year , the nation allocates special funds to be used in developing handicapped sports activities .
Nationwide handicapped sports games began to be held in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1950's</ENAMEX> .
The games accelerated improvement and drove popularization .
The handicapped sports cause has gradually grown .
Since the reform and opening up , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> economy has developed rapidly .
This enabled more people to put money and material resource into the disabled sports cause .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the short 10 years</ENAMEX> , the cause has achieved success of attention from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and abroad .
It is reasonable to believe that the disabled cause will be increasingly recognized and supported as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's overall national strength escalates .
The handicapped sports cause will also have broad development .
The establishment and healthiness of disabled sports organizations provide organizational assurance for the development of the sports cause for handicapped people .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Chinese Injured and Disabled People Sports Association</ENAMEX> -LRB- renamed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chinese Disabled Sports Association</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> -RRB- was established in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October , 1983</ENAMEX> .
After this a succession of handicapped sports organizations were established throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chinese Mentally Impaired and Blind Sports Associations</ENAMEX> were also established .
Having organization and leadership , activities such as the games and competitions , etc. were increasingly and frequently held .
The enthusiasm of handicapped people participating in the sports activities was unprecedentedly increasing , sports levels continually improve and the reserve force is growing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">National Disabled Games</ENAMEX> were held respectively in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hefei</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tangshan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> .
The scale became larger and larger and the level became higher and higher .
The games have received more broad attention and support of the public , and have attracted more disabled people to take part in the events .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Since 1984</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chinese Disabled Sports Association</ENAMEX> has become a member of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</ENAMEX> international disabled sports organizations successively , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Para Olympic Committee</ENAMEX> , etc. and has established relations with disabled sports organizations in various countries and areas and taken part in international events such as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Special Olympic Games</ENAMEX> , etc .
In competitions and contacts , disabled <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> people have revealed extraordinary physical abilities , achieved excellent results , enhanced friendship with disabled people from various countries and areas and contributed to the development of physical activities for disabled people around the world .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">" The Guaranteed Law for Disabled Persons in the People 's Republic of China "</ENAMEX> , which was drafted and implemented in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> , stipulates to organize and support disabled people to develop mass sports activities , to hold special games and to participate in important international competitions and communication .
The guarantee of the law has and will continue to boost the vigorous development of the sports cause for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's disabled .
Holding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">6th</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Asia - Pacific Special Olympic Games</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> will motivate all of society to better understand and support disabled sports .
It will make the public more conscious of helping disabled people and encourage more disabled people to take part in physical activities .
It will , therefore , greatly assist in the development of the sports cause for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's disabled .
Truly , the foundation of disabled sports in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is not very strong , popularization is not yet widespread , and compared with some developed countries , still has a large gap .
However , the " impact " of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Far South Games</ENAMEX> foreshadows a bright future for this civilized and progressive cause .
