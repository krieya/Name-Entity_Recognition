<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Oakland Athletics '</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - game sweep over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the San Francisco Giants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the World Series</ENAMEX> may widen already - sizable losses that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> network will incur on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the current , final year</ENAMEX> of its baseball contract .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Series</ENAMEX> , disrupted by a devastating earthquake and diminished in national interest because both teams came from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area , is likely to end up as the lowest - rated <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Series</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this decade</ENAMEX> and probably since the event has been broadcast .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> games were seen by an average of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 17 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> homes , a sharp decline from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.7 %</ENAMEX> rating for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Series</ENAMEX> .
A final ratings tally from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">A.C. Nielsen Co.</ENAMEX> is due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
The sweep by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">A's</ENAMEX> , whose pitchers and home - run hitters dominated the injury - prone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Giants</ENAMEX> , will only make things worse for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> , owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capital Cities / ABC Inc</ENAMEX> .
The network had been expected to have losses of as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</ENAMEX> on baseball this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> .
It is n't clear how much those losses may widen because of the short <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Series</ENAMEX> .
Had the contest gone a full <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> games , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> could have reaped an extra <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</ENAMEX> in ad sales on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</ENAMEX> game alone , compared with the ad take it would have received for regular prime - time shows .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> had based its budget for baseball on a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> - game <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Series</ENAMEX> .
A network spokesman would n't comment , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC Sports</ENAMEX> officials declined to be interviewed .
But some industry executives said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> , in anticipation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - game sweep , limited its losses by jacking up the number of commercials it aired in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> games .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Series</ENAMEX> telecast typically carries <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">30 - second</ENAMEX> commercials , but by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> game <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> was cramming in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</ENAMEX> ads to generate extra revenue .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's baseball experience may be of interest to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> , which <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next season</ENAMEX> takes over the broadcasting of all baseball playoffs in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - year</ENAMEX> television contract priced at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.06 billion</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS Sports</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal Pilson</ENAMEX> has conceded only that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> will have a loss in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</ENAMEX> .
But other industry executives contend the losses could reach <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 million</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> and could go even higher if <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the World Series</ENAMEX> end in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - game romps .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Series</ENAMEX> typically is among the highest - rated sports events on television .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">series</ENAMEX> , broadcast by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Electric Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> , was the lowest - rated <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Series</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> ; instead of featuring a major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East Coast</ENAMEX> team against a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West Coast</ENAMEX> team , it pitted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Los Angeles Dodgers</ENAMEX> against the losing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Oakland A's</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's hurdle was even higher <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> teams from the same area .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Series</ENAMEX> got off to a lukewarm start <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 14</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.2 %</ENAMEX> rating ; the next night it drew <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.4 %</ENAMEX> of homes .
Then came the earthquake and a damaging delay of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">11 days</ENAMEX> .
Some people had hoped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's ratings would go up because of the intense focus on the event in the aftermath of the earthquake .
An analyst 's opinion to that effect even sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capital Cities / ABC</ENAMEX> shares soaring <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</ENAMEX> ago .
But interest instead decreased .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> game , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Friday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> , drew a disappointing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.5</ENAMEX> rating .
