The city 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Department of Consumer Affairs</ENAMEX> charged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Newmark -AMP- Lewis Inc.</ENAMEX> with failing to deliver on its promise of lowering prices .
In a civil suit commenced in state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , the agency alleged that the consumer - electronics and appliance discount - retailing chain engaged in deceptive advertising by claiming to have `` lowered every price on every item '' as part of an advertising campaign that began <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1</ENAMEX> .
The agency said it monitored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Newmark -AMP- Lewis 's</ENAMEX> advertised prices before and after the ad campaign , and found that the prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 50</ENAMEX> different items either increased or stayed the same .
In late <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Newmark -AMP- Lewis</ENAMEX> announced a plan to cut prices <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 % to 20 %</ENAMEX> and eliminate what it called a `` standard discount - retailing practice '' of negotiating individual deals with customers .
The consumer agency also disputed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Newmark -AMP- Lewis 's</ENAMEX> continuing strategy of advertising `` new lower prices '' when allgedly there have n't been price reductions since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard D. Lewis</ENAMEX> , president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</ENAMEX> - store chain , defended the company 's pricing campaign , saying it did n't use `` the misleading expression ` reduced from original prices . ' ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> said the company marked price tags and advertised at its `` lowest possible prices '' for all its merchandise to reduce public confusion .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> said the company gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Consumer Affairs</ENAMEX> department `` volumes of documents '' to substantiate its statements , and made `` every effort to comply '' with all the agency 's policies .
In its suit , the consumer agency seeks fines of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> per violation of the city 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Consumer Protection Law</ENAMEX> , costs of investigation , and an injunction to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Newmark -AMP- Lewis</ENAMEX> from continuing its allegedly deceptive advertising .
