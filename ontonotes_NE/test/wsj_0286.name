For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> , a strict regimen governed the staff meetings at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan Motor Co. 's</ENAMEX> technical center in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> 's western suburbs .
Employees wore identification badges listing not only their names but also their dates of hire .
No one could voice an opinion until everybody with more seniority had spoken <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> , so younger employees -- often the most enthusiastic and innovative -- seldom spoke up at all .
But in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> , the badges and the `` do n't speak out of turn '' rule were abolished -- early steps in a cultural revolution still rolling on with all the subtlety of a freight train .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> has instituted flex - time work schedules and allowed employees to dress casually , even in blue jeans .
A rule forbidding staffers to own competitors ' cars has been lifted , and now many designers drive foreign cars to get useful ideas .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</ENAMEX> - old corporate song filled with references to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mount Fuji</ENAMEX> has been scrapped in favor of a snappy tune sung by a popular <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> vocalist .
And in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> recently opened the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> coed company dormitory for single employees at the suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> technical center .
`` We had lots of internal debate about this one , '' concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tadahiko Fukuyama</ENAMEX> , a senior public - relations official .
`` But in the end , top management decided to follow the voice of the younger generation . ''
This corporate glasnost is a big reason <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> , after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> of making lackluster cars and lousy profits , has loosened up its rigid ways and now is riding a string of hits , ranging from the sleek <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maxima</ENAMEX> sedan and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Porsche</ENAMEX> - like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">300ZX</ENAMEX> to the whimsically nostalgic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pao</ENAMEX> , a minicar sold only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
The company 's turnaround is far from complete ; many crucial tests are just beginning .
But its surprising progress so far holds important lessons for companies in trouble .
The big one : A company 's culture ca n't be radically changed unless top management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> admits that things have gone badly awry and then publicly leads the charge .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atsushi Muramatsu</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's executive vice president for finance , helped set the tone in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1986</ENAMEX> , when the company was heading toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> operating loss by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> auto maker since the nation 's postwar recovery .
`` This is a time of self - criticism to discover what is wrong with us , '' he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yutaka Kume</ENAMEX> , who took the helm as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's president in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1985</ENAMEX> , added simply , `` I am deeply disappointed . ''
No wonder .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> - largest auto maker and the world 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> - largest , was getting beat up not only by its bigger rival , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> , but also by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda Motor Co.</ENAMEX> , the most successful <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> car company in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> but a relative pipsqueak in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's market share in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> had been dropping <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the decade</ENAMEX> .
Its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> sales sagged , partly because of price increases due to the rising yen .
Worst of all , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> was preoccupied with management infighting , cronyism and corporate rigidity .
Consider the experience of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satoko Kitada</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year - old</ENAMEX> designer of vehicle interiors who joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> .
At that time , tasks were assigned strictly on the basis of seniority .
`` The oldest designer got to work on the dashboard , '' she recalls .
`` The next level down did doors .
If a new person got to work on part of the speedometer , that was a big deal . ''
This system produced boring , boxy cars that consumers just were n't buying .
Desperately hoping to spark sales , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> transferred <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</ENAMEX> middle managers and plant workers to dealerships .
Meanwhile , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kume</ENAMEX> ordered everyone from top executives to rookie designers to go `` town watching , '' to visit chic parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> to try to gain insights into developing cars for trend - setters .
Some town - watching excursions were downright comic .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> group of middle - aged manufacturing men from the company 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zama</ENAMEX> plant outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> was supposed to check out a trendy restaurant in the city .
But when they arrived at the door , all were afraid to go in , fearing that they would be out of place .
Other trips were more productive .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kume</ENAMEX> himself visited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda</ENAMEX> 's headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> 's upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Aoyama district</ENAMEX> .
He liked the well - lighted lobby display of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda</ENAMEX> 's cars and trucks so much that he had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's gloomy lobby exhibit refurbished .
Later , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> borrowed other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda</ENAMEX> practices , including an engineering `` idea contest '' to promote inventiveness .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> engineer developed a `` crab car '' that moves sideways .
Such sudden cultural shifts may come across as a bit forced , but they seem to be genuine -- so much so , in fact , that some older employees have resisted .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> handled the die - hards in a typically <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> fashion : They were n't fired but instead `` were neglected , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kouji Hori</ENAMEX> , the personnel manager at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Nissan Technical Center</ENAMEX> .
Despite the pain of adjusting , the cultural revolution has begun to yield exciting cars .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A year ago</ENAMEX> , the company completely revamped its near - luxury sedan , the $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">17,699</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maxima</ENAMEX> , which competes against a broad range of upscale sedans ; it replaced its boxy , pug - nosed body with sleek , aerodynamic lines .
Since then , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> also has launched new versions of the $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">13,249</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">240SX</ENAMEX> sporty coupe and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">300ZX</ENAMEX> sports car .
The restyled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">300ZX</ENAMEX> costs <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 33,000</ENAMEX> and is squared off against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Porche</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">944</ENAMEX> , which begins at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">41,900</ENAMEX> .
Besides new styling , the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissans</ENAMEX> have more powerful engines and more sophisticated suspension systems .
All <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> new models are outselling their predecessors by wide margins .
In its home market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> has grabbed attention with limited - production minicars featuring styling odd enough to be cute .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pao</ENAMEX> , a tiny coupe with a peelback canvas top and tilted headlights that give it a droopy - eyed look .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> initially planned to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 10,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Paos</ENAMEX> , but sales have passed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</ENAMEX> , and there 's a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one - year</ENAMEX> waiting list for the car .
Then , there 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the S - Cargo</ENAMEX> , an offbeat delivery van with a snail - like body that inspired its name .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> helped develop a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> restaurant with both vehicles as its design theme .
The chairs are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S - Cargo</ENAMEX> seats , and a gift shop sells such items as alarm clocks styled like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pao</ENAMEX> 's oversized speedometer .
All these vehicles have sharply improved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's morale and image -- but have n't done much for its market share .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> car market in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> before beginning a depressing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eight - year</ENAMEX> slide that continued through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
Strong sales so far <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> are certain to turn the tide , but even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</ENAMEX> market share that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> expects in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> will leave it far below its position at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the decade</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> concedes that it wo n't recoup all its market - share losses in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> until at least <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> , and even that timetable might prove optimistic .
`` Everyone else is going to catch up '' with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's innovative designs , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Rama Krishna</ENAMEX> , auto analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Boston -LRB- Japan -RRB- Ltd</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's pace of new - model hits will slow , he adds , just as arch - rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota</ENAMEX> unleashes its own batch of new cars .
Likewise , in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> has grabbed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.2 %</ENAMEX> of the car market so far this year , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.5 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</ENAMEX> .
But even that brings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> only to the share it had in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , and leaves the company behind its high of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> .
Why ?
So far , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's new - model successes are mostly specialized vehicles with limited sales potential .
In compact and subcompact cars , the bread - and - butter sales generators for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> auto makers , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> still trails <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> hopes that that will start to change <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</ENAMEX> , with its new version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stanza</ENAMEX> compact sedan .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stanza</ENAMEX> has been a nonentity compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda</ENAMEX> 's hugely successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accord</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Camry</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda</ENAMEX> has revamped the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accord</ENAMEX> and made it a midsized car .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> instead has kept its new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stanza</ENAMEX> a bit smaller than that and cut the base price <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</ENAMEX> ; at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">11,450</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stanza</ENAMEX> prices start $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">749</ENAMEX> below the predecessor model yet have a more - powerful engine .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accord</ENAMEX> prices start at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">12,345</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's risk is that its low - base - price strategy might get lost amid the highly publicized rebates being offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> 's Big Three .
But `` on a new car , a rebate does n't work well '' because it cheapens the vehicle 's image , contends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas D. Mignanelli</ENAMEX> , executive vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> sales arm .
Even if the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stanza</ENAMEX> succeeds , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> will remain behind in the subcompact segment , where its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sentra</ENAMEX> does n't measure up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Civic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corolla</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> will introduce a completely revamped <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sentra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next fall</ENAMEX> .
At the opposite end of the market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> launches its luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Infiniti</ENAMEX> division on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 8</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda</ENAMEX> pioneered <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> luxury cars and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> went on sale .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> started advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Infiniti</ENAMEX> fully <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eight months</ENAMEX> before the cars hit <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> showrooms .
The ads featured fences , rocks and pussy - willow buds -- almost anything but the cars themselves .
The ads have generated some laughs but also plenty of attention because they are so unlike any other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto advertising .
On the other hand , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's sales goals for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Infiniti</ENAMEX> are modest compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota</ENAMEX> 's targets for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> will build <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 3,500</ENAMEX> of the $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">38,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Infiniti</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Q45</ENAMEX> sedans each month , sending <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,000</ENAMEX> of them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and keeping the rest for sale in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota</ENAMEX> wants to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 49,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LS400</ENAMEX> sedans <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> alone .
`` When I saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> sales projections , I got worried , '' confesses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takashi Oka</ENAMEX> , who led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Infiniti</ENAMEX> development team .
But on reflection , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oka</ENAMEX> says , he concluded that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> is being prudent in following its slow - startup strategy instead of simply copying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Infiniti</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's big business move for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</ENAMEX> , and we 're in no hurry to generate large profits right away , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oka</ENAMEX> says .
Despite plans to add <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Infiniti</ENAMEX> models <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> , bringing the total to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Infiniti</ENAMEX> wo n't show profits for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at least five years</ENAMEX> , he adds .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> can afford that strategy , even though profits are n't exactly robust .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> had record net income of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">114.63 billion yen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 868 million</ENAMEX> -RRB- in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fiscal year ended last March 31</ENAMEX> , a remarkable recovery from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">the 20.39 billion yen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years earlier</ENAMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">company</ENAMEX> lost money on operations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> has increased earnings more than market share by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> car sales .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> expects to earn <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only 120 billion yen</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the current fiscal year</ENAMEX> , a modest increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7 %</ENAMEX> .
The big reason : For all its cost - cutting , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> remains less efficient than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">its last fiscal year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's profit represented just <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.3 %</ENAMEX> of sales , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3 %</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota</ENAMEX> .
To help close the gap , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> recently established a top - level cost - cutting committee .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> is the world 's only auto maker currently building vehicles in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</ENAMEX> of the world 's key economic arenas -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> .
That gives it an enviable strategic advantage , at least until its rivals catch up , but also plenty of managerial headaches .
For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> operations include <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> separate subsidiaries -- for manufacturing , sales , design , research , etc. -- that report separately back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
And in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> manufacturing plant beat back a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Auto Workers</ENAMEX> organizing effort with aggressive tactics that have left some workers bitter .
`` We are in a transitional phase from being a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> company to becoming an international company based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muramatsu</ENAMEX> , the executive vice president .
He promises that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> will soon establish a holding company overseeing all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> operations , just as it 's doing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> .
Perhaps the biggest challenge , however , will be to prevent a return to its former corporate rigidity as its recovery continues .
Already , personnel officials are talking about the need for a `` Phase <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> '' cultural - reform effort of some sort .
`` We are still only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> way through the turnaround of this company , and there are many more things to do , '' President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kume</ENAMEX> says .
He adds , however , that `` the momentum we have generated is unstoppable .
