Oil Spill Case Shows Liability Fund Flaws
AN UNRESOLVED <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year - old</ENAMEX> dispute stemming from an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Alaskan</ENAMEX> oil spill has helped spur a drive for tougher federal laws to protect victims of such accidents .
The class - action suit highlights shortcomings of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Liability Fund , which gets its money from oil companies using the pipeline and compensates those harmed by oil spills .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2 , 1987</ENAMEX> , the tanker <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S.S. Glacier Bay</ENAMEX> struck a rock and spilled <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">almost 150,000 gallons</ENAMEX> of oil into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Cook Inlet</ENAMEX> .
Commercial fishermen and fish processors filed suit in federal court in a claim that has ballooned to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 104.8 million</ENAMEX> .
Defendants include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">British Petroleum America</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trinidad Corp.</ENAMEX> , the shipper ; and the pipeline liability fund .
The fund was created by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act</ENAMEX> , which provides that the owner or operator of a vessel involved in an oil spill must pay the first <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14 million</ENAMEX> in damages .
The fund is required to pay claims up to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 86 million</ENAMEX> .
The fund 's purpose is to provide quick and adequate relief .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Glacier Bay</ENAMEX> case , the fund 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> test , shows how easily the fund can be undermined .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trinidad Corp.</ENAMEX> is contesting liability .
It claims <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Coast Guard</ENAMEX> failed to chart the rock and refuses to pay damages .
That means the fund is n't obligated to pay anything , at least so far .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">The Oil Pollution Act</ENAMEX> , scheduled to come up for a vote in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</ENAMEX> , would provide that if claimants are n't paid within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</ENAMEX> of a spill , the liability fund would compensate them and seek reimbursement from the owner or operator of the vessel , says a spokesman for Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Miller</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a sponsor of the bill .
The spokesman says the `` glitch '' in the statute is `` the worst kind of Catch - 22 . ''
Many Law School Grads Find Classes Never End
RECENT LAW school graduates are starting jobs with law firms <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</ENAMEX> -- and heading back to class .
Bar associations and consultants are offering more programs to teach associates all they need to know about law but did n't learn in law school .
`` Law school teaches wonderful theory , but it does n't teach the nuts and bolts of practical lawyering , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aaron Weitz</ENAMEX> , head of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New York County Lawyers ' Association</ENAMEX> committee that sponsors such a course .
In the past , associates learned the basics from senior lawyers who acted as mentors .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> , large firms hire <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 30</ENAMEX> new associates a year , and it 's impossible to personally train everyone , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Henning</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hildebrandt Inc.</ENAMEX> , a consulting firm that runs training classes .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hildebrandt</ENAMEX> course enables students to brush up on negotiation skills by role playing in simulated deals .
Students also are taught to return clients ' phone calls immediately and to treat the support staff with respect .
Many law firms sponsor their own programs .
At the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Weinberg -AMP- Green</ENAMEX> , new corporate and banking associates are required to enroll in a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> - class course .
Partners lecture on how to form corporations , draft agreements and defend clients against unwanted tender offers .
Now , clients know that new associates have had some practical training before working on their cases , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James J. Hanks</ENAMEX> , a partner at the firm .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> Creates A Courthouse for Kids
THE CHILDREN of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> will soon have their own <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 52 million</ENAMEX> courthouse .
The building , which will handle child abuse , custody and foster care cases , will be `` less formal , less threatening and just basically less grim than most courthouses , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Edelman</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors</ENAMEX> .
Designs call for an L - shaped structure with a playground in the center .
There will be recreation and movie rooms .
Teens will be able to listen to music with headsets .
Study halls , complete with reference materials , will be available .
And there will be a nurse 's station and rooms for children to meet with social workers .
The building 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</ENAMEX> courtrooms will be smaller , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlene Saunders</ENAMEX> , a court administrator .
The bench will be lower so the judge seems less intimidating , and walls will be painted in bright colors and covered with murals .
Cases in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles County</ENAMEX> involving dependent children are usually heard in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Criminal Courts Building</ENAMEX> .
`` We need to get the kids away from the criminals into a less traumatic environment , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 45,000</ENAMEX> children in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles County</ENAMEX> are under court supervision , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> says , and an average of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</ENAMEX> new children are added each month .
The courthouse , to be built in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterey Park</ENAMEX> , is expected to open in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring of 1992</ENAMEX> .
Law Firm Management Can Be Quite Rewarding
IT PAYS to follow a management career path -- even at law firms .
That 's the conclusion of a recent study of large law firms conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Altman -AMP- Weil Inc. ,</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ardmore</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , law firm consultant .
Its survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</ENAMEX> firms , each with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 to 1,000</ENAMEX> lawyers , shows that managing partners earned an average of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">395,974</ENAMEX> in compensation and cash benefits in the firms ' <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988 fiscal years</ENAMEX> .
Managing partners who responded to the survey typically spend <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</ENAMEX> their time supervising their firms ' day - to - <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> operations and just a little more than a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">third</ENAMEX> of their time practicing law .
Partners in the survey who devote most of their time to practicing law earned an average of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 217,000</ENAMEX> .
