-- has in the world , one in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> is all too obvious , and as of is in broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> administration is not making much progress getting <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> to lay off each other and talk about it .
The other is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</ENAMEX> working the problem , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> administration and the highest ranking official from there that 's ever been here have had discussions , described to us as direct , and positive and warm .
We 'll get to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a minute</ENAMEX> .
There is no substantial change for the better in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> still having the series of running battles to confirm each other 's worst , even stereotype view of the other .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillian Finley</ENAMEX> begins in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaza</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> soldiers opened fire on school boys , throwing stones .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">12 - year - old</ENAMEX> is in critical condition .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ramallah</ENAMEX> , troops battled older students in what has become a daily event here , but for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's military said the level of violence was significantly lower , and Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> held open the possibility that the harsh action he has been threatening may not be needed .
If there is a beginning of change , he said , we will take that into consideration .
I think it helps .
I think we need relative calm to work out these things .
Relative calm may have come to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> territories , but in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> itself , tension is growing , particularly at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> .
In many cities , angry crowds roam the streets , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jews</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> looking for confrontation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Last night</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel Aviv</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jews</ENAMEX> attacked a restaurant that employs <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> .
`` we want war , '' the crowd chanted .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , one newspaper headline warned of civil war .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> have so often felt insulated from this kind of violence .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">The last 13 days</ENAMEX> have changed all of that .
