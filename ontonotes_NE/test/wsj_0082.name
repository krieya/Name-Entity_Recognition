Criticism in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> over recent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> acquisitions is looming ever larger in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries ' relations .
Officials from both nations say the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> public 's skittishness about <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investment could color a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
Not that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> disagree on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> acquisitions ; indeed , each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
Where they disagree is on the subject of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> direct investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> denies there are real barriers .
The heated talk stirred up by recent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investments in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate , even though it 's only one of many subjects to be covered in the bilateral talks , known as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Structural Impediments Initiative</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> `` should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Dallara</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> secretary , who has been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> informally discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders .
`` We have a long history of maintaining an open direct - investment policy , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dallara</ENAMEX> says .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> fret openly about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> public 's rancor .
One clear sign of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's nervousness came this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> , when a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> devoted nearly all of a regular , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">half - hour</ENAMEX> briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investments in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
`` We believe that it is vitally important for those <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> business interests -LCB- in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> . -RCB- to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> people , '' said the spokesman , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taizo Watanabe</ENAMEX> .
At the same time , though , he chastised the media for paying such close attention to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investment when other foreign countries , notably <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> , are acquiring more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> assets .
Fears that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investors are buying up <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> have escalated sharply in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several weeks</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony Corp. 's</ENAMEX> purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coca - Cola Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Estate Co. 's</ENAMEX> acquisition of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</ENAMEX> holding in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller Group</ENAMEX> , the owner of some of midtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> 's most exclusive real estate .
Even before those moves added fuel , the fires of discontent had been well stoked by the highly publicized experience in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> of one <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> investor , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Boone Pickens Jr</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> oilman has acquired a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26.2 %</ENAMEX> stake valued at more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2 billion</ENAMEX> in an automotive - lighting company , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Koito Manufacturing Co</ENAMEX> .
But he has failed to gain any influence at the company .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Koito</ENAMEX> has refused to grant Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX> seats on its board , asserting he is a greenmailer trying to pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Koito</ENAMEX> 's other shareholders into buying him out at a profit .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX> made considerable political hay with his troubles in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> , chaired by a fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> Trade Representative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carla Hills</ENAMEX> to use Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX> 's experience in talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> `` to highlight this problem facing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> who seek access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> capital markets . ''
While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dallara</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> officials say the question of investors ' access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> markets may get a disproportionate share of the public 's attention , a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> 's talks .
Among them are differences in savings and investment rates , corporate structures and management , and government spending .
Each side has a litany of recommendations for the other .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> says it is anxious for results .
`` We feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we 've identified , and we need it by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next spring</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dallara</ENAMEX> says .
Both sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed .
But they have n't clarified what those might be .
After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> set of meetings <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two months ago</ENAMEX> , some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials complained that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> had n't come up with specific changes it was prepared to make .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> retort that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> round was too early to make concessions .
`` Just to say the distribution system is wrong does n't mean anything , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ministry of International Trade and Industry</ENAMEX> official .
`` We need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it . ''
That process of sorting out specifics is likely to take time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> say , no matter how badly the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> wants quick results .
For instance , at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> meeting the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides could n't even agree on basic data used in price discussions .
Since then , a team of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 15</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MITI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Commerce Department</ENAMEX> officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> , they hope to have a sheaf of documents both sides can trust .
`` Little by little , there is progress , '' says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MITI</ENAMEX> official .
`` Both sides are taking action . ''
