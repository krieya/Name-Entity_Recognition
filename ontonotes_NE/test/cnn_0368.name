A defense attorney calls it his worst nightmare .
A convicted murderer is released from prison before serving his full sentence and then a nightmare becomes reality .
It happened <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Sears</ENAMEX> was determined to prove he was no longer a threat .
His psychiatrist backed him up .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sears</ENAMEX> was serving a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> sentence for the self - confessed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> killing of his wife in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clinton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> , but after a relentless campaign that included a letter from his psychiatrist saying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sears</ENAMEX> was unlikely to commit such violence again , the judge in this case , got him released .
He served <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">less than nine years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> is the only state that allows unchecked judicial reconsideration , allowing judges to reduce prison terms at any time after sentencing .
Those favoring the rule say it gives convicts incentive to behave in prison and enables judges to release prisoners if new evidence comes to light .
At some point after his release , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Sears</ENAMEX> befriended a woman named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darlene Williamson</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williamson</ENAMEX> , a mother of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> , was found stabbed to death at a condominium in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenbelt</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> .
The official resident of that condo , the man now charged with her murder , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Sears</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> the judge in the case retired <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prince Georges County</ENAMEX> Circuit Court Judge issued a statement to the news media .
He called the case and I 'm quoting now , a judge 's worst nightmare , but he noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> parole boards and the facility where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Sears</ENAMEX> was held , the institution made what the judge called the final decision on whether to release <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sears</ENAMEX> .
The psychiatrist , by the way , who wrote a letter on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Sears '</ENAMEX> behalf , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Blumberg</ENAMEX> had a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - word response in an article in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Washington Post</ENAMEX> , My goodness .
He was pretty surprised .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sears</ENAMEX> ' defense attorney who persuaded the judge to reduce the sentence , told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Post</ENAMEX> and I 'm quoting , I 'm very saddened .
It makes me sick as a defense attorney .
As a defense attorney it 's your worst nightmare .
Let 's get perspective on this shocking case .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glen I'vey</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Prince Georges County</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> , state attorney .
It does n't get more shocking than this .
How could this happen ?
