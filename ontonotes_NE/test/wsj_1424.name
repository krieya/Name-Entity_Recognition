In terms of sheer brutality , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Somali</ENAMEX> regime of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Siad Barre</ENAMEX> may rank as No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> in the world .
The only reason that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX> remains in obscurity is numbers : a sparsely populated wasteland of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5 million</ENAMEX> people spread out over an expanse nearly the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> dictatorship simply is limited in the amount of people it can torture and kill .
Beheading small children , stabbing elderly people to death , raping and shooting women , and burying people alive are just a few of the grisly activities that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Somali</ENAMEX> armed forces have been engaged in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">over the past two years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Up to 500,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Somalis</ENAMEX> have escaped to the relative safety of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Marxist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> because of the behavior of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> 's troops .
In the port of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berbera</ENAMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of men of the rival <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Issak</ENAMEX> clan were rounded up in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1988</ENAMEX> , imprisoned , and then taken out at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> in groups of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five to 50</ENAMEX> men to be executed without any judicial process whatsoever .
Guns were never used : Each man was stabbed to death with a large knife .
The horrific details are only now emerging from a painstakingly documented report , based on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of interviews with randomly selected refugees .
The study was done by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Gersony</ENAMEX> , a consultant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. State Department</ENAMEX> who has years of experience in investigating human - rights abuses on both sides of the left - right ideological divide .
What gives these events particular significance , however , is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> on the horn of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> .
Not since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</ENAMEX> has the horn been so up for grabs as it has suddenly become in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">just the past few weeks</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> 's rule is crumbling fast .
Mutinies wrack his armed forces -LRB- really just an armed gang -RRB- , which control less than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> the country .
Inflation is at record levels .
Desperate , he has called in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Libyans</ENAMEX> to help fight the rebels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Somali National Movement</ENAMEX> in the north , which is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</ENAMEX> of several groups picking away at the regime in the capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mogadishu</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy years old</ENAMEX> and a self - declared `` scientific socialist , '' President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> has a power base , composed only of his minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mareham</ENAMEX> clan , that according to observers is `` narrowing . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX> consists of a single runway at the port of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berbera</ENAMEX> , which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Gulf of Aden</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Indian Ocean</ENAMEX> .
That strip of concrete is backed up by a few <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - story , air - conditioned shacks where a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> nationals -- buttressed by imported food , cold soft drinks and back issues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sports Illustrated</ENAMEX> -- maintain radio contact with the outside world .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</ENAMEX> , the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy , where , due to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> 's brutality and ineptitude , nobody is any longer in control .
As long as the rival <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> - backed regime of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu Haile Mariam</ENAMEX> held a total gridlock over neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> was forced to accept that lonely <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berbera</ENAMEX> runway as a distant No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> ' array of airfields next door .
But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few days</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</ENAMEX> , those <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> bases may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> runway .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 7</ENAMEX> , I wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Ethiopian</ENAMEX> soldiers by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Eritrean</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Tigrean</ENAMEX> guerrillas .
Recently , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wollo</ENAMEX> province in the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Tigrean</ENAMEX> forces have killed , wounded and captured an additional <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</ENAMEX> government troops .
-LRB- Think what these numbers mean -- considering the headline space devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of deaths in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> , a small country of little strategic importance ! -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Tigrean</ENAMEX> armies are now <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 miles</ENAMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Addis Ababa</ENAMEX> , threatening the town of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dese</ENAMEX> , which would cut off Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> 's capital from the port of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Assab</ENAMEX> , through which all fuel and other supplies reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Addis Ababa</ENAMEX> .
As a result , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> has been forced to transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of troops from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eritrea</ENAMEX> just to hold the town , thereby risking the loss of even more territory in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eritrea</ENAMEX> only to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Tigreans</ENAMEX> at bay .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> is in an increasingly weak position : <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</ENAMEX> his army is tied down defending the northern city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Asmara</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Eritreans</ENAMEX> .
The weaker he gets , the more he turns toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> for help .
While the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Tigreans</ENAMEX> are communists , like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Eritreans</ENAMEX> they are among the most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="5">anti-Soviet</ENAMEX> guerrillas in the world , having suffered <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a decade</ENAMEX> of aerial bombardment by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> - supplied <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> air force .
What this all means in shorthand is that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> dominance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> is collapsing as fast as President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> 's regime in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX> is .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , therefore , has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX> and to undo the superpower flip - flop of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Horn of Africa</ENAMEX> .
Back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX> :
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The State Department</ENAMEX> , to its credit , has already begun distancing itself from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> , evinced by its decision to publish the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gersony</ENAMEX> report -LRB- which the press has ignored -RRB- .
What 's more , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> has suspended <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.5 million</ENAMEX> in military aid and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</ENAMEX> in economic aid .
But this is not enough .
Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> is still perceived to be tied to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> , when he goes the runway could go too .
Considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway , the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration to blast the regime publicly , in terms clear enough for all influential <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Somalis</ENAMEX> to understand .
It is a certainty that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">days</ENAMEX> are numbered .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> should take care , however , that its own position in the country does not go down with him .
Nobody is sure what will come next in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX> or whom the successor might be .
But as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> expert tells me : `` Whoever it is will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> . ''
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Department</ENAMEX> positions itself for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON" S_OFF="5">post-Barre</ENAMEX> period in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX> , it should continue to back former President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> 's well - intentioned role as a mediator between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Eritrean</ENAMEX> guerrillas in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> , while concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Tigrean</ENAMEX> rebels through neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Ethiopian</ENAMEX> politics are the most sophisticated , secretive and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Byzantine</ENAMEX> in all of black <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> .
Remember that it took Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">many months</ENAMEX> , in what became known as the `` creeping coup , '' to topple Emperor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haile Selassie</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</ENAMEX> .
There is simply no way to engineer a succession covertly , as is sometimes possible elsewhere on the continent .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> has one great advantage : The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> are universally loathed throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> for what they did to the country <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this past decade</ENAMEX> -- famine and all .
It 's not just in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> where the march of events is finally on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> side , but on the horn of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> as well .
The only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> liability in the region is what remains of the link to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> , and that should be cut fast .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan</ENAMEX> , author of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Surrender or Starve : The Wars Behind the Famine</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westview Press</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> -RRB- , lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> .
