In another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off , the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Association of Purchasing Management</ENAMEX> said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixth consecutive month</ENAMEX> .
Its index inched up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47.6 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
Any reading below <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining .
The purchasing managers , however , also said that orders turned up in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</ENAMEX> of decline .
Factories booked <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 236.74 billion</ENAMEX> in orders in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , nearly the same as the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 236.79 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commerce Department</ENAMEX> said .
If not for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59.6 %</ENAMEX> surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors , factory orders would have fallen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.1 %</ENAMEX> .
In a separate report , the department said construction spending ran at an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 415.6 billion</ENAMEX> , not significantly different from the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 415.8 billion</ENAMEX> reported for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> .
Private construction spending was down , but government building activity was up .
The figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</ENAMEX> patterns , but were n't adjusted for inflation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Mayland</ENAMEX> , economist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Society Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> bank , said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off .
At the same time , the drop in interest rates since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</ENAMEX> has failed to revive the residential construction industry .
`` What sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack ? '' he asked .
`` I draw a blank . ''
By most measures , the nation 's industrial sector is now growing very slowly -- if at all .
Factory payrolls fell in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
So did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve Board 's</ENAMEX> industrial - production index .
Yet many economists are n't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession .
They cite a lack of `` imbalances '' that provide early warning signals of a downturn .
Inventories are closely watched for such clues , for instance .
Economists say a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's factory orders report had good news on that front : it said factory inventories fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , the first decline since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1987</ENAMEX> .
`` This conforms to the ` soft landing ' scenario , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott Platt</ENAMEX> , an economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Donaldson , Lufkin -AMP- Jenrette Securities Corp</ENAMEX> .
`` I do n't see any signs that inventories are excessive . ''
A soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession .
The department said orders for nondurable goods -- those intended to last <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fewer than three years</ENAMEX> -- fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 109.73 billion</ENAMEX> after climbing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the month before</ENAMEX> .
Orders for durable goods were up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 127.03 billion</ENAMEX> after rising <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the month before</ENAMEX> .
The department previously estimated that durable - goods orders fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
Factory shipments fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.6 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 234.4 billion</ENAMEX> after rising <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.4 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> .
Shipments have been relatively level since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commerce Department</ENAMEX> noted .
Manufacturers ' backlogs of unfilled orders rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 497.34 billion</ENAMEX> , helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector .
Excluding these orders , backlogs declined <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3 %</ENAMEX> .
In its construction spending report , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commerce Department</ENAMEX> said residential construction , which accounts for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</ENAMEX> of all construction spending , was off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> to an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 191.9 billion</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Berson</ENAMEX> , economist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Mortgage Bankers Association</ENAMEX> , predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single - family homes , but probably not until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early next year</ENAMEX> .
Spending on private , nonresidential construction was off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.6 %</ENAMEX> to an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 99.1 billion</ENAMEX> with no sector showing strength .
Government construction spending rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 88 billion</ENAMEX> .
After adjusting for inflation , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commerce Department</ENAMEX> said construction spending did n't change in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first nine months of the year</ENAMEX> , total construction spending ran <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2 %</ENAMEX> above <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year 's</ENAMEX> level .
The government 's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McGraw - Hill Inc. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">F.W. Dodge Group</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dodge</ENAMEX> reported an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> increase in construction contracts awarded in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
The goverment counts money as it is spent ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dodge</ENAMEX> counts contracts when they are awarded .
The government includes money spent on residential renovation ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dodge</ENAMEX> does n't .
Although the purchasing managers ' index continues to indicate a slowing economy , it is n't signaling an imminent recession , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bretz</ENAMEX> , chairman of the association 's survey committee and director of materials management at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pitney Bowes Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stamford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Conn</ENAMEX> .
He said the index would have to be in the low <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> range for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</ENAMEX> to be considered a forecast of recession .
The report offered new evidence that the nation 's export growth , though still continuing , may be slowing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 19 %</ENAMEX> of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> said export orders were down <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the month before</ENAMEX> .
The purhasing managers ' report also added evidence that inflation is under control .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth consecutive month</ENAMEX> , purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell .
The decline was even steeper than in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
They also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> than they had for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each of the five previous months</ENAMEX> .
Economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating .
When demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen , prices tend to rise .
The purchasing managers ' report is based on data provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 250</ENAMEX> purchasing executives .
Each of the survey 's indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening .
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> survey polled members on imports .
It found that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">the 73 %</ENAMEX> who import , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> said they imported more in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</ENAMEX> said they imported less than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous month</ENAMEX> .
While acknowledging <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one month 's</ENAMEX> figures do n't prove a trend , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bretz</ENAMEX> said , `` It does lead you to suspect imports are going down , or at least not increasing that much . ''
Items listed as being in short supply numbered <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about a dozen</ENAMEX> , but they included <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> newcomer : milk and milk powder .
`` It 's an odd thing to put on the list , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bretz</ENAMEX> noted .
He said that for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the second month in a row</ENAMEX> , food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk .
They blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> exports of dry milk , coupled with very low import quotas .
