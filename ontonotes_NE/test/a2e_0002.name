<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Musta'in Billah</ENAMEX>
In the past , an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> poet praised this tribe which humbled the thrones of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Persians</ENAMEX> and defeated their soldiers and their elephants .
Its leader , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al - Ahnaf ibn Qays</ENAMEX> -LRB- may Allah be pleased with him -RRB- , chased their king until he was killed , exiled and homeless .
If the sons of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Tamim</ENAMEX> were angry with you ........... you would think that all the people were angry .
This is only because the sons of this tribe kept their pledge , were loyal , and were steadfast in confrontation and tough on the enemy .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The Messenger of God</ENAMEX> -LRB- may God bless him and grant him salvation -RRB- , said about them that they are his people .
The alms of our people come from them -LRB- meaning the alms of the sons of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Tamim</ENAMEX> -RRB- narrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslim</ENAMEX> .
The truthful one and the one proved to be true -LRB- God bless him and grant him salvation -RRB- , said about them : " They are the toughest among my nation in battle .
-LRB- They are the toughest of my nation against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antichrist</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
The people of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Tamim</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and a large part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">al - Ahwaz</ENAMEX> have returned from the journey of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Rafidite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Safavid</ENAMEX> pride .
This is because those for whom a happy ending has already been decreed by God in the written book and to whom the good tidings of this came in the language of the faithful one of the heavens and the earth -LRB- God 's blessings on him -RRB- was not to be left by God in the mire of deviation and the valleys of disobedience .
From the heart I am telling you , sons of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Tamim</ENAMEX> , children of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">al - Hamayil</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">al - Butama</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">al - Shirman</ENAMEX> , children of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">al - Kanan</ENAMEX> , people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Basra</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">al - Ahnaf</ENAMEX> , the great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Abu al - Khasib</ENAMEX> , you swords of glory and soldiers of faith and people of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muhammad</ENAMEX> -LRB- may he have God 's blessing and peace -RRB- :
Rejoice and be hopeful .
God will really not forsake those who support His religion .
Your sale will be profitable , as will be that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muhammad</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Bakr</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Umar</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uthman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al - Qaqa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zahra ibn al - Huwayah</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibn al - Mubarak</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al - Darimi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al - Nisa'i</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Yala</ENAMEX> , and those in the forefront .
Sons of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Tamim</ENAMEX> , the cry of glory will always resound , striking terror in the adherents of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mazdaism</ENAMEX> , the sons of whores and group pleasures .
God is Great !
God is Great !
And I am the brother of Daaaaarim .
After me there will be people with the nickname <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al - Rafida</ENAMEX> who reject <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Islam</ENAMEX> and reject it .
Their mark is that there is no <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> prayer and no congregational prayer .
Let whoever encounters them fight them because they are polytheists .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Tarid</ENAMEX>
They deserve this ...
For your information there is a large portion of them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> ... and an area named after them ... which is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawtat Bani Tamim</ENAMEX> ..
Among them are venerable sheikhs such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muhammad bin Abd al - Wahhab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibn Uthaymin</ENAMEX>
