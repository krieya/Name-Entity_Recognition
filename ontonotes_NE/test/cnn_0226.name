No one seems to be sure what 's happened to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sons , but <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing is becoming more clear -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uday</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qusay</ENAMEX> were just as bad as their father if not worse .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">`` Time '' Magazine 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Weisskopf</ENAMEX> has uncovered some stunning details about the lives of these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> .
He joins us now from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
Thanks for taking the time to join us .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> , as I read the article , we knew that these were not good guys , putting it mildly , but as you saw and heard the revelations , what were your reactions ?
They 're stomach turning , to put it bluntly .
The extent of the depravity was truly stunning , you 're right and they took different paths , these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> guys .
The younger of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> brothers , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qusay</ENAMEX> was a very professional killer who pulled the trigger with political aim in mind .
We have eyewitnesses to his orders of execution of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of people in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiite Muslim</ENAMEX> uprising .
His brother , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uday</ENAMEX> , was very highly personal , arbitrary , spontaneous in his attacks , extended to young girls , to friends , to employees .
It was just extraordinary .
With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uday</ENAMEX> , I mean , the stories , you open the article , what you cowrote this article <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sum of Two Evils</ENAMEX> , The Reign of Terror with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> 's sons abducting a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">14 - year - old</ENAMEX> , raping her , crashing wedding parties to rape the brides .
Was that about as bad as it got with these guys ?
I guess it ca n't get much worse .
I thought that the depth may be how he treated his friends , and there are a couple of stories we heard about how he forced friends to drink large quantities of grain alcohol until they vomited .
Also <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> friend he was afraid was going to leave the country and spill the beans on him , he had him arrested by his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fedayeen Saddam</ENAMEX> .
He had him held down , tongue pulled out by pliers and sliced off with a scapel .
Awful .
People still fear them and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> himself .
How did you get people to talk ?
Were they forthcoming or pretty reticent about talking about these guys ?
It was a hard report .
It was hard to find people , and then hard to get them to talk .
Over time , we gained trust .
We promised to hold on to people 's anonimity if we could .
After a little while , after we primed the pump , the people wanted to .
