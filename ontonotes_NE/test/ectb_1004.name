<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> Gets a Message :
Show Us the Money !
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Lin</ENAMEX> / tr. by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Newell</ENAMEX> -RRB-
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> there was an unexpected shock in the presidential election race .
The shock did not come from the announcement on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">10th</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Democratic Progressive Party</ENAMEX> candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Shui - bian</ENAMEX> that his running mate would be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annette Lu</ENAMEX> -LRB- this was expected -RRB- , but rather from revelations about mystery funds which embroiled independent candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> , who had been far ahead in public opinion polls , has suffered a severe blow from the so - called " <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Chung Hsing Case</ENAMEX> , " and his support has dropped markedly , so that now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuomintang</ENAMEX> candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien Chan</ENAMEX> are running neck - and - neck with him .
Indeed , the aftershocks of the case have not subsided .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 22</ENAMEX> , Minister of Finance <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Chiu</ENAMEX> , responding to interpellations in the Legislative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuan</ENAMEX> , officially announced some findings of the investigation into major securities trading by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong Chen - yuan</ENAMEX> , the son of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> .
Most important were revelations about accounts held in the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> family members .
Legislator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Chi - hsiung</ENAMEX> had uncovered <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> funds , valued at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 140 million</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 470 million</ENAMEX> , under the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong Chen - yuan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong 's</ENAMEX> sister - in - law <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Pi - yun</ENAMEX> .
In addition , said Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiu</ENAMEX> , there were other accounts , the largest of which reached as high as <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 300 million</ENAMEX> in value .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Taipei District Prosecutor 's Office</ENAMEX> then opened its own investigation .
It collected evidence from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Finance</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bank of Taiwan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chung Hsing Bills Finance</ENAMEX> , and other institutions .
After tracing the flow of money , it then called in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Pi - yun</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong Chen - yuan</ENAMEX> for questioning .
Faced with outside scepticism , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> then asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New Party</ENAMEX> legislator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsieh Chi - ta</ENAMEX> to form an audit team and investigate .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 28</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsieh</ENAMEX> held a press conference to relate the results of the audit , in which he explained when the accounts were opened , how they were used , and what the flow of the money was .
At the press conference , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Pi - yun</ENAMEX> stated that there was nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> from several sources , including more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 400 million</ENAMEX> left over from funds collected for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> 's campaign for provincial governor -LRB- which , according to the law , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> could retain -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 300 million</ENAMEX> provided by the provincial water conservancy authorities for a fund to train water conservancy specialists , more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 140 million</ENAMEX> in funds provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> for " party operations , " more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 100 million</ENAMEX> for the purpose of looking after the descendants of the late president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Ching - kuo</ENAMEX> , and more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 14 million</ENAMEX> in family savings .
The funds were used , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsieh</ENAMEX> 's audit , to support election campaigns of provincial assemblymen , to support the election campaign of current president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng - hui</ENAMEX> , to pay business expenses for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> , to establish a scholarship fund for students to go <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of California at Berkeley</ENAMEX> , and to support <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong Chen - yuan</ENAMEX> in his studies and business activities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> .
A final version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsieh</ENAMEX> 's findings is to be provided to the investigating authorities .
However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Pi - yun</ENAMEX> provided no reasonable explanation of the key question : Why were public funds mixed up with and deposited along with private funds in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> family 's private accounts ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> , who participated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsieh</ENAMEX> 's press conference , then declared that the mixing of public and private funds was done on the orders of party chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng - hui</ENAMEX> for purposes of " security , reliability , secrecy , and avoiding trouble . "
After the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsieh - Chen - Soong</ENAMEX> press conference , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> held its own .
Party spokesperson <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang Hui - chen</ENAMEX> said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> had never officially authorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> to have or use these funds , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> was suspected of embezzlement .
A judicial investigation will be required to look into this .
So how did all this start ?
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 9</ENAMEX> legislator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Chi - hsiung</ENAMEX> held a press conference at which he stated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong Chen - yuan</ENAMEX> had opened a securities trading account at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chung Hsing Bills Finance</ENAMEX> , that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December of 1992</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong Chen - yuan</ENAMEX> purchased <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 106 million</ENAMEX> in securities , and that as of the date of the press conference , there was more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 140 million</ENAMEX> in securities in the account .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang</ENAMEX> wondered how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong Chen - yuan</ENAMEX> , who had just graduated from university , could possess such a large amount of wealth .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> thereafter stated that after his son had gone abroad to study and start a business , a benevolent " elder " opened an account which would allow the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> to withdraw funds from the interest as needed .
Over the years , there was no special need for the money , and last June <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 140 million</ENAMEX> was returned .
As for who this " elder " is , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> would not say .
But scepticism persisted .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 15</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> held a press conference at which he stated that the account in his son 's name was set up under the direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> party chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng - hui</ENAMEX> .
He said that <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 146,460,000</ENAMEX> was transferred from the special account of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> Secretary - General and deposited in accounts under the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong Chen - yuan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Pi - yun</ENAMEX> .
The money was designated , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> , to take care of the descendants of former president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Ching - kuo</ENAMEX> , and for " party tasks " specially designated by the chairman .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> said that the amounts announced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang</ENAMEX> were inaccurate .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> held a second press conference on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 18</ENAMEX> .
This time he declared only that the money had been intended for looking after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang</ENAMEX> family .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 21</ENAMEX> , Legislator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang</ENAMEX> held his third press conference , in which he stated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> 's sister - in - law , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Pi - yun</ENAMEX> , had , in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">half - month</ENAMEX> period at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 1994</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of 1995</ENAMEX> , used <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 470 million</ENAMEX> in cash to purchase bonds and securities at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chung Hsing</ENAMEX> .
Under pressure from the public and legislators , on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 22</ENAMEX> Minister of Finance <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiu</ENAMEX> announced partial results of their investigation , as mentioned above .
This in turn sparked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> to ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsieh Chi - ta</ENAMEX> for another audit .
There have been no firm conclusions as yet .
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">The Chung Hsing case</ENAMEX> may or may not be fully clarified , but it has certainly greatly affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong 's</ENAMEX> public support .
Before the scandal broke , he was getting more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> support in public opinion polls , but a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 20</ENAMEX> poll by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the China Times</ENAMEX> shows <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> with only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 %</ENAMEX> .
This leaves him behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Shui - bian</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 %</ENAMEX> -RRB- and barely ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien Chan</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Yet , while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> 's support has fallen , that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien</ENAMEX> has not markedly increased .
Obviously former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> supporters are now taking a wait - and - see attitude .
There 's a final point worth reflecting on : This is only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> direct election for the president in the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ROC</ENAMEX> .
Yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention .
There 's little discussion of public policy .
For example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> policy and constitutional reform issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Shui - bian</ENAMEX> .
What is wrong with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's democratic culture ?
Do the public and media need to reassess ?
After all , in the new millennium , there will be many more tests facing us .

<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">The Chung Hsing Securities Case</ENAMEX> has seriously damaged the image of independent presidential candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> .
