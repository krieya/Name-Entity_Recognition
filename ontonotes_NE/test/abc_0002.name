Finally <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">this evening</ENAMEX> -- the auctioneers .
Here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , the gigantic international auction house <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> pleaded guilty to price - fixing with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christie 's</ENAMEX> -- its only real competition in an industry that does <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</ENAMEX> in business <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</ENAMEX> .
This is a case of the rich and the powerful stifling competition .
Here is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aaron Brown</ENAMEX> .
Sold for $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">200,000</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana Brooks</ENAMEX> was at home on center stage in the toney world of high - priced art .
As President of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> , she often conducted the biggest , the highest profile auctions , like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> family treasures , herself .
Sold for $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">95,000</ENAMEX> .
Today , she took center stage in a far grittier place , pleading guilty to bilking <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of wealthy art patrons out of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of millions of dollars</ENAMEX> .
Those charged engaged in classic cartel behavior -- price fixing , pure and simple .
The cartel consisted of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christie 's</ENAMEX> .
Arch rivals for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly three centuries</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> auction houses agreed to fix prices on what they charged the buyers and sellers of high - priced art .
Even arch rivals , it seems , have a common bond .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christie 's</ENAMEX> are all about money .
They are dealing with art , history and beautiful things , but at the end of the day , people go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christie 's</ENAMEX> because they believe they can get best price for them .
They have already agreed to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 500 million</ENAMEX> to settle the civil suits spawned by their crimes .
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooks</ENAMEX> , who could go to prison and will certainly be heavily fined has agreed to turn state 's evidence , turning against her boss .
She becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sammy `` the bull '' Gravano</ENAMEX> with better taste , and the art world , well , while being more careful , perhaps , it continues to do business with the same <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> companies who for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> swindled them .
I think the impact has been negligible .
Much to a lot of people 's surprise , business seems to be booming .
Consignments still seem to be as high as they were before the scandal broke .
Which may be the clearest proof yet that the rich are different from the rest of us .
<ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 million</ENAMEX> .
