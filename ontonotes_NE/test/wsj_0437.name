Copper futures prices failed to extend <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's rally .
Declines came because of concern that demand for copper may slow down .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> contract was down <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">three cents</ENAMEX> a pound , settling at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.1280</ENAMEX> , which was just above the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> 's low of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.1270</ENAMEX> .
Futures prices fell during <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> sessions <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> , and the losses , individually and cumulatively , were greater than the advances .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> of the major factors buoying prices , the prolonged strikes at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> mine in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cananea</ENAMEX> mine in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , were finally resolved .
Also , the premiums paid by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government on a purchase of copper for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Mint</ENAMEX> were lower than expected , and acted as a price depressant , analysts said .
The mint purchases were at premiums <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 4 1/2 cents</ENAMEX> a pound above the respective prices for the copper .
At the time merchants were asking for premiums of about <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">five cents</ENAMEX> a pound .
All this has led to prolonged selling in futures , mostly on the part of computer - guided funds .
Prices fell through levels regarded as important support areas , which added to the selling .
The reluctance of traders to buy contracts indicates that they have begun focusing on demand rather than supply .
At least one analyst noted that as production improves , the concern among traders is whether the prospective increased supply will find buyers because of uncertainty over national economies .
`` Demand from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> is expected to continue strong , but not from other areas of the world into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first quarter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> normally depends heavily on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cananea</ENAMEX> mines as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bougainville</ENAMEX> mine in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papua New Guinea</ENAMEX> .
Recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> has been buying copper elsewhere .
But as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cananea</ENAMEX> begin operating , they are expected to resume their roles as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's suppliers .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Demler</ENAMEX> , metals economist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> has already started operating and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cananea</ENAMEX> is expected to do so soon . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bougainville</ENAMEX> mine is generally expected to remain closed until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at least the end of the year</ENAMEX> .
It has n't been operating since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May 15</ENAMEX> because of attacks by native landowners .
A recent attempt to resume operations was cut short quickly by these attacks .
However , traders disregarded a potential production disruption in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chile</ENAMEX> and a continued drop in inventories .
Workers at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chilean</ENAMEX> mines , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Los Bronces</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Soldado</ENAMEX> , which belong to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Exxon</ENAMEX> - owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minera Disputado</ENAMEX> group , will vote <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> on whether to strike after a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> labor pact ends <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
The mines produced a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">110,000 tons</ENAMEX> of copper in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demler</ENAMEX> , the potential strike is expected to be resolved quickly , which may be one reason why the situation did n't affect prices much .
Another analyst said that , if there was any concern , it was that a strike could encourage other walkouts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chile</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">London Metal Exchange</ENAMEX> copper inventories fell <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">550 tons</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">83,950 tons</ENAMEX> , a smaller - than - expected decline .
But that development also had little effect on traders ' sentiment .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demler</ENAMEX> said that stocks of copper in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> producers ' hands at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of September</ENAMEX> were down <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16,000 metric tons</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30,000 tons</ENAMEX> .
Outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , he said , producer stocks at the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">273,000 tons</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,000 tons</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of July</ENAMEX> .
Consumer stocks of copper in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> fell to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">44,000 tons</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of September</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">54,000 tons</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</ENAMEX> earlier , and stocks of copper held by consumers and merchants outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of July</ENAMEX> stood at <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">123,000 tons</ENAMEX> , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">125,000 tons</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> .
The high point of foreigners ' copper stocks <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">136,000 tons</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of April</ENAMEX> , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demler</ENAMEX> .
In other commodity markets <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> :
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS :
The prices of most corn , soybean and wheat futures contracts dropped slightly as farmers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Midwest</ENAMEX> continued to rebuild stockpiles that were depleted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> drought .
Buying by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> has helped to prop up corn prices in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</ENAMEX> , but a lack of any new purchases kept prices in the doldrums .
COFFEE :
Futures prices rose slightly in a market filled with rumors that a new international coffee agreement might still be achieved .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> contract ended with a gain of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.29 cents</ENAMEX> a pound at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">74.35 cents</ENAMEX> .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> analyst , prices opened higher because of reports over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX> , at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Pan-American</ENAMEX> summit meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> , had agreed to a reduction in their coffee export quotas for the sake of creating a new agreement .
The reports , attributed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Colombian</ENAMEX> minister of economic development , said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> would give up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</ENAMEX> bags of its quota and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</ENAMEX> bags , the analyst said .
These reports were later denied by a high Brazilian official , who said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> was n't involved in any coffee discussions on quotas , the analyst said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Colombian</ENAMEX> minister was said to have referred to a letter that he said President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Colombian</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virgilio Barco</ENAMEX> , and in which President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said it was possible to overcome obstacles to a new agreement .
The minister was also quoted as saying that a new pact could be achieved during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half of next year</ENAMEX> , according to the analyst .
PRECIOUS METALS :
Futures prices showed modest changes in light trading volume .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> delivery gold eased <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 cents</ENAMEX> an ounce to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">380.80</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> silver was off <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.7 cents</ENAMEX> an ounce at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.2830</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> platinum rose <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">90 cents</ENAMEX> an ounce at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">500.20</ENAMEX> .
The market turned quiet after rising sharply <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late last week</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> analyst .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week 's</ENAMEX> uncertainty in the stock market and a weaker <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</ENAMEX> triggered a flight to safety , he said , but <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> the market lacked such stimuli .
There was some profit - taking because prices for all the precious metals had risen to levels at which there was resistance to further advance , he said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</ENAMEX> was also slightly firmer and prompted some selling , as well , according to the analyst .
