In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , soon after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang Laboratories Inc.</ENAMEX> reported a staggering <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 424.3 million</ENAMEX> loss and replaced its president , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> sales representatives sent customers a letter saying : `` We fully expect that you will soon be reading stories in the press reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the ` Amazing Comeback at Wang</ENAMEX> . ' ''
How soon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> will stage a comeback , or if it will at all , are still matters of debate .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> salespeople are trying to cope with the biggest challenge any marketer can face : selling the products of a company that is on the ropes .
`` If your prospect is feeling risk the whole time and you 're not feeling as if you 're backed up by a stable company , you 've lost it before you 've begun , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Ann Cluggish</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellesley</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , sales trainer and consultant who works with high technology companies .
It can happen in any industry .
Consider the difficulties faced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Audi</ENAMEX> salespeople when the car was tainted by false charges of sudden acceleration , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Exxon</ENAMEX> dealers ' problems in the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Valdez</ENAMEX> oil spill .
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of salespeople before them , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's are finding ways to combat the bad news .
`` It 's very important that we exude confidence , even though within the family we know there 's a lot of hard work ahead , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Miller</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lowell</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , computer concern 's new president , in a video message to salespeople <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</ENAMEX> after he took over .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> got into financial trouble because of bloated overhead and overly optimistic sales forecasts .
Its mainline minicomputers and word processors have lost ground to cheaper personal computers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> it funded its high employment by heavy borrowing , and it suffered huge losses when sales turned down instead of rising .
After the company reported red ink for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fiscal third quarter</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's marketing department provided the sales force answers to questions such as `` How could you not have known you were going to lose <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55 million</ENAMEX> ? '' and `` Is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> still a viable company ? ''
Salespeople try to push their products and avoid discussions of finances .
Responding to such questions is `` defensive , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Olissa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's vice president , marketing .
`` That 's antithetical to the art of selling . ''
Moreover , he notes that analyzing financial results `` poses a problem for a salesman who is n't particularly familiar with a balance sheet . ''
At <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> sales strategy meeting , an executive suggested ordering salespeople to become experts on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> report .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> vetoed that : `` Even I ca n't understand all the footnotes , '' he says .
Instead , he says , if the salespeople can get the customers to consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's products on their merits , he or a top financial officer will try to assuage the fears about finances .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Metschan</ENAMEX> , a salesman in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> , office , has a breezier method : `` We tell them <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</ENAMEX> companies do n't go out of business .
We tell them all the major companies are having financial difficulties . ''
Numerous computer companies are having sales slumps and earnings declines , but very few have had losses comparable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's or are carrying such a large debt load .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> says that after a sharp sales slump in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , sales stabilized in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> will report a loss for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first quarter ended Sept. 30</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the full fiscal year</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> says he expects the company will return to profitability by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth quarter</ENAMEX> .
Experts on sales technique say anyone representing a troubled company must walk a fine line .
`` If a salesman jeopardizes his credibility in this time of trouble , it will be a problem for the long run , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Palmatier</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minden</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nev.</ENAMEX> , sales consultant and author of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Marketing Edge</ENAMEX> . ''
Still , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sullivan</ENAMEX> , a management recruiter with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daniel Roberts Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> , who has held senior sales positions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Polaroid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Atari</ENAMEX> : `` The customer will react to strength .
Ignore the present condition .
Show it 's business as usual . ''
That is n't easy .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's customers are data processing managers who want to be sure that their suppliers are stable , wellrun companies that will be around to fix bugs and upgrade computers for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> to come .
For buyers , `` these are career - risking decisions , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Conlin</ENAMEX> , who supervises a network of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> computers in the admissions department at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boston University</ENAMEX> .
The university is considering installing a $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">250,000</ENAMEX> system to store applications electronically .
`` Before the really bad news , we were looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> fairly seriously , '' she says .
But `` their present financial condition means I 'd have a hard time convincing the vice president in charge of purchasing . ''
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conlin</ENAMEX> adds : `` At some point we 'd have to ask , ` How do we know that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> you wo n't be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> ? ' ''
During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> has developed new products and a new strategy and hired a new president .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's overall product line is `` still not as good as other vendors , but they 've come a long way , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Wendler</ENAMEX> , a consultant with market researcher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gartner Group</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stamford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Conn</ENAMEX> .
`` They were on the road to recovery in terms of customer attitudes until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this bad quarter</ENAMEX> happened . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> priority for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's sales force is to make sure it holds on to existing customers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's installed base is one of its greatest assets , and many of those customers remain extremely loyal .
But even before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's latest financial troubles surfaced , some customers `` were trying to wall off their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> installations '' so other departments would n't add <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Christiansen</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> marketer who is now a market analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Meta Group</ENAMEX> , a market research firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stamford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Conn</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> salesman who left the company in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> recalls that when he tried to sell products to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastman Kodak</ENAMEX> , he worked `` to muster support from internal allies , '' but `` those allies became skeptical as they saw the downtrend .
The more recent losses were really devastating . ''
New customers , the source of higher commissions for salespeople and the key to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's long - term viability , are even tougher .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Lynch</ENAMEX> , a former top salesman in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> office , referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's mainstay computer line , says : `` You ca n't sell a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VS</ENAMEX> to a new customer . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynch</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Oracle Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> , a software vendor .
The financial problems are particularly frustrating for salespeople pushing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's image systems , which convert paper forms to electronic documents .
Consultants say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's technology is among the best available in the image market .
But salespeople often found that news of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's problems superseded their sales efforts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Tait</ENAMEX> , a former sales manager in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> , says that his office had all but sold a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 million</ENAMEX> image system to pharmaceutical maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eli Lilly -AMP- Co</ENAMEX> .
`` When they were making the decision , all hell broke loose with the finances . ''
He says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lilly</ENAMEX> executives told him they could n't take the risk with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tait</ENAMEX> say he does n't blame <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lilly</ENAMEX> .
Buyers have to rely on a supplier `` continually upgrading and replacing the product , '' he says .
`` When a company realizes that , it 's hard to go with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> . ''
For Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tait</ENAMEX> , who says he used to earn <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 150,000</ENAMEX> a year at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> , it was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> more reason to quit .
He is now president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastate Homes Inc.</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> contractor .
It can be hard for a salesperson to fight off feelings of discouragement .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Petre</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> salesman in upstate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , says : `` You have pride in your job .
You think you can go out and turn things around .
It 's a tough thing when you ca n't .
The reason does n't relate to your selling skills . ''
Discouragement feeds on itself .
`` The problem is , if people get down in the dumps , they stop selling , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Durcan</ENAMEX> , a laid - off sales manager in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> office .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> key for salespeople is to boost their own morale .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Hellman</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , sales and management consultant and author of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ready , Aim , You 're Hired</ENAMEX> , '' says : `` The bad news is , you 'll be rejected more .
The good news is , it 's not your fault . ''
So , he advises , make goals achievable .
For instance , he suggests that salespeople making telephone calls should say to themselves : `` All I want to do today is get <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> rejections . ''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> 's new president , recently warned his salespeople about negativism .
`` Our customers watch us for the hidden message , '' he said .
`` Look a customer right in the eye and say , ` I 'm glad to be at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wang</ENAMEX> .
