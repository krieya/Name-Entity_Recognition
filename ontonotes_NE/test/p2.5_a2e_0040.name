Over a month ago , the experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> politician <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adnan Pachachi</ENAMEX> doubted Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nouri Al - Malaki</ENAMEX> 's ability to carry out his promise to disband the armed militias and disarm them and said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Maliki</ENAMEX> was in one corner and his government ministers , whether <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiites</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Al - Sadr movement</ENAMEX> and Al - Hakim 's group or <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> , were in another corner in terms of their allegiance to parties that have armed militias .
In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pachachi</ENAMEX> 's conclusions are nothing new for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> situation that has reached the edge of a bottomless pit because of these militias whose existence the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> man on the street can no longer tolerate as they have turned his life into a hell worse than the fire of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fedayeen</ENAMEX> and the bloody Hunin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">apparatus</ENAMEX> during the first chapter of dictatorship in the land of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mesopotamia</ENAMEX> .
And while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Maliki</ENAMEX> reached a new level of confrontation in his attack in parliament a few days ago when he denounced those he called " politicians during the day and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pro-Saddam</ENAMEX> militias and terrorists at night , " <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diri Al - Sadri</ENAMEX> who escaped an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> raid to capture him is still active , and openly so , in his stronghold in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Al - Sadr city</ENAMEX> some of whose residents boasted in a statement reported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Al - Hayat</ENAMEX> of what they called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Diri 's</ENAMEX> relations with officials who visit in order to get close to him .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali Al - Bideri</ENAMEX> said with pride , " Our area has become notorious and is being constantly visited by senior state officials who seek <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Diri 's</ENAMEX> approval and pledge their obedience .
This has made people flock to his house in search of his mediation with them to empoy their unemployed children . "
These visits , according to this proud citizen , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Bideri</ENAMEX> " are not just by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> state officials but also by foreigners from an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> state " which is , of course , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> .
