<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> said it plans to institute an additional `` circuit breaker '' aimed at stemming market slides .
Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Phelan</ENAMEX> told a closed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> subcommittee meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> that he would support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> halts of program trading during market emergencies .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> chairman said he does n't support reinstating a `` collar '' on program trading , arguing that firms could get around such a limit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Chicago Merc</ENAMEX> said a new <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one - hour</ENAMEX> price limit would take effect in its Standard -AMP- Poor 's 500 stock - index futures pit once S-AMP-P 500 futures fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> index points -- the equivalent of about a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</ENAMEX> - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> - point limit is triggered after <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">1:30 p.m . Chicago time</ENAMEX> , it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">3:15 p.m</ENAMEX> .
With the limit in effect , members would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices , but not below it .
The exchange said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock - index futures on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday Oct. 13</ENAMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> industrials plunged <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</ENAMEX> points and stock - index futures prices skidded as well .
Late that <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</ENAMEX> the S-AMP-P 500 stock - index futures contract fell a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> index points , hitting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merc</ENAMEX> circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merc</ENAMEX> said that its existing <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">30 - minute</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 - point</ENAMEX> limit on S-AMP-P 500 stock - index futures trading -LRB- equal to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</ENAMEX> points on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> industrials -RRB- , which was triggered <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 13</ENAMEX> , will remain in effect .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo Melamed</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merc</ENAMEX> executive committee chairman , said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> - point limit appeared to lessen the selling panic <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 13</ENAMEX> .
But when the contract reopened , the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> - point limit indicated that the intermediate limit of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> points was needed to help keep stock and stock - index futures prices synchronized .
Several traders maintained that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merc</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> - point circuit - breaker aggravated the market slide <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 13</ENAMEX> by directing additional selling pressure to the floor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
All of the changes require regulatory approval , which is expected shortly .
The exchange also said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> - point circuit breaker , which currently provides only a <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">one - hour</ENAMEX> respite during market sell - offs , will become the maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one - day</ENAMEX> limit for the S-AMP-P 500 stock - index futures contract ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one - day</ENAMEX> limit now is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> index points .
A final modification was made to the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> - point opening limit for the contract .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merc</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> - point limit will remain in effect for the first <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</ENAMEX> of trading .
The limit lapses under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</ENAMEX> of trading .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> aides said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> told congressmen that the collar , which banned program trades through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board 's</ENAMEX> computer when the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> points , did n't work well .
He said that firms could get around the collar by executing trades manually .
In a post-hearing news conference , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> , who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility , said he told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program - trading halt proposal `` providing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> would be comfortable with the language '' in a bill .
The program - trading issue is heating up on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> as it is on Wall Street , and several legislators want to grant the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> has said he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have preset trigger points , but he does n't want discretionary power to stop programs .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> aide suggested that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> was so `` vague and mushy '' that it was the kind of meeting where people of all viewpoints could `` come out feeling good . ''
At <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> point , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> angered the subcommittee 's chairman , Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Markey</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> newspapers .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Markey</ENAMEX> said we could have done this in public '' because so little sensitive information was disclosed , the aide said .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel , the aide added .
At another point during the hearing , Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Markey</ENAMEX> asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> what would be discussed at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New York exchange</ENAMEX> board meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> is likely to study the program - trading issue .
That response annoyed Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Markey</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> aides said , and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</ENAMEX> subcommittee members attended the hearing , most notably Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mich.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House Energy and Commerce Committee</ENAMEX> chairman , who has been willing to let Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Markey</ENAMEX> carry the legislation in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> expressed concern , sources said , about jurisdictional problems in regulating program trading , which uses futures to offset stock trades .
The futures industry is regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX> , which reports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Agriculture</ENAMEX> committees in both houses .
