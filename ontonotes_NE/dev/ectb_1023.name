Constitutional Revision Paves Way for Phasing Out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Assembly</ENAMEX>

On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 24</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> finalized the chief task of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</ENAMEX> round of constitutional revisions during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng - hui 's</ENAMEX> presidency : its own demobilization .
While this development will allay popular fears of an everlasting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Assembly</ENAMEX> , how to formulate comprehensive measures to fill in the constitutional and functional void of the moribund body becomes the next vital task .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March 24</ENAMEX> , just days after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> presidential election , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Council of Grand Justices</ENAMEX> made a constitutional interpretation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Assembly</ENAMEX> term extension , declaring the move null and void .
This stirred the ire of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Assembly</ENAMEX> members , who struck back during the ensuing constitutional revision session , claiming that " lifelong privileges for grand justices violate the constitution . "
The reaction by a minority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NA</ENAMEX> delegates to the grand justices ' constitutional interpretation once again triggered displeasure in society at the body 's refusal to admit its fallibility .
Activists in groups such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Taipei Society</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Association of Taiwanese University Professors</ENAMEX> organized a street demonstration to call for the dissolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> .
A further consequence of the grand justices ' ruling was that an election would have to be held to produce a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Assembly</ENAMEX> membership before the conclusion of the current term .
While this development had would - be candidates in all parties scrambling to launch election campaigns , by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late March</ENAMEX> the post-presidential-election situation , combined with pressure from public opinion , pushed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> to work with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> on means to phase out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> , despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> 's previous opposition to the body 's complete dissolution in the name of preserving the constitutional structure .
For a time , the question of whether to hold elections for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> , as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> 's shared policy for phasing out the body , were viewed as motivated by fear of the growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the People First Party</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PFP</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Thus the hubbub continued over the fate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> for a fortnight , until finally the newly formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PFP</ENAMEX> caucus in the assembly agreed to its gradual downsizing .
This paved the way for the commencement on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 8</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</ENAMEX> round of constitutional revisions in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , in which such issues as reducing the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NA</ENAMEX> delegates and freezing their powers and duties - amounting to their " self - abolition " - became the center of discussion .
The various parties leveraged their carrots and sticks against their delegates , threatening expulsion for not supporting the neutralization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> at the same time as they tried to appease their delegates .
Finally , on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 24</ENAMEX> these maneuvers helped bring about the passage of several constitutional revisions , including deactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> , favorable provisions for residents of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's offshore islands -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Kinmen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Matsu</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Penghu</ENAMEX> -RRB- and military personnel , and revocation of lifelong special privileges for grand justices .
In line with these revisions , the voting public will no longer directly elect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NA</ENAMEX> delegates .
Rather , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> will become a " task - based body " generated according to proportional political party representation in the legislature , maintaining the rights to ratification of constitutional revisions proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Legislative Yuan</ENAMEX> , impeachment of the president and vice president , and resolutions on modifications to national territory .
With these changes , legislators will exercise approval over personnel appointments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Judicial</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Examination</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Control yuans</ENAMEX> .
To be fair , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition .
This is especially notable given the ambiguity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - headed system in the true sense .
Many scholars caution that eliminating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> and handing all its powers to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Legislative Yuan</ENAMEX> , while the government structure remains ambiguous , is not the best structural framework .
That said , despite landmark changes such as the full election of the national parliament in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and establishment of the legal groundwork for the direct election of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> president , <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the ROC Constitution</ENAMEX> has been revamped with alarming frequency over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</ENAMEX> .
In fact , some have scoffed that the constitution , the basis upon which the nation 's laws are founded , has been tinkered with more often than the civil and criminal codes .
Further , new duties and authorities were given to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> in order to achieve successive constitutional revisions .
For instance , in exchange for the assembly agreeing to give up its authority to elect the president , the body was given power of approval over personnel appointments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Judicial Yuan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Examination Yuan</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Control Yuan</ENAMEX> .
With each revision , the constitution became increasingly jumbled , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NA</ENAMEX> delegates leveraged their positions to exact " constitutional amendment rent " and fatten themselves up .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year 's</ENAMEX> term extension bill further solidified the public 's image of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> as no more than a tool of political struggle , and a self - indulgent body at that , generating widespread consensus on the necessity of dissolving it .
While the latest round of constitutional revisions satisfies the general desire across the political spectrum to progressively dismantle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> , sloppy accompanying provisions and the failure of the various political parties to propose a new blueprint in its place provide cause for new concern over the health of constitutional government in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> .
For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> will become a " task - based body " generated according to the proportion of seats held by each political party in the legislature .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Taiwan University</ENAMEX> professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Hung - hsi</ENAMEX> , an expert on constitutional law , points out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> population takes part in political party activities .
Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">a National Assembly</ENAMEX> generated proportionally according to party representation represents suppression of the views of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">the other 90 %</ENAMEX> of the population , and thus violates the principle of vesting authority over constitutional government in the people .
Following the demobilization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> , many functions and powers currently held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> will be transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Legislative Yuan</ENAMEX> .
This in turn raises fears in the academic community that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Legislative Yuan</ENAMEX> could become an untamable new constitutional monster .
The expanded powers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Legislative Yuan</ENAMEX> also include the impeachment and recall of the president and vice president , and the supplementary election of the vice president .
These changes tighten the relationship between the parliament and the president , requiring the president to report to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Legislative Yuan</ENAMEX> on the state of the nation .
But the president has only the passive authority to dissolve the parliament .
In the face of a parliament with supreme powers , a president whose party claims only a minority in the legislature is powerless even to replace a premier with whom he does not see eye to eye , leaving him devoid of the authorities and responsibilities to correspond with his administrative actions .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">China Times</ENAMEX> editorial urged that the question of whether the enormous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Legislative Yuan</ENAMEX> might be split into <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> houses by function be evaluated and worked out as soon as possible .
The legal demobilization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak .
This dire outlook is surely not something <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Assembly</ENAMEX> .
