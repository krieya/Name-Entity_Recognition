Banks are continuing to go after individual investors , despite falling interest rates .
Yields on small - denomination certificates of deposit fell at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</ENAMEX> the rate of so - called jumbo CDs <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Banxquote Money Markets</ENAMEX> , an information service based here .
Investors can get slightly higher yields on deposits below $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">50,000</ENAMEX> than they can on deposits of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">90,000</ENAMEX> and up .
`` Banks want to remain competitive , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norberto Mehl</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Banxquote</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a big rollover month</ENAMEX> and perhaps they anticipate greater demand ... among people leaving the stock market . ''
Some bankers are reporting more inquiries than usual about CDs since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
`` Reports from branches are that there has been greater interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last day</ENAMEX> or so , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Braitman</ENAMEX> , a vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical</ENAMEX> said deposits <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 5 million</ENAMEX> higher than usual and it expects more activity as investors receive the proceeds from sales of stock .
`` This is no time to be playing in the street ...
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow</ENAMEX> has more ups and downs than an elevator , '' proclaimed an advertisement <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> newspapers , touting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lincoln Savings Bank 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one - year</ENAMEX> CD .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Jones</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lincoln</ENAMEX> 's chief retail banking officer , said there has n't yet been `` a discernible response , '' although the ad included a coupon that could arrive <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">later in the week</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's market rout came smack in the middle of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the heaviest month</ENAMEX> for CD rollovers , when a number of banks and thrifts already have promotions under way .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First National Bank of Boston</ENAMEX> , for example , is offering certain new depositors <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an extra quarter</ENAMEX> of a percentage point on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">12 - month</ENAMEX> CDs .
Some banks actually boosted yields on the shortest term CDs in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the latest week</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citibank</ENAMEX> , for instance , increased the yield on small - denomination <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - month</ENAMEX> CDs to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.9 %</ENAMEX> .
On average , however , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - month</ENAMEX> CDs at major banks are yielding <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a tenth</ENAMEX> of a percentage point less than they were <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week ago</ENAMEX> .
Average yields on CDs aimed at individual investors fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than half</ENAMEX> as much as yields on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills sold at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> 's auction .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Six - month</ENAMEX> CDs of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">50,000</ENAMEX> and less yielded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an average 8.02 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the week ended Tuesday</ENAMEX> , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.10 %</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Banxquote</ENAMEX> .
The yield on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> T - bills fell to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.82 %</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> , from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.01 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the week before</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , the average yield on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> CDs of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 90,000</ENAMEX> fell to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.93 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the latest week</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Banxquote</ENAMEX> , from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.10 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the week before</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehl</ENAMEX> noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and large - denomination CDs , but yields on CDs aimed at the individual investor are boosted by more frequent compounding .
CDs sold by major brokerage houses , which like jumbo CDs tend to closely follow interest rate trends , also posted larger drops in yields .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> , broker - sold CD , for example , was yielding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an average 8.09 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the latest week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a fifth</ENAMEX> of a percentage point lower than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the week before</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late April</ENAMEX> , when interest rates were at their recent highs , short - term CDs sold by brokers were offering yields <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> a percentage point or more higher than banks .
CD yields are generally expected to fall further in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">coming weeks</ENAMEX> .
`` What happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit '' reported <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> `` make it unlikely that short - term interest rates will rise '' any time soon , said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehl</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Banxquote</ENAMEX> .
`` Even before the market drop , rates were down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</ENAMEX> a percentage point , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert J. Hutchinson</ENAMEX> , senior vice president for retail marketing at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
`` That puts pressure on CD rates .
