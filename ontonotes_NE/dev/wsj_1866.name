<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years</ENAMEX> of coddling , down the drain .
That 's the way a lot of brokers feel <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> anniversary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> stock - market crash .
Ever since that fearful <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Black Monday</ENAMEX> , they 've been tirelessly wooing wary individual investors -- trying to convince them that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 19 , 1987 ,</ENAMEX> was a fluke and that the stock market really is a safe place for average <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> to put their hard - earned dollars .
And until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Friday</ENAMEX> , it seemed those efforts were starting to pay off .
`` Some of those folks were coming back , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie Quick Jr.</ENAMEX> , chairman , of discount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">brokers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Quick -AMP- Reilly Group Inc</ENAMEX> .
`` We had heard from people who had n't been active '' for a long time .
Then came the frightening <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</ENAMEX> - point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a new wave of stock - market volatility .
All of a sudden , it was back to square <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's going to set things back for a period , because it reinforces the concern of volatility , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey B. Lane</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ENAMEX> .
`` I think it will shake confidence <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> more time , and a lot of this business is based on client confidence . ''
Brokers around the country say the reaction from individual investors <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> has been almost eerie .
Customers and potential customers are suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way they did in post-crash <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> .
`` The kinds of questions you had before have resurfaced , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond A. `` Chip '' Mason</ENAMEX> , chairman of regional brokerage firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Legg Mason Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> .
`` I can just tell the questions are right back where they were : ` What 's going on ? , ' ` Ca n't anything be done about program trading ? , ' ` Does n't the exchange understand ? , ' ` Where is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> on this ? ' ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> says he 's convinced the public still wants to invest in common stocks , even though they believe the deck is stacked against them .
But `` these wide swings scare them to death . ''
All of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> that have big `` retail , '' or individual - investor , businesses .
After expanding rapidly during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the bull - market years</ENAMEX> up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash , retail brokerage operations these days are getting barely enough business to pay the overhead .
True , the amount of money investors are willing to entrust to their brokers has been growing lately .
But those dollars have been going into such `` safe '' products as money market funds , which do n't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage firms .
At discount brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Charles Schwab -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , such `` cash - equivalent '' investments recently accounted for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a record $ 8 billion</ENAMEX> of the firm 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 billion</ENAMEX> of client 's assets .
The brokers ' hope has been that they could soon coax investors into shifting some of their hoard into the stock market .
And before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Friday</ENAMEX> , they were actually making modest progress .
A slightly higher percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> volume has been attributed to retail investors in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</ENAMEX> compared with post-crash <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Securities Industry Association</ENAMEX> data .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , an average <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.7 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> volume was retail business , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> level never <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 21.4 %</ENAMEX> .
The retail participation dropped to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an average 18.2 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , and shriveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">barely 14 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">some months</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</ENAMEX> .
Yet in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> , retail participation has been <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</ENAMEX> , and was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.5 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the latest month</ENAMEX> for which figures are available .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Schaefer</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SIA</ENAMEX> 's research director , says that all of his group 's retail - volume statistics could be overstated by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as five</ENAMEX> percentage points because corporate buy - backs are sometimes inadvertently included in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> data .
But there did seem to be a retail activity pickup .
But `` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> did n't help things , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schaefer</ENAMEX> .
With the gyrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent days</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo Quackenbush</ENAMEX> , senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Charles Schwab</ENAMEX> , many small investors are absolutely convinced that `` they should n't play in the stock market . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Grano</ENAMEX> , president of retail sales and marketing at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market .
Investors will develop `` thicker skins , '' and their confidence will return , he says .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's plunge , he is telling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> brokers , was nothing more than a `` tremendous reaction to leveraged buy - out stocks . ''
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving Wall Street their money .
`` It 's more of an important issue to keep control of those assets , rather than push the investor to move into -LRB- specific -RRB- products such as equities , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grano</ENAMEX> says .
`` The equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there 's a semblance of confidence . ''
It could be a long wait , say some industry observers .
`` Some investors will tiptoe back in , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Ross</ENAMEX> , a market research director for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Elrick -AMP- Lavidge</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
`` Then there 'll be another swing .
Given enough of these , this will drive everyone out except the most hardy , '' he adds .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> , who has been studying retail investors ' perception of risks in the brokerage industry , said a market plunge like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's `` shatters investors ' confidence in their ability to make any judgments on the market . ''
The long - term outlook for the retail brokerage business is `` miserable , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> declares .
