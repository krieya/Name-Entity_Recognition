Population Drain Ends For Midwestern States
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IOWA</ENAMEX> IS MAKING a comeback .
So are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> .
The population of all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> states is on the upswing , according to new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> estimates , following declines throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</ENAMEX> .
The gains , to be sure , are rather small .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> , for instance , saw its population grow by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,000</ENAMEX> people , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4 %</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1987 and 1988</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Census Bureau</ENAMEX> says .
Still , even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't grown at all since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1987 and 1988</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Dakota</ENAMEX> was the only state in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Midwest</ENAMEX> to lose population , a loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</ENAMEX> people .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> midwestern states have been growing steadily since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northeast</ENAMEX> has been holding its own in the population race .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</ENAMEX> states have grown <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , which lost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</ENAMEX> of its population during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</ENAMEX> .
And although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> suffered slight declines earlier in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</ENAMEX> , they are growing again .
At the same time , several states in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> have had their own population turnaround .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</ENAMEX> states that grew in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</ENAMEX> are now losing population -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> .
Overall , though , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> still outpace the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northeast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Midwest</ENAMEX> , and fast - growing states like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> ensure that the pattern will continue .
But the growth gap between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Sun Belt</ENAMEX> and other regions has clearly started narrowing .
More Elderly Maintain Their Independence
THANKS TO modern medicine , more couples are growing old together .
And even after losing a spouse , more of the elderly are staying independent .
A new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64 %</ENAMEX> of people <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 65 to 74</ENAMEX> were living with a spouse in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</ENAMEX> .
This does n't mean they 're less likely to live alone , however .
That share has remained at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 24 %</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</ENAMEX> .
What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives , such as children .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> of those <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 65 to 74 lived</ENAMEX> with relatives other than spouses , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</ENAMEX> .
As people get even older , many become widowed .
But even among those <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 75 and older</ENAMEX> , the share living with a spouse rose slightly , to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</ENAMEX> .
Like their younger counterparts , the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 17 %</ENAMEX> of those <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 75 and older</ENAMEX> lived with relatives other than spouses in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</ENAMEX> .
The likelihood of living alone beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 75</ENAMEX> has increased to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32 %</ENAMEX> .
More people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially .
Careers Count Most For the Well - to - Do
MANY AFFLUENT people place personal success and money above family .
At least that 's what a survey by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ernst -AMP- Young</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yankelovich , Clancy , Shulman</ENAMEX> indicates .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two - thirds</ENAMEX> of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs , while <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than half</ENAMEX> said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families .
Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group .
Unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the super-rich .
Average household income for the sample was $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">194,000</ENAMEX> , and average net assets were reported as $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">775,000</ENAMEX> .
The goal was to learn about <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's fastest - growing income groups , the upper - middle class .
Although they represent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2 %</ENAMEX> of the population , they control <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly one - third</ENAMEX> of discretionary income .
Across the board , these consumers value quality , buy what they like rather than just what they need , and appreciate products that are distinctive .
Despite their considerable incomes and assets , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one - fourth</ENAMEX> do n't feel that they have made it .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Twenty percent</ENAMEX> do n't even feel they are financially well off .
Many of the affluent are n't comfortable with themselves , either .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 40 %</ENAMEX> do n't feel they 're more able than others .
While <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twothirds</ENAMEX> feel some guilt about being affluent , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 25 %</ENAMEX> give $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,500</ENAMEX> or more to charity <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty - five percent</ENAMEX> attend religious services regularly ; at the same time , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one 's principles .
Odds and Ends
THE NUMBER of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation 's largest banks has more than doubled since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The American Bankers Association</ENAMEX> says that women make up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47 %</ENAMEX> of officials and managers in the top <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> banks , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</ENAMEX> .
The share of minorities in those positions has risen to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</ENAMEX> ... .
Per - capita personal income in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> grew faster than inflation <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bureau of Economic Analysis</ENAMEX> .
The amount of income divvied up for each man , woman and child was $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">16,489</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.6 %</ENAMEX> from $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">15,472</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> .
Per capita personal income ranged from $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">11,116</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">23,059</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> ... .
There are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.1 million</ENAMEX> students in college <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Center for Education Statistics</ENAMEX> estimates .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 54 %</ENAMEX> are women , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 %</ENAMEX> are part - time students .
