Thank you and Goodday .
More deadly violence has erupted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the West Bank</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Barak</ENAMEX> failed to form a government of national unity .
As night fell <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> , in the town of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hebron</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> man was shot dead in an exchange of fire between <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> militiamen and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> soldiers .
There were also gun battles near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 130</ENAMEX> people have been killed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than three weeks</ENAMEX> of violence , almost all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> met with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's right wing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Likud Party</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ariel Sharon</ENAMEX> , to form an emergency unity government to deal with the crisis , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Likud</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> failed to agree on terms .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> expert <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Gulpan</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tufts University</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's fragile coalition politics may stand in the way .
Well , they have made deals with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Likud</ENAMEX> before and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Likud</ENAMEX> is not completely just <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon</ENAMEX> , there are moderates within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Likud</ENAMEX> .
So , I think they are capable of making deals with them and that 's not really the problem .
The problem is that the coalition may prevent any possibility of creating a real agreement .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> have said they will not work with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon</ENAMEX> , and here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> administration spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jake Sewart</ENAMEX> says the President is still hard at work trying to find a solution for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> crisis .
He has continued to consult with both parties and with leaders in the that we can to try to get the parties to agree on and to move forward on the agreement we reached in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> .
