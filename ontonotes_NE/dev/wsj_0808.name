<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Darman</ENAMEX> , call your office .
Embedded in the `` budget '' being concocted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - Senate conference committee is something that looks , smells and waddles like a duck .
It 's a nuisance tax on mergers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> has decided to raise <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</ENAMEX> by charging companies $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">20,000</ENAMEX> for the honor of filing the required papers under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hart - Scott - Rodino</ENAMEX> law .
Ever since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the bad days</ENAMEX> of Big is Bad antitrust enforcement , this law has required that anyone proposing a merger must make a filing describing the effects on all relevant markets .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hart - Scott</ENAMEX> filing is then reviewed and any antitrust concerns usually met .
Typically , <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hart - Scott</ENAMEX> is used now to give managers of target firms early news of a bid and a chance to use regulatory review as a delaying tactic .
The $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">20,000</ENAMEX> tax would be a small cost in a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">multibillion - dollar</ENAMEX> deal , but a serious drag on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of small , friendly deals .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> especially dangerous aspect to the new tax would be that the proceeds will be used to increase the budgets of the antitrust division at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Trade Commission</ENAMEX> .
This amounts to a bounty for regulators -- the more regulating the more they get to keep .
Also , as former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> antitrust chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Rule</ENAMEX> has noted , this would `` establish the precedent that the government may charge parties for the privilege of being sued regardless of whether the government prevails . ''
Yet another opportunity for President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> to respond , `` Read my lips .
Line - item veto .
