There may be a truce in the long war of nerves between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> over how this country conducts secret intelligence operations abroad .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> of mistrust born of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> , past misdeeds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Iran - Contra</ENAMEX> scandal , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> appear ready -- for now , at least -- to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities .
If that attitude lasts , it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that has n't been seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past week</ENAMEX> , the president has agreed to keep the committee informed , usually in advance , of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing .
That was n't always the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration handled such matters .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has pledged as well to respect the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">14 - year - old</ENAMEX> executive order barring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> never fully trusted former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Casey</ENAMEX> and National Security Adviser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Poindexter</ENAMEX> to honor the ban .
Despite objections by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> also has agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> who would be independent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> director .
In return , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> panel has dropped efforts to enact legislation requiring the administration to inform it within <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</ENAMEX> of the launching of any covert activity .
It also has removed a ban on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> use of a contingency fund for covert acts and has agreed to wipe away some tortured and legalistic restrictions on coup planning put in place to ensure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> did n't get back in the assassination game .
`` We 've finally been able to convince them that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">-LCB- Oliver -RCB- North</ENAMEX> do n't work here anymore , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> administration official .
The new understanding did n't just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light .
It emerged after a rancorous display of old - style intelligence politics that followed this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">month</ENAMEX> 's failed coup attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The White House</ENAMEX> used television appearances and leaks to argue that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> support for such coups difficult .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> even disclosed privately that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> - era deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> required him to notify the odious <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Panamanian</ENAMEX> dictator , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX> , if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life .
The president also hinted he might veto this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> 's intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Okla .</ENAMEX> -RRB- and Vice Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> -RRB- , for their part , angrily accused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> of selectively leaking classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> for the bungled attempt to topple Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The White House</ENAMEX> got the better of the exchange but took care not to press its advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought by conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> who do n't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities .
Instead , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and his aides made it clear they respected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> 's role and felt they could work with the conservative Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> and the moderate Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> to iron out their differences .
The senators responded in kind .
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> happily told reporters that there had been `` a meeting of the minds '' with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> , and that the committee had given Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> `` a clean slate , '' free of the impediments imposed during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> .
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> said the relationship has reverted to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON" S_OFF="4">pre-Reagan</ENAMEX> character .
There still are some details to be nailed down .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is reserving the right in `` rare '' instances to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> in the dark , asserting a constitutional prerogative the committee does n't recognize .
And a pending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justice Department</ENAMEX> interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled .
Moreover , both sides may face political critics .
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">conservatives</ENAMEX> will accuse the president of promising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> too much .
And they continue anonymously attacking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Webster</ENAMEX> for being too accommodating to the committee .
At the same time , some congressional liberals will accuse Sens. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> of wimping out , and they will warn that the lawmakers ' concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> harbors and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> arms sales .
But if the cooperative attitude holds and there is greater consultation on covert activities , the country could be entering <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">an era</ENAMEX> when such hare - brained schemes are scrapped before they get off the drawing boards , while risky but well - planned secret operations can be undertaken without fear that a panicky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> will balk .
