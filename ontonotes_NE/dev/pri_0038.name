In the cold and wind whipped waters of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Barents Sea</ENAMEX> , divers are trying to raise the bodies of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118</ENAMEX> sailors from the wrecked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kursk</ENAMEX> .
The nuclear submarine went down <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two months ago</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> explosions ripped through it .
Now <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Norwegian</ENAMEX> divers are making a man - sized hole in the hull .
That 's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> step in bringing the remains of the crewmembers back to shore .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Rosenberg</ENAMEX> is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Murmosk</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Rosenberg</ENAMEX> , where are they now in this salvage operation ?
How is it coming along ?
Well , the international team of deep - sea divers has made good progress <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , if you remember , the weather was extremely bad .
Storms , very high waves , very difficult conditions for the divers to work in .
But the storm has cleared <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> and from <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</ENAMEX> the divers have been down at the bottom of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Barents Sea</ENAMEX> , working on cutting out this hole in the inner hull of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kursk</ENAMEX> .
What happens once they do finish ?
Do they actually enter the submarine ?
How do they go about extracting the bodies of the submariners ?
Well , they wo n't enter straight away .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> of all they have to make sure there are no jagged edges around this hole , because <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> tear of the protective suits of the divers could prove fatal .
It is a very dangerous operation .
Then they may send in a television camera , a remote - controled television camera to have a look around and see what the conditions are like , and then , based upon the weather conditions , a decision will be made whether to go inside and begin the search for bodies .
The weather is so vital because if the weather is stormy , if the winds are strong , then it makes it extremely dangerous for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> divers who will be going inside .
The fear is that the umbilical cord linking the divers ' suits could get tangled , could get damaged , in that order of course , prove fatal .
Are there also concerns regarding disrupting the nuclear fuel aboard the submarine ?
Are there any kind of environmental concerns ?
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> officials say there are no environmental concerns at the moment .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A couple of days ago</ENAMEX> , a small hole was made in the inner hull of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">kursk</ENAMEX> and water samples were taken .
They were tested and the results came back very encouraging .
There was no hint of radiation or leaking fuel , anything like that .
So I think officials are confident that it would be safe to go inside , but having said that , once inside there are a number of dangers , which would face the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> divers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> of all , visibility will be very very low .
It 's going to be bitterly cold , and there is going to be enormous danger from jagged pieces of metal which could be swimming around in the submarine .
Given the fact that there are so many dangers and that these divers are risking their own lives , I wonder if there is consideration given to the fact that this may not be really worth it .
I mean have some suggested just leaving the sailors ' bodies there and respecting the site as a grave ?
Yes , I have to say that more and more people in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> are suggesting that this operation is not worth risking the lives of more people , risking the lives of the deep - sea divers , and in fact , many of the relatives of the crewmembers who died in this tragedy , they too are saying that the operation should be cancelled .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> many of the relatives met the chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Russian Navy</ENAMEX> and suggested the same thing , but President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> gave his word that the operation would go ahead , and it does seem as if the operation is going to continue .
Are there any new explanations coming down as to what caused this disaster in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> place ?
Well , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> the chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Russian Navy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Kuroyedov</ENAMEX> , he actually said he was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">eighty percent</ENAMEX> sure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kursk</ENAMEX> had collided with a submarine , I think .
So there has been no other official word , final word about what actually caused this tragedy .
There is a government commission which was set up to investigate the causes of the tragedy , and they whittled out a number of possible causes to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> .
They have said that it was either a collision with a foreign submarine , it could have been a collision with a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> mine , or it could have been a torpedo on board misfiring .
They simply did n't know , but as I say , Admiral <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koryerov</ENAMEX> has said he does believe it was a collision with a submarine , and they 're not sure now whether it was a foreign submarine or a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> one ?
The chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Russian Navy</ENAMEX> did n't actually specify a foreign submarine , but certainly the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> government has been suggesting all along that a foreign submarine was involved .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Rosenberg</ENAMEX> speaking to us from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mermosk</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Rosenberg</ENAMEX> , thank you for the update .
You 're welcome .
