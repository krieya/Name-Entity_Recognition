Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> and Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> spent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this day</ENAMEX> with their families , dispatching their deputies to score points on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> interview shows .
Here 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chip Reid</ENAMEX> .
Arriving at church with his family <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> --
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Good morning .</ENAMEX>
Hope you all have <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a nice Sunday</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> continued to refuse comment on the erecognize torl battle in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> , leaving it to his point men , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Daley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Christopher</ENAMEX> to defend the controversial hand recounts now under way .
This is the procedure called for by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> law .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> law provides for an opportunity for hand counts to check machine counts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher</ENAMEX> said the recounts should be completed within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a matter of days</ENAMEX> and at that point , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> campaign sources contend , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> will be in the lead in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> and on track to win the election .
Meanwhile , Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> spent the day out of public view , behind the gate of his ranch in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> , while his point man , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX> appeared on five network talk shows arguing vigorously that the hand recounts are improper and should be stopped .
This opens up tremendous possibilities for human error and indeed it opens up tremendous possibilities for something worse than human error , and for mischief .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> advisers say if they lose that argument in court <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> they may appeal , and if they lose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> , they may ask for recounts in other states , where the filing deadline has not yet passed and where the vote is close , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> , states that could help them win , even without <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> .
There could also be a recount in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> , where the race is a virtual tie .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New Mexico State Police</ENAMEX> there have impounded ballots in some counties to make sure no one tampers with them before any possible recount .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> team is also still considering other options , including going to court if the hand recount does not give them the lead in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> , so while both sides say they want to move as expeditiously as possible , both are considering strategies that could cause this fight to drag on for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</ENAMEX> .
