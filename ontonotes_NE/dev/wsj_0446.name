From a reading of the somewhat scant <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English - language</ENAMEX> medical literature on RU - 486 , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> abortion pill emerges as one of the creepiest concoctions around .
This is not only because it kills the unborn , a job at which it actually is not outstandingly efficient , zapping <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 50 % to 85 %</ENAMEX> of them depending on which study you read -LRB- prostaglandin , taken in conjunction with the pill , boosts the rate to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 %</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
By contrast , surgical abortion is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99 %</ENAMEX> effective .
Abortion via the pill is far more of an ordeal than conventional surgical abortion .
It is time - consuming -LRB- the abortion part alone lasts <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</ENAMEX> , and the clinical part comprises a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> 's worth of visits -RRB- , bloody -LRB- one woman in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Swedish</ENAMEX> trial required a transfusion , although for most it resembles a menstrual period , with bleeding lasting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">an average of 10 days</ENAMEX> -RRB- , and painful -LRB- many women require analgesic shots to ease them through -RRB- .
Nausea and vomiting are other common side effects .
Timing is of the essence with RU - 486 .
It is most effective taken <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week</ENAMEX> after a woman misses her menstrual period up through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventh week</ENAMEX> of pregnancy , when it is markedly less effective .
That is typically <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about a three - week window</ENAMEX> .
So far , all the studies have concluded that RU - 486 is `` safe . ''
But `` safe , '' in the definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie Bass</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Reproductive Health Technologies Project</ENAMEX> , means `` there 's been no evidence so far of mortality . ''
No one has researched the long - term effects of RU - 486 on a woman 's health or fertility .
The drug seems to suppress ovulation for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three to seven months</ENAMEX> after it is taken .
Some women clearly have no trouble eventually conceiving again : The studies have reported repeaters in their programs .
But there are no scientific data on this question .
Rather ominously , rabbit studies reveal that RU - 486 can cause birth defects , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lancet</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> medical journal , reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> .
However , Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Etienne - Emile Baulieu</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> physician who invented RU - 486 , wrote in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Science</ENAMEX> magazine article <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> that the rabbit - test results could not be duplicated in rats and monkeys .
The drug has a three - dimensional structure similar to that of DES , the anti-miscarriage drug that has been linked to cervical and vaginal cancer in some of the daughters of the women who took it .
All the published studies recommend that women on whom the drug proves ineffective not carry the pregnancy to term but undergo a surgical abortion .
A risk of birth defects , a sure source of lawsuits , is one reason the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical industry is steering clear of RU - 486 .
One might well ask : Why bother with this drug at all ?
Some abortion advocates have been asking themselves this very question .
RU - 486 `` probably represents a technical advance in an area where none is needed , or at least not very much , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillip Stubblefield</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Abortion Federation</ENAMEX> , at a reproductive health conference in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> .
Many physicians have expressed concern over the heavy bleeding , which occurs even if the drug fails to induce an abortion .
It typically takes from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eight to 10 years</ENAMEX> to obtain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Food and Drug Administration 's</ENAMEX> approval for a new drug , and the cost of testing and marketing a new drug can range from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70 million</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Health and Human Services Department</ENAMEX> currently forbids <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> from funding abortion research as part of its <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 million</ENAMEX> contraceptive program .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Population Council</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">37 - year - old</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</ENAMEX> nonprofit organization that has the backing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mellon</ENAMEX> foundations and currently subsidizes most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> research on contraceptives , has recently been paying for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> studies of RU - 486 on a license from its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> developer , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Roussel - Uclaf</ENAMEX> , a joint subsidiary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hoechst</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> government .
In the year since the pill went on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Organization for Women</ENAMEX> and its offshoot , former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NOW</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eleanor Smeal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fund for a Feminist Majority</ENAMEX> , have been trying to browbeat the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical industry into getting involved .
-LRB- Its scare - tactic prediction : the pill `` will be available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , either legally or illegally , in no more than 2 - 5 years . '' -RRB-
Following the feminist and population - control lead has been a generally bovine press .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1988</ENAMEX> article in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mother Jones</ENAMEX> magazine is typical of the general level of media ignorance .
`` For a woman whose period is late , using RU - 486 means no waiting , no walking past picket lines at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">abortion clinics</ENAMEX> , and no feet up in stirrups for surgery , '' burbles health writer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Fraser</ENAMEX> .
`` It also means she will never have to know whether she had actually been pregnant . ''
Wrong on all counts , Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX> .
RU - 486 is being administered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> only under strict supervision in the presence of a doctor .
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Roussel</ENAMEX> reportedly has every pill marked and accounted for to make sure none slips into the black market . -RRB-
Thus , a woman who used RU - 486 to have an abortion would have to make <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> trips to the clinic past those picket lines ; an initial visit for medical screening -LRB- anemics and those with previous pregnancy problems are eliminated -RRB- and to take the pill , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> trip <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</ENAMEX> later for the prostaglandin , administered either via injection or vaginal suppository , and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> trip <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week later</ENAMEX> to make sure she has completely aborted .
Furthermore , because timing is so critical with RU - 486 , she will learn , via a pelvic examination and ultrasound , not only that she is pregnant , but just how pregnant she is .
No doctor who fears malpractice liability would likely expose a non-pregnant patient to the risk of hemorrhaging .
Many women may even see the dead embryo they have expelled , a sight the surgical - abortion industry typically spares them .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven weeks</ENAMEX> , an embryo is <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about three - fourths of an inch long</ENAMEX> and recognizably human .
At the behest of pro-choice members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - year</ENAMEX> reauthorization bill for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title X</ENAMEX> federal family - planning assistance now contains a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</ENAMEX> grant for `` development , evaluation and bringing to the marketplace of new improved contraceptive devices , drugs and methods . ''
If this passes -- a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> version has already been cleared for a floor vote that is likely <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early next year</ENAMEX> -- it would put the federal government into the contraceptive marketing business for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time .
It also could put the government into the RU - 486 business , which would please feminists dismayed at what they view as pusillanimity in the private - sector drug industry .
We do not know whether RU - 486 will be as disastrous as some of the earlier fertility - control methods released to unblinking , uncritical cheers from educated people who should have known better .
-LRB- Remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the Dalkon Shield</ENAMEX> and the early birth - control pills ? -RRB-
We will not know until a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> generation of female guinea pigs -- all of whom will be more than happy to volunteer for the job -- has put the abortion pill through the clinical test of time .
