Thank you very much , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> have taken steps to end <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</ENAMEX> of violence , but have warned of difficulties as the clashes continue .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Barak</ENAMEX> says he doubts he can count on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> as partners for peace .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> officials say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> needs to remove soldiers from the outskirts of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> cities .
The comments were made as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> eased travel restrictions on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> as part of their efforts to end the violence by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
There were sporadic clashes in several <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> areas <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> , but on a much lesser scale than in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">previous days</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The US State Department</ENAMEX> said steps were being taken in the right direction following the emergency summit of leaders earlier this week in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sharm El - Sheikh</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> representatives traded charges <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> phase of an emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Nations General Assembly</ENAMEX> session on the violence in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Mid East</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VOA</ENAMEX> correspondent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breck Ardery</ENAMEX> reports from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the United Nations</ENAMEX> .
The chief <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> observer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nasir Al - Kidwa</ENAMEX> , told the assembly that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> has broken occupying and colonial power in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> lands .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Kidwa</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> uses savage force against <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> and then blames the victims for the violence , but <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> Ambassador <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yehud Lancry</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Palestinian Authority</ENAMEX> is helping to promote the violence by allowing extremists to appear on its radio and television broadcasts .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lancry</ENAMEX> denied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> has used excessive force saying it has simply protected its citizens .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Assembly</ENAMEX> will resume its discussion of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mid East</ENAMEX> violence on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> after receiving a report from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> Secretary General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kofi Annan</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annan</ENAMEX> will review the effect of efforts <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this week</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sharm El - Sheikh</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> to end the violence .
