<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern Airlines '</ENAMEX> creditors committee , unhappy with the carrier 's plans for emerging from bankruptcy - law proceedings , asked its own experts to devise alternate approaches to a reorganization .
Representatives of the accounting firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ernst -AMP- Young</ENAMEX> and the securities firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Goldman , Sachs -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , hired by creditors to consult on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's financial plans , told the committee in a private meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy - law protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the creditors ' approval .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> person present at the meeting , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's new plan is financially `` overly optimistic . ''
Asked about the consultants ' reports , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said `` we totally disagree . ''
She said they have `` oversimplified and made some erroneous assumptions that make their analysis completely off - base . ''
At a later news conference here , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lorenzo</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Air Corp.</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> protection from creditors <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early next year</ENAMEX> , operating with more service than it originally had scheduled .
He insisted , as he has before , that creditors would be paid in full under the plan .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> made no mention of creditors ' negative response to his plan .
`` We 're in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> told reporters .
`` We 're meeting and surpassing our goals , '' he added .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 billion</ENAMEX> in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy - law protection at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two - thirds</ENAMEX> its former size .
But after selling off pieces such as its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East Coast</ENAMEX> shuttle , its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> hub and various planes , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> hit a stumbling block .
It could n't sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South American</ENAMEX> routes , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the major assets marked for disposal .
Those routes , valued by the creditors ' professionals at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 400 million</ENAMEX> , were to be sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AMR Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Airlines</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last - minute</ENAMEX> snag in negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AMR</ENAMEX> , over an unrelated lawsuit between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American</ENAMEX> and another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Air</ENAMEX> unit , caused the deal to collapse .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> ultimately decided it would have to keep and operate the routes itself , which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization .
It also would leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> a bigger carrier than the scaled - down one proposed under the initial plan .
Those changes in its condition meant the reorganization plan previously presented to creditors would have to be revamped .
Since then , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> has been negotiating with creditors over revisions , but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions .
The committee has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> groups of experts it calls on to analyze <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's plans .
Both said the new plan would n't work .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ernst -AMP- Young</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest , tax and depreciation by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</ENAMEX> , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's plan presented no comfort level , according to a source present at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's session .
Experts from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> would miss the same mark by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 120 million to $ 135 million</ENAMEX> , the source said .
The experts said they expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> would have to issue new debt to cover its costs , and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated .
Other costs also would increase , including maintenance , because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> has an older fleet .
At the news conference , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Bakes</ENAMEX> presented a far rosier assessment .
Flanked by flight attendants , pilots and gate agents dressed in spiffy new blue uniforms , they said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats .
Starting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> will begin flying <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">775</ENAMEX> flights <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> instead of the previously announced <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</ENAMEX> , they said .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bakes</ENAMEX> declined to give out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> losses , but said he did n't expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in escrow .
These accounts hold <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">several hundred million dollars</ENAMEX> , primarily from asset sales .
The plan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> hopes to pursue , he said , calls for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> to have <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 390 million</ENAMEX> in cash by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year 's end</ENAMEX> .
Both he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> predicted that plan might be confirmed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> .
As to negotiations with creditors , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> said in remarks after the conference `` we 'll have to see how they -LCB- talks -RCB- come along . ''
However , he added , `` it 's not a requirement that the plan be accepted by creditors .
It must be accepted by the court . ''
Under bankruptcy law , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan .
That deadline has been extended once and could be extended again .
If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> can get creditor support , court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift .
But creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan , or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own .
In any event , some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> as forecast by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bakes</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> sought bankruptcy - law protection <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</ENAMEX> after a crippling strike began <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March 4</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> told reporters the reorganization <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> is pursuing would create a carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 % to 90 %</ENAMEX> of the size of the pre-bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern</ENAMEX> .
He projected it would be operating <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1,000</ENAMEX> flights a day by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late spring</ENAMEX> , only slightly fewer than the carrier 's old volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,050</ENAMEX> a day .
