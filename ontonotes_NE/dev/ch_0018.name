She 's going to help me out .
I said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kara</ENAMEX> you know why she 's going to do that is because she wants the kid to stay there so she can see your grandson .

I said you 're being used .

And what 's right for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kara</ENAMEX> will be right for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> .

you know what
I could never be with someone who did n't love me .
Could you ?
Hell no .
I do n't get that .
I do n't get that .
Anyway so I spouted my mouth off
Well I Good for you . I have to tell you
the week before I met %uh the %uh sergeant and lieutenant at the %uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Des Moines</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald</ENAMEX> 's because they were dropping off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> .
Sergeant and lieutenant ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennings</ENAMEX> .
%huh ?
Sergeant and lieutenant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennings</ENAMEX> .
You talking about mom and dad ?
yeah .
%eh here 's why I call them that .
So we 're sitting there in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald</ENAMEX> 's p-
and I 'm
they had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> for a week
and %uh we 're visiting
and , and %uh they start in on me right away .
And you keep your mouth shut
and you do n't say this
and you do n't say that and do n't say this and do n't say that .
It was the whole time was %uh was nothing but a big fucking lecture .
You say oh I 've got to go .
So I think , I think I did that on purpose .
Good for you .
Well then the following weekend was father 's day .
And %uh we were supposed to all meet in Des M-
339.00_347.11_A: oh that was to drop <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> off .
okay .
yeah .
And then we 're going to meet and pick <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> up and see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kara</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> .
I 've never seen that kid .
Have no clue what he ,
well you have n't either .
uh-uh .
So %um we get there
and there 's dad with his hands in his pocket
and he meets us out at the car
and , and %uh %um mom was sitting on the bench for once not huddling around dad .
And %um I said where 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kara</ENAMEX> .
He said well she did n't come .
And I said what .
He said no she did n't come .
She %uh she did n't like the last <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> conversations that she had with you .
She %uh does n't , did n't like what you s- you had to say to her .
So they still backing her .
And you want to know something ?
What ?
They probably told her it was okay not to come .
They probably said yeah we do n't like how she talks to us either .
I bet ,
what do you want to bet because do n't you think they could have made her come ?
yeah .
They would 've made anybody else come .
Sure .
They would 've said get your ass in the car . Whether y-
Say god damn we do n't want to hear no fucking shit .
Let 's go .
Whether you 're <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty - six</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty - six</ENAMEX> it do n't matter .
yeah .
You would 've been in that god damn car .
Well it was just like well we 'll show her for spouting her mouth off .
She wo n't get to see the baby .
yeah .
Exactly .
We 'll punish her .
So then he just calls .
The old man just calls me and says I got my messy mess- message machine and says %uh yeah we want to we want <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX> to come out .
We do n't think it 's fair that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX> ca n't come out .
And %uh cause I , I , I said I 'm not going to meet them in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Des Moines</ENAMEX> . I c- , I ca n't be with them <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tad</ENAMEX> .
I get I , I lose <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</ENAMEX> of my life every time I 'm with them .
Mentally I ca n't take it .
Well why do you think nobody else has no -- I , I ca n't , I ca n't do it anymore . -- contact with them .
I , I just ca n't .
I mean that pissed me off the last time they were here
so .
But it 's never their fault .
It 's never for anything that they 've done .
I know that
and I mean i- i- you get blamed ,
you still get blamed for shit and , and lectured about shit that happens when you 're a kid or , or , or whatever and all that I mean .
Well I do n't get it for that
but %um so then dad , dad says now why do n't you want to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Des Moines</ENAMEX>
and I said because I do n't .
I said I thought we 'd already been through this cause I already told them I did n't want to go to Des M-AMP-oines .
And he goes well then we 'll drive to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omaha</ENAMEX> and pick up sh- %um <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX>
and , and then %uh we 'll bring him back and then we 'll %uh bring him back home to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omaha</ENAMEX> .
And I said %mm . oh so you 're not
and the whole thing is that I wo n't let them stay in my house anymore . Because I ca n't have that twenty - four hour bitching and negative .
I ca n't .
I ca n't live like that .
yeah .
yeah .
You know what I 'm saying ?
mhm .
It 's just <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty - four hours</ENAMEX> .
So %um I said so , so let me understand this
so you 're coming ,
you 're picking him up
and you 're leaving ?
You 're not staying ?
Right .
And I go %hm well it sounds like we 're back to the same old argument .
And %um I said so you 're going to punish me because you 're offended that I do n't particularly want you to stay here in my home .
Well no it 's not punishing .
I said well then what do you call it .
I mean I just came out and said it .
yeah .
No you just do n't un-
I said no dad . I think it 's you do n't understand .
You do n't understand how you affect my family . You and mom . And and more importantly how you affect me .
And he said that 's your problem .
You think too much about yourself .
And I said goodbye dad .
%hm .
And I hung the phone up .
Good for you .
Why does , why does our life have to be like this ?
I do n't get it .
Well they 're the ones who created it .
They 're n-
Why do they have to be like that ?
I do n't know
and
Dad
You know what I said to dad when he met me at the %um when he came up to our door and said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kara</ENAMEX> 's not coming cause she does n't like y- you know what I said to him
What ?
I said I hope that my , my sons never treat one another like this .
True .
I do n't think my kids will be that way .
And he just looked at me .
Well you 've got a point
but
