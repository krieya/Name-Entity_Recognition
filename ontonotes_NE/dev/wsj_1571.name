In finding `` good news '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Berkeley</ENAMEX> 's new freshman admissions plan -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Privileged Class</ENAMEX> , '' editorial , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 20</ENAMEX> -RRB- , you 're reading the headline but not the story .
The plan indeed raises from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria .
But that does n't mean `` <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> of the students attending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Berkeley</ENAMEX> '' will be admitted this way .
The plan is talking about applicants admitted , not students who enroll .
Since the `` yield '' from this top slice of applicants is relatively low , boosting admits from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> will boost registrants from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 31 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38 %</ENAMEX> of the class .
In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">perhaps 5 %</ENAMEX> of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials `` narrowly missed '' gaining them admission in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> category .
But against that combined increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</ENAMEX> in students chosen by academic criteria , the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades , test scores and `` supplemental points '' for factors such as high - school curriculum , <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> - language proficiency and an essay .
This category now accounts for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 19 %</ENAMEX> of admits and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</ENAMEX> of registrants .
The plan thus will decrease by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</ENAMEX> , for a net loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> , the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria .
Who will take over these places ?
The plan creates a new category of students from `` socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds , '' a concept not yet defined , and gives them <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 %</ENAMEX> of the class .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of the plan 's authors has defended the `` socioeconomic disadvantage '' category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative - action preferences based on race .
Perhaps it does .
But the new category does not replace or reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Berkeley</ENAMEX> 's broad racial preferences .
Nor will students from racial - minority groups who are admitted through the new category be counted against the affirmative - action `` target '' for their group .
The plan thus places a large new affirmative - action program , based on `` socioeconomic disadvantage , '' on top of the existing program based on race .
The role of academic criteria in choosing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Berkeley</ENAMEX> 's freshmen can only decline as a result .
