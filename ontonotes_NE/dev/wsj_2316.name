The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , which is finalizing its steel - import quotas , is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries .
Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> has negotiated a significant cut in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's steel quota , and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Community</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> , similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> , is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> market than it had under the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year</ENAMEX> steel quotas , which expired <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 30</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</ENAMEX> countries that have n't completed steel talks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year ending Oct. 1 , 1990</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> steelmakers have supplied <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the 100 million tons</ENAMEX> of steel used <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</ENAMEX> by the nation .
Of the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</ENAMEX> needed , the steel - quota negotiations allocate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 %</ENAMEX> to foreign suppliers , with the difference supplied mainly by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> -- which is n't included in the quota program .
Other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX> , also have supplied steel .
Some of these countries have in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> made informal agreements with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> that are similar to quotas .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> said it would extend steel quotas , known as voluntary restraint agreements , until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March 31 , 1992</ENAMEX> .
It also said it would use that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - and - a - half year</ENAMEX> period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade , which has been notoriously managed , subsidized and protected by governments .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> termed its plan , a `` trade liberalization program , '' despite the fact that it is merely an extension .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , which was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> countries to conclude its steel talks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , virtually doubled its quota to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.95 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> steel market from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.48 %</ENAMEX> under the previous quotas .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> , which had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.9 %</ENAMEX> under the previous quotas , is set to get a small increase to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1.95 %</ENAMEX> .
That increase rises to slightly more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> market if a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Korean</ENAMEX> - U.S. steel project is included .
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> is expected to increase its allowance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.43 %</ENAMEX> share it has had in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's largest steel suppliers -- have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> steel industry , which has been coping with strong <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> demand , has been supplying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> market compared with recent quotas of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 6.7 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> has been shipping steel to total <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 4.5 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> market compared with a quota of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.9 %</ENAMEX> .
In the recent talks , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> had its quota increased <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 300,000 tons</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> market from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.7 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> .
But its quota has been as high as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.9 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , however , has agreed to cut its quota to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.9 %</ENAMEX> previously .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80 %</ENAMEX> of the steel imported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> under the quota program .
The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about an extra 2 %</ENAMEX> of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks .
That was essentially made up of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</ENAMEX> increase in the overall quota program and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</ENAMEX> from cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's allowance .
Negotiators from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> trade office will repeat these quota negotiations <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> when they will have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">another 1 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> steel market to allocate .
These optional <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</ENAMEX> - a - year increases to the steel quota program are built into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration 's steel - quota program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries .
