In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's total amount of foreign trade broke through <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">220 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> , which created a new historical record .
However , in reviewing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's foreign trade situation <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , it might be appropriate to say that it is between joy and sorrow .
The joy lies in that the total amount of foreign trade still maintains a strong growth momentum , and has realized trade surpluses for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third year in a row</ENAMEX> , whereas the sorrow is that the amount of trade surplus has sharply reversed , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , a relatively large deficit may appear .
According to official journals published recently by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury Department</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's foreign trade in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> continued to grow rapidly , the total amount of imports and exports reached <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">220.178 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.85 %</ENAMEX> higher than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</ENAMEX> , and within that the amount of exports was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">110.380 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> , the amount of imports was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">109.798 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.7 %</ENAMEX> higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> , respectively .
The trade surplus was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">582 million US dollars</ENAMEX> .
Foreign trade occupies a pivotal position in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's economy .
At present , exports account for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 30 %</ENAMEX> of its GDP , which is one of the primary economic growth forces .
After the outbreak of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's financial crisis in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's currency , the peso was greatly devalued , thus greatly strengthening <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's export competitiveness .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last several years</ENAMEX> , the government has been vigorously supporting exports , and exports grew rapidly .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> , the situation of successive foreign trade deficit reversed , and up to now , has maintained trade surpluses for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years in a row</ENAMEX> .
However , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's foreign trade surplus showed a substantial degradation : <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.889 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.424 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only 582 million US dollars</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
Especially deserving to be pointed out is that , after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> monthly deficit in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the rest of the year</ENAMEX> saw successive monthly deficits with the amounts of deficit almost doubling , roaring from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 million US dollars</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">722 million US dollars</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> , reducing the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> annual accumulative trade surplus amount to a trivial number .
Local economic analysts felt that the trade deficit in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half of last year</ENAMEX> was mainly due to an overly high import growth rate , which is even higher than that of exports .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half of last year</ENAMEX> , the average growth rate of imports was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 % to 7 %</ENAMEX> higher than that of exports .
Among import sectors , swift growth comes mainly from imports of consumer products and capital goods , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39.9 %</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38.2 %</ENAMEX> higher than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> respectively .
The growth of imports of semi-finished products was up by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.8 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</ENAMEX> , the overly high valuation of the peso is also an indispensable factor .
An overly high peso exchange rate stimulated imports , but hindered exports .
It is commonly known that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</ENAMEX> , before the outbreak of the financial crisis , the trade deficit was once as high as <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 18 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> .
The huge trade deficit was one of the internal reasons that triggered this crisis .
Hence , the trade situation <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> has caused extreme concern among people from economic circles , who even predicted that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> , foreign trade deficit would revive .
They pointed out that , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , except for an overly high peso exchange rate , exports would also face some new unfavorable factors .
For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> currency devaluation will decrease export competitiveness , and the fall of oil price will significantly reduce oil revenues .
Under these circumstances , if the import growth momentum can not be restrained , this year , a trade deficit of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 to 5 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> may appear .
