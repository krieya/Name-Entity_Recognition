<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> newspapers published a human tragedy and a moral scandal of the temporary tourist marriage called " <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mutaa</ENAMEX> " , which <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">some Arab Shiites</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> have been practicing for years .
They go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> every year .
They are elderly and they have money , and they marry poor , young <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslim</ENAMEX> girls .
After a month , the husband flees and returns to his country , abandoning wife and children , particularly if the wife is pregnant .
He even gives them false information about his address , so that he can run away from responsibility for the children .
One of these people continued to marry every year , for more than twenty years .
The last time he married a girl that turned out to be his daughter from his first tourist marriage in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> .
The problem turned into a tragedy and a scandal for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> media .
This kind of spurious marriage , which takes advantage of girls ' poverty , caused awful human tragedies .
Many children produced by this marriage live without any identity , nationality or support .
Some countries imposed strict rules to protect girls from this type of injustice , by imposing harsh restrictions on marriage to foreigners .
