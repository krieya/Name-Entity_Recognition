<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> leaders have bottled up President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's capital - gains tax cut in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> and may be able to prevent a vote on the issue indefinitely .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> -RRB- said he intends to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> procedures to force advocates of the tax cut to come up with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 60</ENAMEX> votes before they can address the issue .
And neither <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> are predicting that the capital - gains forces can produce enough votes .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</ENAMEX> - vote requirement will be there and they do n't have the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</ENAMEX> votes , '' Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> said .
`` They do n't have the votes to get it passed . ''
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Packwood</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ore.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> proponent of the tax cut , did n't disagree .
`` I 'm not sure what 's going to happen , '' he said .
Previously he had said he would be able to find the requisite <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</ENAMEX> votes eventually .
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> has offered his capital - gains - cut package as an amendment to a bill , now pending in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> , that would authorize aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> are holding up a vote on the amendment by threatening a filibuster , or extended debate .
For a cloture vote to stop the filibuster , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> must muster <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 60</ENAMEX> votes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> acknowledged , `` We do n't have the votes for cloture <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> show no sign of relenting .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> leaders continued to press for a vote on the amendment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> aid measure .
And they threatened to try to amend any other revenue bill in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> with the capital - gains provision .
`` This is serious business ; we 're serious about a capital - gains reduction , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dole</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> leader .
`` The strategy is ` Let 's vote . ' ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> contend that they can garner a majority in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> - member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> for a capital - gains tax cut .
They accuse the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> of unfairly using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> rules to erect a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</ENAMEX> - vote hurdle .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> counter that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> have often used the same rules to suit their own ends .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides also traded accusations about the cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> plan .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> asserted that the proposal , which also would create a new type of individual retirement account , was fraught with budget gimmickry that would lose <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</ENAMEX> in the long run .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> countered that long - range revenue estimates were unreliable .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held .
It also would create a new IRA that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes , including retirement , medical expenses , first - home purchases and tuition .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> spokesman said President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is `` generally supportive '' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> plan .
