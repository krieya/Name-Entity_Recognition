The envelope arrives in the mail .
Open it and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> soulful eyes on a boy 's brown face peer out from the page , pleadingly .
Does the tyke have a good mind about to be wasted ?
Is he a victim of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gramm</ENAMEX> - Rudman cuts ?
No , but he 's endangered all the same : His new sitcom on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> needs a following to stay on the air .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> has n't had much luck with shows featuring blacks in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , and the producers of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> new arrival are a bit desperate .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Homeroom</ENAMEX> , '' a show about a black ad executive who gives up the boardroom for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> - grade classroom , is flunking the ratings test .
So producers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alyce</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Topper Carew</ENAMEX> spun their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rolodexes</ENAMEX> and gathered names of black opinion makers to mount a direct - mail campaign .
By wooing a core black audience they figure they might keep the show alive at least until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring semester</ENAMEX> .
Using direct mail for a TV show is like fishing for whale with a breaded hook .
It just is n't done .
But employing this kind of gut - wrenching plea to black consciousness makes it even more unusual .
Still , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carew</ENAMEX> thinks he can reach a good chunk of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three million - plus</ENAMEX> black homes he needs by mailing to the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 10,000</ENAMEX> blacks who form what he calls `` the grapevine . ''
`` The grapevine is n't organized , but you and I know it exists , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carew</ENAMEX> , referring to the often uncannily small world of black professionals and community leaders .
`` This is a very personal , ethnic style , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carew</ENAMEX> says . ``
I want people in the barber shops and the beauty shops and standing in line at the rib joints to be talking about the show .
I want white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> to talk about it , too , but I 'm convinced that the grapevine is what 's happening . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> says it is aware of the producers ' action , but the mailing was sent without the network 's blessing .
The letter , in fact , takes a jab at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> for being a laggard in black programming .
Meanwhile , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</ENAMEX> show struggles to stay afloat against the tough competition of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">`` Murder , She Wrote</ENAMEX> , '' the grapevine idea is threatening to turn into a weed : The tactic apparently has inspired sample viewings , but accolades are slow in coming .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Alligood</ENAMEX> , a black advertising executive who tracks black viewing patterns , gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carews</ENAMEX> an `` A '' for marketing moxie , but is n't alone in his lukewarm reaction .
Some shows just do n't impress , he says , and this is one of them .
