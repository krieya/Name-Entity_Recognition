<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Bennett</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> drug - policy director , accused local officials in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> area of blocking construction of prison facilities to house convicted drug dealers .
`` Politics has essentially put up a roadblock '' to finding sites for new federal prisons , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> said at a news conference called to report on his `` emergency assistance program '' for the capital .
Without more space to incarcerate convicted criminals , he added , `` we will not win the war on drugs . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> declared in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April</ENAMEX> that he would make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> a `` test case '' for how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration would aid cities afflicted by heavy drug trafficking and violence .
The drug czar claimed that enforcement efforts are working here , `` albeit at a slower and more halting pace than we would like . ''
He acknowledged , however , that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> 's `` drug - related murder rate is intolerably high .
The prisons are too crowded .
Drugs continue to be sold openly around schools , parks and housing projects . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> declined to name the area officials who he believes have impeded plans for building more federal prisons to ease <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> 's problem .
But other <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration officials have criticized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Schaefer</ENAMEX> for blocking the use of possible sites in that state .
Administration officials also have said that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marion Barry</ENAMEX> has delayed consideration of sites in the city .
In a letter to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> 's office , released <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> 's city administrator , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol Thompson</ENAMEX> , complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug - related assistance provided to the capital .
Referring to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> 's claim that the federal government would provide <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 97 million</ENAMEX> in emergency federal support , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> wrote , `` Our analysis was unable to even come close to documenting that figure . ''
Of his successes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">375</ENAMEX> local inmates .
He also noted that the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drug Enforcement Administration</ENAMEX> has established a federal - local task force responsible since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106</ENAMEX> arrests and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 2 million</ENAMEX> in seizures of drug dealers ' assets .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Defense Department</ENAMEX> has lent the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> prosecutors , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Bureau of Investigation</ENAMEX> has provided crime laboratory facilities and training , he added .
