Now to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> , where a people 's revolt over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few days</ENAMEX> has led to a dramatic change .
A new President was officially sworn in today , bringing an end to the reign of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Maceda</ENAMEX> reports from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> .
In a simple ceremony before the newly elected parliament , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vojislav Kostunica</ENAMEX> took his oath of office <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">late tonight</ENAMEX> as President of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> , marking the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">13 years</ENAMEX> of autocratic rule under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> .
It was a scene few <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Serbs</ENAMEX> would have deemed possible <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only weeks ago</ENAMEX> , but it almost did n't happen , delayed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> 's party , which still controls the parliament .
After meetings <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">earlier today</ENAMEX> with a series of foreign dignitaries , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kostunica</ENAMEX> admitted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> may be down , but not out .
`` difficult times are behind us , '' he said , `` but <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the days ahead</ENAMEX> also hold many trials . ''
His main priority -- bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> back into the international community after a decade of economic sanctions .
Many believe he has the credentials .
A man who believes in democracy but who holds strong <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Serb</ENAMEX> views .
Seen here armed with a machine gun , supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Serb</ENAMEX> cause in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> .
In a recent interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC News</ENAMEX> , highly critical of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> policy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Balkans</ENAMEX> , especially the indictment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> for war crimes .
In some sense , it is sort of interfering in the affairs of another state .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kostunica</ENAMEX> had already publicly said he would never turn <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hague</ENAMEX> tribunal .
Then , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , just before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> publicly conceded defeat , a <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">one - hour</ENAMEX> meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kostunica</ENAMEX> -- their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> ever -- said to be cordial .
Details have yet to be revealed , but at the very least , sources say , there was an exchange of guarantees for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kostunica</ENAMEX> , a peaceful hand - over of power , and in return , safety and comfort inside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> even intends to continue his political career , as leader of his party , worrying many who opposed him .
As long as he 's on the soil of this state , no one will be able to sleep quietly .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Tonight</ENAMEX> , despite poor weather , thousands of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Serbs</ENAMEX> celebrated a new era of freedom , with the fate of their former dictator still in doubt .
