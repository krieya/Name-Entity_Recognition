Battle - tested <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> industrial managers here always buck up nervous newcomers with the tale of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> of their countrymen to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , a boatload of samurai warriors blown ashore <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">375 years ago</ENAMEX> .
`` From the beginning , it took a man with extraordinary qualities to succeed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimihide Takimura</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsui</ENAMEX> group 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kensetsu Engineering Inc.</ENAMEX> unit .
Here in this new center for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> assembly plants just across the border from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> , turnover is dizzying , infrastructure shoddy , bureaucracy intense .
Even after - hours drag ; `` karaoke '' bars , where <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> revelers sing over recorded music , are prohibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's powerful musicians union .
Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> companies , including giants such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sanyo Industries Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Matsushita Electronics Components Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> have set up shop in the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern Baja</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> .
Keeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> happy will be one of the most important tasks facing conservative leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernesto Ruffo</ENAMEX> when he takes office <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 1</ENAMEX> , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> opposition governor in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's modern history .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , with its desperate need for investment , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , with its huge budget surplus , would seem like a perfect match .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries remain separated by a cultural barrier wider than the ocean .
Conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investors are put off by what they consider <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's restrictive investment regulations and loose work habits .
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mexicans</ENAMEX> ' viewpoint , vaunted tactics of methodical <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> managers do n't count for much in a land where a saying says `` there are no fixed rules . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> ranks as only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> largest foreign investor in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> of the total investments .
That is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 1 %</ENAMEX> of all the money <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> has invested abroad .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mexican</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Salinas de Gortari</ENAMEX> would like to change that .
The young president so admires <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> discipline that he sends his children to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> school in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX> .
He already has finagled a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</ENAMEX> loan from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> government .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> urgently needs more help .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> 's unpopular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Institutional Revolutionary Party</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PRI</ENAMEX> , faces congressional elections in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> .
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PRI</ENAMEX> to stand a chance , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> has to press on with an economic program that so far has succeeded in lowering inflation and providing moderate economic growth .
But maintaining the key components of his strategy -- a stable exchange rate and high level of imports -- will consume enormous amounts of foreign exchange .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> needs big investment inflows -- quickly .
The problem is that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> businesses make decisions with a view well beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming months</ENAMEX> that weigh so heavily on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> will come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , but not immediately , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kazushige Suzuki</ENAMEX> , director - general of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Japanese External Trade Organization</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> .
If not now , when ?
`` When the fruit is ripe , it falls from the tree by itself , '' he says .
Pressed on the matter , he is more specific .
`` There will be big <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investments probably <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five to 10 years from now</ENAMEX> . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryukichi Imai</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , agrees that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> may be too eager .
`` There seems to be a presumption in some sectors of -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's -RRB- government that there is a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> money waiting behind the gate , and that by slightly opening the gate , that money will enter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> .
I do n't think that is the case . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mexican</ENAMEX> officials maintain the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> reserve is only a result of unfamiliarity .
`` Because of distance , it takes a while for them to appreciate the economic stability we 've achieved , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> economic policymaker .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> is sending a number of missions to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> looking for a major breakthrough investment in telecommunications , petrochemicals or tourism .
It is hoped that other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> would then follow the leader .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investors say that their reluctance to invest stems not only from concerns about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's economic outlook , but also reservations about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's recently revamped investment law .
Unable to get a new law through a congress with a strong leftist bloc , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> jury - rigged the existing law 's regulations .
It created special <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 - year</ENAMEX> trusts to allow foreigners <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</ENAMEX> ownership in some once - closed industries .
It also made artful use of semantics , redefining as non-strategic industries some that had been in the national domain .
`` Those devices do n't give sufficient certainty to our bosses in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasuo Nakamura</ENAMEX> , representative of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Industrial Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nakamura</ENAMEX> cites the case of a customer who wants to build a giant tourism complex in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baja</ENAMEX> and has been trying for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</ENAMEX> to get around <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mexican</ENAMEX> restrictions on foreign ownership of beachfront property .
He could develop the beach through a trust , but instead is trying have his grandson become a naturalized <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mexican</ENAMEX> so his family gains direct control .
Some say the best hope for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mexicans</ENAMEX> is catching the eye of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> by promoting the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> industry the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> clearly like -- the border assembly plants , known as `` maquiladoras , '' which are open to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</ENAMEX> foreign control .
`` We must do more to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baja</ENAMEX> if we want them to invest elsewhere , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruffo</ENAMEX> , the governor - elect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Action Party</ENAMEX> and himself a succesful businessman .
Plant operators are heartened by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruffo</ENAMEX> 's pledge to cut corruption associated with the ruling party officials .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruffo</ENAMEX> frets that an even bigger problem could be protectionism from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , where some politicians oppose what they consider <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> efforts to use maquiladoras to crack the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> market through the back door .
