Bond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt .
But while the overall market improved , the new - issue junk - bond market continued to count casualties , even as junk - bond prices rose .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential - Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> said it postponed a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 220 million</ENAMEX> senior subordinated debenture offering by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">York International Corp</ENAMEX> .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Donaldson , Lufkin -AMP- Jenrette Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 475 million</ENAMEX> debenture offering by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chicago -AMP- North Western Acquisition Corp.</ENAMEX> that was still being negotiated <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">late last night</ENAMEX> .
The issue by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chicago -AMP- North Western</ENAMEX> is one of the so - called good junk - bond offerings on the new - issue calendar .
Some analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern 's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week 's</ENAMEX> junk - bond market debacle , many new issues of high - yield , high - risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back , delayed or dropped .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> had to slash the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Continental Airlines '</ENAMEX> junk - bond offering to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 71 million</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> has delayed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grand Union Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.16 billion</ENAMEX> junk - bond offering while it restructures the transaction .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grand Union</ENAMEX> offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential - Bache</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">York</ENAMEX> issue was delayed because of market conditions .
`` Everything is going through firehoops right now , and -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chicago -AMP- North Western</ENAMEX> -RCB- is no exception , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mariel Clemensen</ENAMEX> , vice president , high - yield research , at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citicorp</ENAMEX> .
Portfolio managers say sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk - bond deals .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Baldwin</ENAMEX> , managing director of high - yield investments at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chancellor Capital Management</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chicago -AMP- North Western</ENAMEX> offering was restructured in part because `` several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package .
If you 're going to take the risk in this market , you want something extra . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baldwin</ENAMEX> likes the offering .
But several mutual - fund managers , nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk - bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues , said they 're staying away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class .
While they consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chicago -AMP- North Western</ENAMEX> issue to be good , they do n't view it as the best .
To lure buyers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chicago -AMP- North Western</ENAMEX> bonds , portfolio managers said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Donaldson Lufkin</ENAMEX> sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> equity kicker .
The bonds are expected to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 1/2 %</ENAMEX> coupon rate .
The equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> of the stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNW Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chicago -AMP- North Western 's</ENAMEX> parent company .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Donaldson Lufkin</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the restructuring .
According to some analysts familiar with the negotiations , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">the 10 %</ENAMEX> of equity would come directly from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Donaldson Lufkin</ENAMEX> and a fund affiliated with the investment bank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blackstone Group</ENAMEX> , which would reduce their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNW</ENAMEX> equity holdings by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> each .
That would leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blackstone</ENAMEX> fund with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> stake and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Donaldson Lufkin</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</ENAMEX> .
Despite the problems with new issues , high - yield bonds showed gains in the secondary , or resell , market .
Junk bonds ended <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one - half</ENAMEX> point higher with so - called high - quality issues from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RJR Capital Holdings Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership</ENAMEX> rising <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> point .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> market , the benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond rose <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven - eighths</ENAMEX> point , or $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.75</ENAMEX> for each $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> face amount .
The gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is moderating while the economy slows .
That raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Labor Department</ENAMEX> reported that consumer prices rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 0.2 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> , slightly lower than some economists had expected .
But there were also rumors <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> that several <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long - term bonds while selling shorter - term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasurys</ENAMEX> .
Short - term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities ended narrowly mixed , with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> notes posting slight declines while <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - year</ENAMEX> notes were slightly higher .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> executed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - day</ENAMEX> matched sales , a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system .
The move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">the 8 3/4 %</ENAMEX> at which it has been hovering around during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past week</ENAMEX> .
The closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans .
It is considered an early signal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> credit policy changes .
`` The fact that they did <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - day</ENAMEX> matched sales means they are not in a mood to ease aggressively .
They are telling us that -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 3/4 %</ENAMEX> -RCB- is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Chandross</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyds Bank PLC</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> Securities
The benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond was quoted late at a price of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101 25/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.955 %</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 29/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.032 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> .
The latest <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> notes were quoted late at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 9/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.937 %</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 26/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.007 %</ENAMEX> .
Short - term rates rose <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
The discount rate on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - month</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills rose to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.56 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.51 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> , while the rate on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> bills rose to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.57 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.53 %</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> sold <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.75 billion</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">52 - week</ENAMEX> bills <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
The average yield on the bills was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.35 %</ENAMEX> , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.61 %</ENAMEX> at the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">52 - week</ENAMEX> bill auction <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 21</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> 's yield was the lowest since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.22 %</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July 27</ENAMEX> .
Here are details of the auction :
Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it .
The percentage rates are calculated on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a 360 - day year</ENAMEX> , while the coupon - equivalent yield is based on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a 365 - day year</ENAMEX> .
Corporate Issues
Junk bond price climbed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> despite skittishness in the new - issue market for high - yield securities .
Dealers said junk bond issues on average were up by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/4 to 1/2</ENAMEX> point with so - called quality issues from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RJR Capital Holdings Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership</ENAMEX> posting <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - point gains .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Petrolane Gas Service 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 1/4 %</ENAMEX> debentures traded at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102</ENAMEX> , after trading around par <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this week</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RJR</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 1/2 %</ENAMEX> subordinated debentures of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</ENAMEX> were at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101 5/8</ENAMEX> after trading at below par <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this week</ENAMEX> .
Investment - grade bonds were unchanged .
Municipals
Activity was brisk in the high - grade general obligation market , as a series of sell lists hit the Street and capped upward price movement in the sector .
Traders estimated that <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 140 million</ENAMEX> of high - grade bonds was put up for sale via bid - wanted lists circulated by a handful of major brokers .
There was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank 's portfolios .
According to market participants , the bonds were met with decent bids , but the volume of paper left high grades in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> and under maturity range unchanged to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</ENAMEX> percentage point higher in yield .
Away from the general obligation sector , activity was modest .
Long dollar bonds were flat to up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/8</ENAMEX> point .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.20 %</ENAMEX> issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</ENAMEX> was up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/8</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 3/8</ENAMEX> bid to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 7.32 %</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</ENAMEX> percentage point .
The debt of some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> issuers pulled off lows reached after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> 's massive earthquake , although traders said market participants remained cautious .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.06 billion</ENAMEX> in general fund reserves to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">the estimated $ 500 million to $ 1 billion</ENAMEX> in damages resulting from the quake , according to a state official .
It 's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cindy Katz</ENAMEX> , assistant director of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's department of finance , although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose is n't anticipated .
Meanwhile , new issuance was slow .
The largest sale in the competitive arena was a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55.7 million</ENAMEX> issue of school financing bonds from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Virginia Public School Authority</ENAMEX> .
A balance of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25.8 million</ENAMEX> remained in late order - taking , according to the lead manager .
Mortgage - Backed Securities
Mortgage securities generally ended <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6/32 to 9/32</ENAMEX> point higher , but lagged gains in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> market because of a shift in the shape of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Premium Government National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> securities with coupon rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</ENAMEX> and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> to speed the refinancing of government - subsidized mortgages .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</ENAMEX> securities were down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1/4</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109 30/32</ENAMEX> .
If the refinancing plan clears <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> , there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities , hurting any investor paying much above par for them .
In the current - coupon sector , a shift in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> yield curve resulting from the better performance of long - dated issues over short - dated securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> securities ended at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 6/32</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/32</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> securities were at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97 10/32</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6/32</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> issue was yielding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.42 %</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">12 - year</ENAMEX> average life assumption , as the spread above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> note widened <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</ENAMEX> percentage point to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.48</ENAMEX> .
While Remic issuance may slow in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming days</ENAMEX> because of the shift in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> yield curve , underwriters continued to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits structured when the yield curve was more favorable .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> new Remics totaling <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 900 million</ENAMEX> were announced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
Foreign Bonds
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic policy address <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</ENAMEX> by Chancellor of the Exchequer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 3/4 %</ENAMEX> bond due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2003/2007</ENAMEX> was down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2/32</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111 29/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.09 %</ENAMEX> , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 3/4 %</ENAMEX> notes due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> were unchanged at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 19/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.94 %</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , the bellwether No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</ENAMEX> bond of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> ended off <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95.72</ENAMEX> , to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.32 %</ENAMEX> , and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</ENAMEX> benchmark issue due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1999</ENAMEX> ended <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05 point</ENAMEX> lower at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99.85</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.02 %</ENAMEX> .
