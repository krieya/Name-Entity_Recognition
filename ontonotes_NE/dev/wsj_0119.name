Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> are warning that a complicated new funding device for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
The funding mechanism , which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , would affect the antitrust operations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Trade Commission</ENAMEX> .
As a part of overall efforts to reduce spending , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> cut by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration 's request for antitrust enforcement for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> , which began <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 1</ENAMEX> .
To offset the reduction , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> approved a $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">20,000</ENAMEX> fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers , acquisitions and certain other transactions .
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> , led by Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Brooks</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> -RRB- , unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justice Department</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FTC</ENAMEX> officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them .
`` It could operate to augment our budget , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Rill</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Justice Department 's</ENAMEX> antitrust chief , said in an interview .
Under measures approved by both houses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> , the administration 's request for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 47 million</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Antitrust Division</ENAMEX> would be cut <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FTC</ENAMEX> budget request of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70 million</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 34 million</ENAMEX> of which would go for antitrust enforcement , would also be cut by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</ENAMEX> .
The administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> as was appropriated in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1989</ENAMEX> .
The offsetting fees would apply to filings made under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Hart - Scott - Rodino Act</ENAMEX> .
Under that law , parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</ENAMEX> or more must notify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FTC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justice Department</ENAMEX> antitrust regulators before completing the transactions .
Currently , the government charges nothing for such filings .
Proponents of the funding arrangement predict that , based on recent filing levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2,000</ENAMEX> a year , the fees will yield <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 40 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this fiscal year</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</ENAMEX> more than the budget cuts .
`` When you do that , there is not a cut , but there is in fact a program increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million</ENAMEX> '' each for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FTC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> , Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal Smith</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> -RRB- said during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> debate .
But Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Edwards</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif</ENAMEX> . -RRB- responded that a recession could stifle merger activity , reducing the amount of fees collected .
The antitrust staffs of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FTC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justice Department</ENAMEX> were cut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 40 %</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration , and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> is not the time to signal that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwards</ENAMEX> argued .
Any money in excess of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</ENAMEX> collected from the fees in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> would go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> at large .
Corporate lawyers said the new fees would n't inhibit many mergers or other transactions .
Though some lawyers reported that prospective acquirers were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect , government officials said they had n't noticed any surge in filings .
