The rationale for responding to your customers ' needs faster than the competition can is clear : Your company will benefit in terms of market share , customer satisfaction and profitability .
In fact , managers <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> are probably more aware of speed as a competitive variable than ever before .
However , for many , managing speed does not come naturally .
`` Most of us grew up believing in the axioms ` Haste makes waste ' and ` Do n't cut corners , ' ideas that seem to run counter to the concept of managing speed , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Cassell</ENAMEX> , vice president for product integrity at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grumman Corp</ENAMEX> .
`` But in the real world , you learn that speed and quality are not a trade - off .
Speed is a component of quality -- one of the things we must deliver to satisfy customers . ''
Companies that actually market speed as part of their service train their managers to lead and participate in teams that increase speed and improve quality in everyday operations .
Managers learn to spot opportunities to increase customer satisfaction through speed , and shift some responsibility for analyzing , improving and streamlining work processes from themselves to teams of employees .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> team at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Express Ground Operations</ENAMEX> station in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Natick</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , focused on a particularly time - sensitive operation : the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> package sort .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Every morning</ENAMEX> , tractor - trailer trucks arrive at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Natick Ground Station</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Logan Airport</ENAMEX> , carrying the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> 's package load .
In peak periods that load may include <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</ENAMEX> pieces .
The packages must be sorted quickly and distributed to smaller vans for delivery , so couriers can be on the road by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL" E_OFF="3">8:35</ENAMEX> .
No customer is present at the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> package sort , but the process is nevertheless critical to customer satisfaction .
`` We 're committed to deliver the customer 's package by a stated time , usually <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10:30</ENAMEX> , '' notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Mortimer</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Express</ENAMEX> courier who led the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Natick</ENAMEX> team .
`` The sooner our vans hit the road <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">each morning</ENAMEX> , the easier it is for us to fulfill that obligation . ''
Following a problem - solving formula used by teams throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Express</ENAMEX> , members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Natick</ENAMEX> team monitored their <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> routine , carefully noting where and when the work group 's resources were used effectively and where they were idle , waiting for others upstream in the process to send packages their way .
`` We suspected there was downtime built into our process .
But we did n't know just where it was until we completed our data gathering , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mortimer</ENAMEX> says .
`` We used the data to redesign our sorting system and put our resources where they could do the most good . ''
The team even created a points system to identify those couriers and subgroups that were doing the most to reduce package - sort cycle time .
Winners of the friendly competition earn a steak dinner out with their spouses .
`` Monitoring shows that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Natick</ENAMEX> team 's new system really does reduce cycle time for the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> package sort , '' reports <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Barksdale</ENAMEX> , chief operating officer at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Express</ENAMEX> .
`` The vans leave <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">at least 15 minutes earlier</ENAMEX> , on average , than they used to .
And service levels have increased to the point where they 're consistently <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above 99 %</ENAMEX> . ''
A cross-functional team at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Union Carbide 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tonawanda</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , facility , which produces air - separation plants , followed a similar path to reduce manufacturing cycle time .
`` The team included craftsmen from the shop floor as well as engineering , scheduling and purchasing personnel , '' reports <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Westendorf</ENAMEX> , director of quality .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , they produced a flowchart detailing the process by which an air - separation plant actually gets built .
Then they identified snags in the process . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tonawanda</ENAMEX> team determined that holdups for inspections were the main problem and identified which kinds of delays involved critical inspections and which were less critical or could be handled by workers already on the line .
The team then proposed modifications in their work process to management .
`` The streamlined manufacturing process benefits our customers in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</ENAMEX> ways , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Westendorf</ENAMEX> concludes .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , we have better quality assurance than ever , because the people building the product have taken on more responsibility for the quality of their own work .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</ENAMEX> , we trimmed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a month</ENAMEX> off the time required to deliver a finished product . ''
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grumman 's Aircraft Systems Division</ENAMEX> , a cross-functional team reduced the cycle time required to produce a new business proposal for an important government contract .
The team was composed of representatives from engineering , manufacturing , corporate estimating , flight test , material , quality control , and other departments .
`` We needed contributions from all these departments to generate the proposal , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Anton</ENAMEX> , configuration - data manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grumman</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A - 6</ENAMEX> combat aircraft program .
`` But instead of gathering their input piecemeal , we formed the team , which reached consensus on the proposal objectives and produced a statement of work to guide all the functions that were involved . ''
Armed with this shared understanding and requisite background information , each department developed its specialized contribution to the proposal , submitting data and cost estimates on a closely managed schedule .
`` We cleared up questions and inconsistencies very quickly , because the people who had the skills and perspective required to resolve them were part of the task team , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anton</ENAMEX> explains .
The team trimmed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than two months</ENAMEX> from the cycle time previously required to develop comparable proposals .
`` The team eliminated the crisis mentality that proposal deadlines can generate .
The result was a more thoughtful , complete and competitive proposal , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anton</ENAMEX> concludes .
The successes achieved at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Express</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Union Carbide</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grumman</ENAMEX> suggest that managing speed may be an underutilized source of competitive advantage .
Managers in all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> companies recognize speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction .
They effectively lead team efforts to reduce cycle time .
And they prepare all their people to increase the speed and improve the quality of their own work .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Labovitz</ENAMEX> is president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ODI</ENAMEX> , a consulting firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burlington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX> .
