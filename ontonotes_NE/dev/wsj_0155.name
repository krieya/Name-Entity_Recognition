World sugar futures prices soared on rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> , a major grower and exporter , might not ship sugar <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this crop year</ENAMEX> and next .
Prices also were boosted by another rumor that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , usually a large producer and exporter , might have to buy a large quantity of sugar .
Although traders rushed to buy futures contracts , many remained skeptical about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Brazilian</ENAMEX> development , which could n't be confirmed , analysts said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May</ENAMEX> contracts rose to fresh life - of - contract highs of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.54 cents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.28 cents</ENAMEX> at their best levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March</ENAMEX> delivery , which has no limits , settled at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.53 cents</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.56 cent</ENAMEX> a pound .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May</ENAMEX> contract , which also is without restraints , ended with a gain of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.54 cent</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.26 cents</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> delivery rose its daily permissible limit of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.50 cent</ENAMEX> a pound to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.00 cents</ENAMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">other contract months</ENAMEX> showed near - limit advances .
According to reports carried by various news services , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Brazilian</ENAMEX> government told its sugar producers that they wo n't be allowed to export sugar during the current <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989 - 90</ENAMEX> season , which began <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990 - 91</ENAMEX> season so that it can be used to produce alcohol for automobile fuel .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> analyst , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Stevenson</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential - Bache Securities</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , estimated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</ENAMEX> or more of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> 's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and ca n't use gasoline .
`` This is a demand that must be met , regardless of the price of oil , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevenson</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> - largest producer and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</ENAMEX> - largest exporter of sugar in the world .
A shift to producing more alcohol and less sugar had been expected , but the latest news , if true , indicates a more drastic shift than had been anticipated .
During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the current crop year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> was expected to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.9 million tons</ENAMEX> of sugar , a drop from <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8.1 million tons</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988 - 89</ENAMEX> .
Its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989 - 90</ENAMEX> exports were expected to total <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">645,000 tons</ENAMEX> in contrast to shipments of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5 million tons</ENAMEX> in
`` It is <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">these 645,000 tons</ENAMEX> that are in question for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this crop year</ENAMEX> , '' explained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith Ganes</ENAMEX> , analyst for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
`` Producers were granted the right <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued '' <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
As a result , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ganes</ENAMEX> said , it is believed that little or no sugar from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989 - 90</ENAMEX> crop has been shipped yet , even though <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the crop year</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six months old</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than a half</ENAMEX> of all sugar produced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> goes for alcohol production , according to Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ganes</ENAMEX> .
Also , there has been a switch in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</ENAMEX> to planting of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane , and this change is being felt now , she said .
Most important , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ganes</ENAMEX> noted , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Brazilian</ENAMEX> officials said that no decision has as yet been made on the suspension of exports . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Oxnard</ENAMEX> , sugar analyst for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hackensack</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , said : `` I am highly skeptical that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> will curtail sugar exports , particularly with the price of sugar at over <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">14 cents</ENAMEX> a pound . ''
Above all , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oxnard</ENAMEX> noted , the situation is extremely confused .
`` Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Brazilian</ENAMEX> sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation , '' he said .
`` It 's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out , such as the one saying exports will be suspended , and no one can confirm it . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oxnard</ENAMEX> observed that the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> is also very complicated .
On the one hand , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> started an ethanol program <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about 15 years ago</ENAMEX> to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program .
`` It has to weigh , on the other hand , the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oxnard</ENAMEX> said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , which is normally a sugar exporter , has had production problems in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</ENAMEX> , analysts said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments , they noted .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</ENAMEX> it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 200,000 tons</ENAMEX> of sugar to meet internal needs , analysts said .
In other commodity markets <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> :
ENERGY :
Petroleum futures were generally higher with heating oil leading the way .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> , heating oil for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> delivery increased <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.25 cents</ENAMEX> to settle at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">60.36 cents</ENAMEX> a gallon .
Gasoline futures were mixed to unchanged .
But the strength in heating oil helped push up crude oil .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">West Texas Intermediate</ENAMEX> crude for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> delivery rose <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">13 cents</ENAMEX> a barrel to settle at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">20.07</ENAMEX> .
The firmness in heating oil was attributed to colder weather in parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and to the latest <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> report by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the American Petroleum Institute</ENAMEX> , which showed a decline in inventories of the fuel .
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS :
Prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices to come .
Trading was muted in part because of the observance of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">All Saints ' Day</ENAMEX> across much of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> .
Continued export demand also supported prices .
As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , market analysts said that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Tuesday</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> government , which often buys <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> grains in quantity , turned instead to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500,000 metric tons</ENAMEX> of wheat .
Traders said prices also were supported by widespread rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
That designation would , among other things , provide more generous credit terms under which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> could purchase grain .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> are widely believed to need additional supplies , despite running up record <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one - month</ENAMEX> purchases of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">310 million bushels</ENAMEX> of corn in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> .
COPPER :
Futures prices rose , extending <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> 's gains .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> contract advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.50 cents</ENAMEX> a pound to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.1650</ENAMEX> .
Buying for the most part carried over from the previous session , and traders apparently ignored reports that a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chilean</ENAMEX> mine strike may have ended almost before it began , an analyst said .
According to news service reports , most workers at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disputado</ENAMEX> mines owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX> agreed to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> wage contract that includes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> increase and other benefits .
However , some workers have n't yet accepted the new contract and are continuing negotiations , the analyst said .
Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Reuter</ENAMEX> reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papua - New Guinea</ENAMEX> government urged its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parliament</ENAMEX> to extend a state of emergency in copper - rich <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bougainville Island</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bougainville</ENAMEX> copper mine has been inoperative since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May 15</ENAMEX> because of attacks by native landowners who want <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bougainville</ENAMEX> to secede from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papua - New Guinea</ENAMEX> .
