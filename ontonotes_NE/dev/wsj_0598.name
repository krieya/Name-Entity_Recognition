<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> critics used to complain of `` stop and go '' monetary policies .
They claimed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> would <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt .
But under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> that has changed .
A supremely cautious man , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> chairman is forever blinking yellow .
Indeed , his caution has become legendary within the government .
He fusses endlessly over economic statistics , dissecting them in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</ENAMEX> of ways , probing for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</ENAMEX> in search of potential problems .
After thoroughly digesting reams of information , he often concludes that more data are needed , and when he finally decides to act , his movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small .
Such caution was evident after the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday - the - 13th</ENAMEX> stock market plunge .
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration officials urged Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets .
But he refused , claiming that he wanted to see what happened <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> before making any public statement .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> 's decision to keep quiet also prompted a near - mutiny within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> 's ranks .
A `` senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> official '' spoke on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> after the market swoon to both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Washington Post</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Times</ENAMEX> , saying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed .
The statement angered Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> , but it was greeted with applause by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration and the financial markets .
And , while the mutinous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> member has n't gone public , some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> governors , most notably Vice Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Johnson</ENAMEX> , are known to have disagreed with the chairman 's decision to remain silent .
Ironically , the anonymous official 's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> , who is mistakenly seen as the source .
At a hearing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Dodd</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> that `` Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> 's '' announcement over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the Oct. 13 weekend</ENAMEX> was a `` very important statement . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> hesitantly replied that he was n't sure whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> `` made a statement himself , or whether that was a newspaper report . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> chairman 's caution was apparent again on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> after the market 's plunge , when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets .
A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system .
And , by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of that week</ENAMEX> , the key federal funds interest rate , which is largely controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> , had settled at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.75 %</ENAMEX> , barely changed from the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just under 9 %</ENAMEX> that prevailed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous week</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration officials appear increasingly concerned that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> is cautious to a fault .
Signs of growing weakness in the economy , paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control , have caused them to wonder why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> chairman is so grudging in reducing rates .
Those concerns are n't expressed in public .
In fact , the administration and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> have been going out of their way in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two weeks</ENAMEX> to dispel any impression that they are at odds , fearing stories about an administration - Fed split added to the stock market 's jitters .
Still , the split is there .
The administration 's concerns are understandable .
The economy is showing signs of weakness , particularly among manufacturers .
Exports , which played a key role in fueling growth over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two years</ENAMEX> , seem to have stalled .
Factory payrolls and production fell in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> remains reluctant to loosen policy , partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> banks who oppose credit easing .
In addition , the chairman has a wary eye aimed a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> down the road .
Inflation may be stable at the moment , running at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 4.5 %</ENAMEX> .
But if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> eases too soon , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> fears , prices may begin to accelerate again <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
Moreover , if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> holds tight , it may be able gradually to reduce inflation , moving toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</ENAMEX> - inflation goal that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> chairman embraced in testimony to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> .
So far , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> 's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well .
His hand on the monetary tiller seems <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> reason why the economy <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</ENAMEX> seems highly likely to begin <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">an unprecedented eighth year</ENAMEX> of peacetime growth without a recession .
`` We 've gotten through <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> stock market crashes , and we 've gone through an election without any major problems , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hale</ENAMEX> , an economist of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kemper Financial Services</ENAMEX> .
`` I think you have to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> a good rating . ''
But such caution is no guarantee against mistakes .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> 's reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession , perhaps starting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early next year</ENAMEX> .
If that happens , Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> could well become an open target .
Already , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> is toying with legislation to curb the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> 's independence .
If the economy turns down , such proposals could gain strong momentum .
