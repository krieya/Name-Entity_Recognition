The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> in their early history did not designate a day to lay work aside .
This is why some scholars considered taking <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> off a kind of imitation of the unbelievers , because they are accustomed to leaving work on their weekly holiday , like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jews</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christians</ENAMEX> .
It has become common in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> world to take off from official and semi-official work , such as in companies , on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
The excuse for taking off on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> was that one would be free for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> prayers .
That is why it has become an acceptable custom , and this distances it from the comparison that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> holiday .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> guided this community to this day and led it away from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jews</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christians</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jews</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christians</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> .
But when the imitation sickness intensified in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> community , their ways of taking on the attitudes of unbelieving people diversified .
Some of them made the weekend <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> , like <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christian</ENAMEX> countries .
This is the ugliest type of imitation in this matter .
And some of them made the weekend <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> .
I do not think anyone made the weekend three days .
And some of them were satisfied to imitate the number of days of the weekend , so they made the week 's holiday on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
This is the lesser evil among them .
There are many evils in long holidays ; this is not the place for detailing them , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> knows better .
Peace be upon our Prophet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed</ENAMEX> , his family , and companions .
