Small businesses say a recent trend is like a dream come true : more - affordable rates for employee - health insurance , initially at least .
But then they wake up to a nightmare .
The reasonable <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">first - year</ENAMEX> rates can be followed by increases of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> or more if a covered employee files a major claim , they complain .
Insurance premiums for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> concern went up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">130 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">less than two years</ENAMEX> , the last increase coming after <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> workers developed a herniated disk .
`` There 's a distinct possibility that I may lose my job over this , '' the employee , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Allen</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Floor Covering Resources</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kensington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Md.</ENAMEX> , recently told a congressional hearing .
She said her employer ca n't afford the rate increases , and she fears she wo n't find another job with a benefit plan covering her ailment .
For employee and employer alike , the worry is widespread .
Surveys repeatedly show that small - business owners rank the availability and rising cost of health insurance as one of their biggest concerns .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The House Energy and Commerce Committee 's</ENAMEX> health subcommittee , headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Waxman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , is looking into complaints that small businesses not only ca n't keep reasonably priced employee - health insurance if claims are filed , but often ca n't get coverage at all if a worker is termed medically uninsurable .
`` I have an old - fashioned name for people in that position : sick people who need health insurance , '' Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waxman</ENAMEX> says . ``
What we 're seeing now makes a mockery of the idea of insurance : collect premiums from the healthy , dump the sick and let them pay their own bills . ''
Some lawmakers may seek legislation to limit overly restrictive insurance policies .
The concern grows out of increased efforts by the insurers to woo the small - business market .
As larger companies increasingly self - insure , or use reserves to pay their own workers ' medical bills , the insurance industry has turned to the small - employer market that was once a backwater for them .
`` Insurance companies will offer a good rate if no one is sick , but it 's a roll of the dice , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosemary Heinhold</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Small Business Service Bureau</ENAMEX> , a group representing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35,000</ENAMEX> small businesses nationwide .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> case of cancer or a high - risk pregnancy with a sick infant , and rates go up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 % to 60 %</ENAMEX> .
Small - business people end up paying insurance premiums worth <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to three</ENAMEX> times the cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> illness . ''
In addition , the group says some of its member companies have been denied insurance because individual workers had medical problems that ranged from a mild cardiac condition to psychological counseling after a divorce , hemorrhoids and overweight .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Health Insurance Association of America</ENAMEX> , an insurers ' trade group , acknowledges that stiff competition among its members to insure businesses likely to be good risks during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</ENAMEX> of coverage has aggravated the problem in the small - business market .
But it says that rapid rate increases are directly tied to the soaring cost of health care .
Some business analysts blame the problem on tough competition in the insurance market .
They say insurance companies use policies aimed at excluding bad risks because their competitors do .
But the general practice makes it more difficult to combine small groups of people into larger groups , thus spreading the risk over a larger base of premiums .
`` I 'm not accusing insurers of dereliction of duty , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Patricelli</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waxman</ENAMEX> 's panel .
`` You ca n't ask <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> carrier to underwrite on social grounds when that might destroy it in the marketplace . ''
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waxman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kennedy</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> have proposed regulation to deal with the problem .
The proposal is just part of legislation that would require businesses to provide health benefits , an idea that is strongly opposed by small business who say it would just compound the insurance - cost problems .
But small - business lobbyists say they support the idea , included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Kennedy - Waxman</ENAMEX> bill , of new laws or regulations requiring greater use of community rating , which pegs rates to the use of health care by a community or other large group , and is designed to prevent insurance companies from taking only low - risk small companies as clients .
But first on the list of priorities , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Federation of Independent Business</ENAMEX> , is to prohibit state laws requiring the inclusion of specialty items , such as psychiatric care , in basic health plans .
Such requirements , they argue , make it difficult to provide a basic , low - cost health - benefits package .
`` Before the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> mandated that mental - health care be covered , there were <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 70</ENAMEX> mental - health clinics in the state ; now there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carolyn Miller</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NFIB</ENAMEX> lobbyist .
She contends that similar mandates have driven up insurance costs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> .
The insurance - industry association also strongly disagrees with the proposed community rating , which `` does n't save <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">one dollar</ENAMEX> , '' argues <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Dorsch</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">HIAA</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> counsel .
`` It just makes healthy businesses subsidize unhealthy ones and gives each employer less incentive to keep his workers healthy . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorsch</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">HIAA</ENAMEX> is working on a proposal to establish a privately funded reinsurance mechanism to help cover small groups that ca n't get insurance without excluding certain employees .
The complexities of the insurance problem make the outcome difficult to predict .
But to Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> , the employee whose back problem triggered a huge insurance - rate increase , the issue was simple .
`` What good is having health insurance , '' she asked , `` when it 's so expensive that it becomes impossible to keep after <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</ENAMEX> major claim ?
