A shift of winds is pushing an oil spill away from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Galapagos Islands</ENAMEX> and into the open sea , but the cleanup is far from over , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Moore</ENAMEX> reports .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ecuador</ENAMEX> 's declaration of a state of emergencies around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Galapagos Islands</ENAMEX> is a sign of how serious the oil spil is now judged .
It may not be a large tanker by international standards , but this is a uniquely fragile and precious marine environment .
Experts examining the wreck are still concentrating on transferring to safe storage the oil and fuel that remains on board , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Coast Guard</ENAMEX> are helping in this operation , but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ecuador</ENAMEX> 's Environment Minister describes the ship 's condition as critical with <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gallons</ENAMEX> of oil still on the ship .
Some of that fuel will evaporate but the currents are moving the spill toward a large number of other islands in the chain .
