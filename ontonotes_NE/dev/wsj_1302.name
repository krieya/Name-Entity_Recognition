At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's of London</ENAMEX> , underwriters still scratch out policies using fountain pens and blotting paper .
Visitors are ushered into the premises by red - frocked doormen known as waiters , a reminder of the insurance market 's origins in a coffeehouse in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">17th century</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> .
Such trappings suggest a glorious past but give no hint of a troubled present .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> , once a pillar of the world insurance market , is being shaken to its very foundation .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">301 - year - old</ENAMEX> exchange is battered by enormous claims from a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</ENAMEX> - long run of unprecedented disasters , the most recent of which is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week 's</ENAMEX> earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Bay Area</ENAMEX> .
At the same time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> is besieged by disgruntled investors and hamstrung by inefficient but time - honored ways of conducting business .
The exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow , less - profitable segments of the market by less hidebound competitors .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> is on the ropes , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Nutting</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> investor for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">17 years</ENAMEX> who now leads a dissident group threatening to sue exchange underwriters for alleged mismanagement and negligence .
`` It needs more discipline .
It needs to sort itself out . ''
Most troublesome is the shrinking pool of `` names , '' the well - heeled investors -LRB- some of them royal -RRB- who , as members of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 360</ENAMEX> syndicates , underwrite policies .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 1,750</ENAMEX> members quit the exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , more than triple the number of resignations in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> .
Names are resigning at an even faster pace <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
Lackluster returns are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> reason .
The average after - tax return on investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the most recent year</ENAMEX> for which results are available , was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5 %</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chatset Ltd.</ENAMEX> , an insurance consulting firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> , it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.1 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1981 and 1986</ENAMEX> , the most recent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year</ENAMEX> period for which figures are available , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> reported over <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 3.6 billion</ENAMEX> in claims and reserves against future losses -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.7 billion</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's exchange rates -RRB- , more than double the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 1.35 billion</ENAMEX> posted in the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year</ENAMEX> period .
Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31,329</ENAMEX> investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange 's most basic tenets , the concept of unlimited personal liability .
Investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims , but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe .
And catastrophes are getting ever more costly .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> claims for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Piper Alpha</ENAMEX> oil - rig disaster in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the North Sea</ENAMEX> , for instance , may reach <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> .
During the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year</ENAMEX> period ended <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly 80 %</ENAMEX> of the names had money tied up in money - losing syndicates , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chatset</ENAMEX> consultants .
The peril of unlimited liability looms large for a number of them now .
`` I have wished I could die and be out of it -- that 's how bad it is , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Atkins</ENAMEX> , a secretary from suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> , says .
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atkins</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> membership was a bonus from a former employer in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> , belongs to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nutting</ENAMEX> 's dissident group on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Outhwaite</ENAMEX> syndicate , which has been hard hit by asbestos reinsurance claims .
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atkins</ENAMEX> , who underwrote # <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">20,000</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 32,000</ENAMEX> , of insurance coverage on that syndicate , now faces potential losses of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly # 70,000</ENAMEX> , or $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">111,000</ENAMEX> .
`` If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> wants # <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">70,000</ENAMEX> out of me they will have to take everything I 've got -- and even then I do n't know if it will be enough , '' she says .
Unease is widespread among exchange members .
`` I ca n't think of any reason to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> now , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith Whitten</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> businessman and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd</ENAMEX> 's member since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</ENAMEX> .
`` The downside is very considerable , and at the moment the upside is very marginal . ''
If profits do n't improve , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitten</ENAMEX> says he may quit the exchange .
Meanwhile , competition from rivals unencumbered by history is intensifying .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> is being squeezed out of low - margin but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</ENAMEX> , competitors have chipped away at the exchange 's share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 2.5 billion</ENAMEX> marine market in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> the world 's ships are insured .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66 %</ENAMEX> stake in that market has shrunk to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> in that period , according to an official at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Institute of London Underwriters</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> competitor .
-LRB- The official asked not to be named . -RRB-
Much of the business has gone to the institute , an association of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</ENAMEX> insurers , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cigna Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Allianz Versicherungs AG</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Commercial Union Assurance PLC</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> has endured <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</ENAMEX> of genteel decline .
At the peak of its power and influence <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a century ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> dominated the insurance world with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> stake .
It virtually dictated how ships were to be built and it monitored commerce through a unrivaled intelligence network in ports around the globe .
Today , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> share of the world market , excluding life insurance , is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2 %</ENAMEX> .
-LRB- Its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included . -RRB-
Bigger rivals , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Aetna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Allianz</ENAMEX> , backed by armies of statisticians using computers in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of branches , operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates , brokers say .
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> pioneered such now - standard policies as worker 's compensation insurance , burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses , and bankers ' liability insurance , competitors now underwrite most of that business .
Beyond that , many big oil , chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through `` captive '' offshore companies for industry - specific coverage .
Even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> specialty -- unusually risky ventures -- is being challenged .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Only 10 years ago</ENAMEX> , for instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> was the pre-eminent insurer of thoroughbred horses .
But since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kirk Horse Insurance Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lexington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ky.</ENAMEX> has grabbed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</ENAMEX> stake of the market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Kirk</ENAMEX> , president , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> has suffered because its structure does n't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients ; brokers are required intermediaries .
Thus , he asserts , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> ca n't react quickly to competition .
`` Lloyd 's has lost control of the situation , '' he says .
`` They are n't controlling their destiny like they used to . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray Lawrence</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> chairman , agrees the exchange faces big challenges .
`` This is a watershed time , and we are trying to plot our way ahead , '' he says .
`` We have been a great market for inventing risks which other people then take , copy and cut rates . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> , he says , is cut off from `` the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which acts as a steadying influence '' against catastrophic losses .
By that , he means low - margin but low - risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance .
The exchange , he says , must find new products and new markets .
That wo n't be an easy task .
Tradition is dictator at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Three years ago</ENAMEX> , the exchange took up residence in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">space - age</ENAMEX> tower of steel and glass -- evocative of the kind of modern architecture that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> has denounced .
-LRB- Some exchange wags call the building `` the oil rig . '' -RRB-
But along with such treasured artifacts as Lord <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson</ENAMEX> 's spyglass , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> also brought its outmoded ways of doing business .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> market actively underwrites insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">just 4 1/2 hours</ENAMEX> a day , brokers say .
Underwriting does n't get under way until after <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> tea at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10 a.m</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">two - hour</ENAMEX> lunch break follows .
Things wind down at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">about 4:30 p.m.</ENAMEX> , just in time for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</ENAMEX> tea .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> vast trading hall houses a warren of well - polished desks .
The hall 's few computers are used mostly to send messages .
Sandwiched between desks , underwriters sit on benches surrounded by stacks of policies .
Brokers clutching thick folders stand in lines , waiting their turn to speak to the underwriters .
A broker may have to approach <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 20</ENAMEX> underwriters who insure the endeavors on behalf of the syndicates .
It could take <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</ENAMEX> for a claim to be paid .
`` The system , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Samengo - Turner</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd</ENAMEX> 's broker who left the exchange in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> , `` is so ludicrously unprofessional it drives you mad . ''
Some maintain underwriters also have been inept .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Wetherell</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd</ENAMEX> 's underwriter , says he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 50 %</ENAMEX> the premiums they should have charged for property risks <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1980 to 1985</ENAMEX> .
`` How unprofessional we must have appeared to the outside world -- how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation , '' he says .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> officials decline to comment on the matter .
More recently , property rates have increased .
Many at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further .
But it will be <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters .
The magnitude of the exchange 's problems may not become known for some time because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> practice of leaving the books open for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> to allow for the settlement of claims .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> only recently reported its financial results for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">That year</ENAMEX> , it posted record pretax profit of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 650 million</ENAMEX> , a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> says reported profit will be down in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> , though he declines to specify how steep the decline will be .
Insurance analysts say the exchange 's downturn in profitability is likely to be aggravated by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 600 million</ENAMEX> in aviation losses -LRB- including the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pan Am</ENAMEX> airline disaster over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> -RRB- and a still - uncalculated chunk of claims from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> says the departures of names is n't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity , currently <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about # 11 billion</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> says the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names .
Meanwhile , the exchange has been trying to lower costs .
-LRB- It recently cut its work force by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">213</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> is hampered in its efforts to overhaul operations by its reluctance to embrace modern technology .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wetherell</ENAMEX> , the underwriter , reckons <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> of his business could be transacted by computer , cutting costs at least <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> .
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> has talked for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> about computerizing underwriting transactions , the effort has n't gotten very far .
Competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to centralize price and policy information .
Both groups cling to traditional face - to - face dealings , even for routine policies .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> overblown bureaucracy also hampers efforts to update marketing strategies .
Some underwriters have been pressing for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> to tap the low - margin business by selling some policies directly to consumers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public , and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> .
But such changes must be cleared by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> internal committees and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</ENAMEX> of underwriters , brokers and administrators before being implemented .
The proposal to sell directly to the public remains mired in bureaucratic quicksand .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> is moving forward on some fronts , though .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> says the exchange is updating some procedures to make speedier payments on claims .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> , all underwriters will be linked to a communications network that could reduce paper work on claims .
