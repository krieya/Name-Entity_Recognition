But %uh , yeah ,
it 's still , it 's still fairly e- , -e , it 's still a fairly expensive call
but %uh but it 's a lot less expensive if we do it that way than if we , than if we actually make my , my , my parents in law pay it ,
then it
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Dutch</ENAMEX> have such high taxes on those
they consider it a luxury to call around the world
so they tax it really high .
Anyway %um
So you guys will be in either <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighteenth</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the nineteenth</ENAMEX>
and you 're going to go to %uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> .
Well I would say is once you 're at a hotel uh-huh %um , why do n't you call me at work and let me know where you are ,
and then a- , we can make arrangements that day %um , that I can meet you in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> .
And maybe I 'll come by m- , public transport .
It 's s- , probably easier for me to come by public transport in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> than it is for me to come by car to be honest .
mhm .
The streets are small
and there 's no parking .
So I probably will come by public transport
but I do n't know .
We 'll see where you 're staying
%um
and there 's a lot more for you guys if you want to see stuff
you can see stuff in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>
and %uh since the days are really long ,
I mean it stays light here till about <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">ten thirty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">eleven o'clock</ENAMEX> mhm . <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">at night</ENAMEX> .
So if you want we can , we can take a ride and go see stuff <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">at night</ENAMEX>
and I can take you to some places ,
we can go see %uh go see some stuff .
%um , depends on what you guys want to see .
So you guys should pick out the things you want to see and let me know .
okay
%um and I 'll , I 'll sit and talk with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anya</ENAMEX> about some things that maybe we think that it would be neat for you to see .
So if you do n't have any ideas we 'll just put something together for you .
okay .
%um but yeah
but I can pick you up th- ,
you know I 'll probably be there some time <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">around six</ENAMEX>
and we can like do , do a quick dinner or something and then go %uh and then go yeah and go see whatever you want to see ,
if you want to stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> that 's fine .
If you want to go %uh off into the countryside somewhere and see a little bit of , e- echte <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holland</ENAMEX> , real <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holland</ENAMEX> and we can do that too .
Actually I 've , I 've been up to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holland</ENAMEX> before .
Spent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about two weeks</ENAMEX> up there .
yeah .
So %um ,
but that was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years and years ago</ENAMEX> .
With your parents when your father was stationed over here , right ?
yeah .
But we , we got to see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Den Haag</ENAMEX> and places like that too which we 're obviously not going to see this time .
But %um
Has , has <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> been here before ?
And , an-
No .
oh good .
But then again I 'm , I 'm not sure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> would be interested in seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shape Headquarters</ENAMEX> and you know all that kind of stuff . those military things .
Would you be interested in seeing , s- seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shape Headquarters</ENAMEX> again .
No . Not really .
yeah .
I di- , I did n't think so .
Somehow I had this feeling that th- , th- , the military taste had been beaten out of you .
yep .
I 'm ,
the mil- ,
I ca n't say too bad things about the military though .
They still have my goods
and they 'll probably hold them hostage .
And they own my body and soul for like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">another four years</ENAMEX>
so I just got to pray that they
oh do they ?
yeah .
I ha- , I owe <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> in active reserve time .
aw great .
Do they do that to everyone ?
Milo , get out of there
yeah everyone who -- -- %eh everyone who 's %uh who has n't been like you were
you went through like the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thirty six</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> process .
mhm .
So you do n't ha- , you do n't have it
but if yeah if you just separate normally and you have n't served <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at least eight years</ENAMEX> , then you owe it .
And that 's one of those things they just never tell you up front .
No .
They never said anything
I me- . I figured there was something like that because
And I was , I was in the inactive reserves the entire time I was in college too .
So .
yeah .
Th- , that 's I mean that 's the military .
I , I have my , my discharge papers and everything
uh-huh .
and I 've , they , I 've , I 've said that yeah I will give a urine sample or a blood sample if they w- , if they call me back for those , but they 're going to have to pay my trip back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the states</ENAMEX> . because there 's no bases in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holland</ENAMEX> and I 'm not going to pay out of my own expenses to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> or something for them .
If they want me they can pay ,
bring me back active duty and pay me for the day if they 're going to drag me off somewhere .
But %uh , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> they have to find me .
yeah , that 's the other
it was i- ,
if you 're in another country I mean and you 're not planning on coming back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the U S</ENAMEX> what do y- , what are they going to do even if you do n't .
yeah .
Well I mean I 'm still <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> citizen
and I still would like to be welcome in my own country .
Although g-
%uh I mean if , if , if they denied my citizenship and I became a citizen here I probably would n't h- , be a horror either ,
but %uh yeah
right now I 'm , I mean I do want to keep my <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> citizenship
so .
u- I kind of want to
Are you going to become a dual citizen ?
What 's that ?
Are you going to try and become a dual citizen ?
Have dual citizenship ?
You ca n't do You ca n't do that ,
%um , the only way to be a dual citizen is if you 're born in a foreign country
like if I were born in , in , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holland</ENAMEX> and then when , and then had <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> parents . Then I could be a dual citizen .
But you ca n't
If I would to ask to become a citizen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holland</ENAMEX> I would automatically lose my <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> citizenship .
As far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> are concerned , yeah .
yeah .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Dutch</ENAMEX> could care less .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Dutch</ENAMEX> would say fine
want to be a dual citizen ,
that 's fine ,
but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> as soon as you ask for another citizenship that act of asking for it t- , takes away your <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> citizenship .
I mean it 's kind of stupid .
yeah .
So I 'm a- , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> ri- , I 'm a , I 'm an expatriot .
An <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> expatriot .
An <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> living abroad .
I still have to file a tax return .
Do you ?
yeah .
But my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">seventy five thousand dollars</ENAMEX> worth of income is tax free .
Good grief .
As long as I do n't bring it back to the states .
Good grief .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">I R S</ENAMEX> for you , %huh ?
yeah .
oh they want their share .
They want their piece of meat .
But u- , u- , all foreign taxes are deductible ,
and my taxes here are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fifty percent</ENAMEX> of income .
So the taxes here are so much higher that , yeah I would never have to worry about it .
Unless you became C E O of the company then , then maybe like <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a thousand dollars</ENAMEX> would be taxable , right ?
yeah .
Somehow it raises a small amount .
The problem 's going to be , the problem 's going to be %uh be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anya</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> salary is taxable here and at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fifty percent</ENAMEX>
so we 're going to owe some money to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Dutch government</ENAMEX> on her salary .
aw .
Some amount that has , that has to be deducted a certain amount
and the amount we pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the American government</ENAMEX> is deductible ,
but j- , we 'll still owe some taxes .
Th- ,
see I do n't know how it works .
We 're going to need to have some , we 're going to be in need of some sort of accountant do it cause I have no clue how that all works .
They do n't have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Quicken</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Dutch</ENAMEX> version ?
yeah .
%ah , you know I would n't trust it because it 's so complicated with this international garbage Or , or else <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the Turbo Tax</ENAMEX> with the , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Dutch</ENAMEX> modules . that I 'd yeah . I , somehow I just would n't trust it .
I do n't know , %eh .
yeah .
So complicated when you 're dealing with a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Dutch</ENAMEX> tax form .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anya</ENAMEX> had to read it
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anya</ENAMEX> and her father did n't understand the damn thing .
How am I supposed to understand it ?
I 'm really looking forward to moving to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> and dealing with ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> you pay state tax
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> you do n't .
I 'm looking forward to that cause %uh
yeah
but you 'll be a s- You 'll be a student
so you ,
I mean you 're
what , what is your income ?
oh , well
See I think y- , %um ,
it 'll probably be <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about five thousand dollars</ENAMEX> for the , for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the portion of the next year</ENAMEX> that I 'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the portion of this year</ENAMEX> that I 'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>
and then <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> it 'll be <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven thousand</ENAMEX> .
yeah .
But you 'll be below y- , I mean you 're below the poverty line at that level .
yeah .
So I mean i- , i- , any income that y-
Well
But then I 've already made say <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">like fifteen thousand</ENAMEX> or whatever here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
but
That should be non taxable out of state income .
It should
but you know It , it just , it 's not going to be a fun tax return <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> .
I had that when I went into the military .
But then again .
I had Kans- ,
I had to file <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> taxes .
I had to file <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> and yeah and then my federal .
So .
Well , %um actually I think this phone call 's just about to end cause it 's only <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">half an hour</ENAMEX> ,
but %um
So let 's see .
I 'll , I 'll give you a call when we arrive in h- ,
or maybe I 'll just call you when we get in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holland</ENAMEX> just to let you know we 're there ,
so if we get in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighteenth</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the nineteenth</ENAMEX> and then call you back when %um when we get to a hotel or something like that .
okay that 's a that 's a great idea .
If you as soon as you get into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holland</ENAMEX> and get yourself settled you can call me
and %uh if I 'm if it 's at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> , just call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anya</ENAMEX> 's parents
okay so
and remember that if you dial in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holland</ENAMEX> you need to add a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</ENAMEX>
so like right now it 's okay it 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</ENAMEX> area code .
If you dial in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holland</ENAMEX> , it 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</ENAMEX> . okay in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holland</ENAMEX>
and and then yeah you can just call up
if if it 's if it 's during <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the work hours</ENAMEX> , fine , call me at work .
If not , call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anya</ENAMEX> 's parents if you do n't have a new phone number for me .
And if you do , I 'll send it by email okay if I get it <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">before th- this weekend</ENAMEX>
I 'll we 'll email you something
but if you do n't get email then just call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anya</ENAMEX> 's parents
If we have a phone by then , they 'll be able to give you the number
okay
and just remember to ask for her mother .
and it 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goode</ENAMEX> , right
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bode</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bode</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bode</ENAMEX> as in a- abode
abode
minus the A
okay
great
and
yeah
and I think %uh it 's %uh it 's not Frau
%uh %ah it 's %uh It 's Mifrau Mifrau
is the %uh is is is
it 's Frau in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">German</ENAMEX>
it 's Frau
mhm
and then <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Dutch</ENAMEX> it 's Mifrau
I 'll probably never remember that
so hope they wo n't be offended .
nah do n't worry about it .
You can just call her Missus
you can just call her Missus and speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> to her .
She 'll she understands
just talk slowly and clearly .
okay
and once you 're in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holland</ENAMEX> the line will be really clear .
I mean the phones here are pretty good . once you 're in the country .
It 's just these over over Amer- to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>
it 's always kind of iffy
