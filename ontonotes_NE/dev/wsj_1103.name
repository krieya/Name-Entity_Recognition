<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boston Co.</ENAMEX> , the upper - crust financial services concern that was rocked by a management scandal <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late last year</ENAMEX> , has had a sharp drop in profitability -- mainly because a high - risk bet on interest rates backfired .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boston Co. 's</ENAMEX> fall from grace is bad news for its parent , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX> , which has relied heavily on the banking and money management unit 's contributions in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boston Co.</ENAMEX> had an estimated pretax profit of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 110 million</ENAMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson</ENAMEX> managed net income of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">just $ 96 million</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson</ENAMEX> does n't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries .
But people familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boston Co. 's</ENAMEX> performance say the unit had profit of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 17 million</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third quarter</ENAMEX> , after barely breaking even for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first six months</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , posted net income of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 106 million</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first nine months of the year</ENAMEX> , down slightly from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 110 million</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year - ago</ENAMEX> period .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moody 's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> downgraded the long - term deposit rating of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boston Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boston Safe Deposit -AMP- Trust Co.</ENAMEX> subsidiary , to single - A - 1 from double - A - 3 , citing problems in the company 's `` aggressively managed securities portfolio . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kriz</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moody</ENAMEX> 's vice president , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boston Safe Deposit 's</ENAMEX> performance has been hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> by a mismatch in the maturities of its assets and liabilities .
The mismatch exposed the company to a high degree of interest - rate risk , and when rates moved unfavorably -- beginning <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late last year</ENAMEX> and continuing into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> -- `` it cost them , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kriz</ENAMEX> said .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kriz</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boston Safe Deposit</ENAMEX> `` has taken some actions to better control asset - liability management and improve controls in general , and we think these will serve to improve credit quality . ''
As some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested , the problems ought to ease , he said .
But he also cited concerns over the company 's mortgage exposure in the troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">New England</ENAMEX> real estate market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boston Co.</ENAMEX> officials declined to comment on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moody 's</ENAMEX> action or on the unit 's financial performance <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> -- except to deny a published report that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first three quarters '</ENAMEX> results .
An accounting controversy at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of last year</ENAMEX> forced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boston Co.</ENAMEX> to admit it had overstated pretax profits by some <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 44 million</ENAMEX> .
The resulting scandal led to the firing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James N. von Germeten</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boston Co. 's</ENAMEX> president and to the resignations of the company 's chief financial officer and treasurer .
The executives were accused of improperly deferring expenses and booking revenue early , in an effort to dress up results -- and perhaps bolster performance - related bonuses .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Germeten</ENAMEX> , in turn , attributed the controversy to judgmental errors by accountants and accused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson</ENAMEX> of conducting a `` witch hunt . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kriz</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moody 's</ENAMEX> said the problems in the securities portfolio stem largely from positions taken <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
The company 's current management found itself `` locked into this , '' he said .
