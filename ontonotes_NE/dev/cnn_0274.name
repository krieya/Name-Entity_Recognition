A live picture of the President of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> landing at an air field in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern Ireland</ENAMEX> .
Once he gets out of the helicopter he 'll transfer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Air Force One</ENAMEX> to come home after a <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">20 - hour</ENAMEX> visit with the Prime Minister of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Britain</ENAMEX> .
They talked about a lot of things , about what peace in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> could look like , what post-war <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> could look like .
They talked about problems in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern Ireland</ENAMEX> .
We 're going to pause for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a second</ENAMEX> to see if we see the President hopping off this chopper .
As you probably know , the Prime Minister of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Great Britain</ENAMEX> has been under great pressure at home and much of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> to support giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> a very strong role in stabilizing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The White House</ENAMEX> had signaled consistently it wants <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Britain</ENAMEX> to create a lead role .
We learned from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John King</ENAMEX> , traveling with the President , that the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> will be run neither by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> / <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> coalition or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Nations</ENAMEX> , but by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> people .
That some of what the Prime Minister and President shared with reporters at news conference following their meetings .
The President went on to say that an interim authority composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> GRS inside and outside the country will run <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> until a permanent government can be established .
Do you want to hang with the shot ?
Okay , we 're going to stay with this shot .
We 'll talk more about what the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> leaders discussed at the joint news conference following their series of meetings .
They really wanted to let folks who had any concerns about what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.N.</ENAMEX> involvement might be to not worry .
They said there will definitely be some kind of role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> .
They think it 's very important for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> nations to be on board with the plan , but once again , they very much view the future of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> as being that in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> hands .
The President greeting a number of dignitaries as he gets ready here to board <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Air Force One</ENAMEX> on his way home .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">A little earlier this morning</ENAMEX> , I spoke with an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> dissident who teaches and writes extensively on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> .
He wrote a book called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Republic of Fear , the Politics of Modern Iraq</ENAMEX> , and I asked him about the news that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> was targeted in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's strike and how <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> would react if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> was killed .
