Applause for `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sometimes , Talk Is the Best Medicine</ENAMEX> , '' in your <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 5</ENAMEX> Marketplace section .
Indeed , the `` art of doctoring '' does contribute to better health results and discourages unwarranted malpractice litigation .
Elaborating on the concern about doctors ' sacrificing earnings in order to spend `` talk time '' with patients , we are finding the quality of the time spent is the key to true rapport .
Even brief conversations can show caring and trust , and need not restrict the efficiency of the communication or restrain the doctor 's earnings .
The issue is far - reaching .
Right now , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> populace is spending <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 12 %</ENAMEX> of our gross national product on health care .
That amounts to more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 billion</ENAMEX> a year .
And it is estimated that more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</ENAMEX> of that , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70 billion</ENAMEX> , goes to `` defensive medicine '' -- those measures taken by doctors to protect themselves from the most unlikely possibilities .
So we all stand to benefit if patient - physician relations become a `` partnership . ''
