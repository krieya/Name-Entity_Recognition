This is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The World</ENAMEX> , I am <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Mullins</ENAMEX> .
Up next a global hip - hop beat laid down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and danced to in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West African</ENAMEX> nation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Senegal</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">World</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marco Warman</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's musical finale .
Imagine trying to translate the lyrics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Sugar Hill Gang 's</ENAMEX> notorious rap classic , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rapper 's Delight</ENAMEX> .
Fortunately for rap fans in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Senegalese</ENAMEX> capital , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dakar</ENAMEX> translating these tunes is n't necessary .
The city has its own homegrown hip - hop scene .
It is a hip - hop but <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">African</ENAMEX> hip - hop with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">African</ENAMEX> instruments , you know , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">African</ENAMEX> chant , traditional sounds .
That is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amidu Barry</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one half</ENAMEX> of the duo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Positive Black Soul</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PBS</ENAMEX> .
They are the doyens of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dakar</ENAMEX> 's hip - hop scene , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Sugar Hill Gang</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Senegal</ENAMEX> if you will .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Positive Black Soul</ENAMEX> sings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Senegal</ENAMEX> 's main language <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Wolof</ENAMEX> but if the music sounds like it comes straight out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronx</ENAMEX> , well , you are not far off .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PBS</ENAMEX> produce their albums in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
Lead singer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amidu Berry</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> producers make hip - hop in any language come out sounding right .
They know how to make a hip - hop record sound good .
They know the sound of hip - hop , you know , and they have got the equipment and the engineers and they know how to handle it .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Positive Black Soul 's</ENAMEX> music is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> and foremost <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Senegalese</ENAMEX> music .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> saxophonist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Murray</ENAMEX> recorded his acclaimed afrocentric jazz album , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fo Juke Review</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dakar</ENAMEX> , he recruited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amidu Berry</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DJ Awadi</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PBS</ENAMEX> to show what an edge <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West African</ENAMEX> music can really have .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Awadi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> performed , they managed simultaneously to bathe in the group of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> hip - hop and they keep a clear sense that they are from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Senegal</ENAMEX> .
This connection to national and musical identities results partly from the fact that many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Senegalese</ENAMEX> artists want to stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Senegal</ENAMEX> to live and work says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PBS</ENAMEX> singer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tidia Awadi</ENAMEX> .
It is because they know they have the inspiration in their country .
I think everybody want to stay in his country , want to die in his country .
If you can stay and make it happen , the place where you was born , where you grew up then try to make it there .
It 's possible .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Senegalese</ENAMEX> rappers are also identified by what they say in their tracks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> hip - hop lyrics often revolve around the accumulation of material wealth and throwing parties .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PBS</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Senegalese</ENAMEX> rap groups have different concerns .
In the grim lyrics to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Leboho Inwa</ENAMEX> , the executioner is black .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PBS</ENAMEX> raps that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Africans</ENAMEX> are their worst enemies .
Front man <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amidu Barry</ENAMEX> may look like he got his moves on the streets of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> but his critique of post-colonial finger pointing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> tells a different story .
You know , in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> every time you know something bad happens , everybody like you know is because of the white man , you know the colonization , the slavery .
They do n't realize that you know the real execution is really black 's black like them .
So before they say it is a white man tangle you know it 's because of a white man that this happens and they got to , you know , check around and they say who is the real guilty .
We got to accept it and try to , you know , change the things , make the things better .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Positive Black Soul</ENAMEX> are now the oldsters of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dakar</ENAMEX> 's hip - hop scene and they have established the template of social consciousness that many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Senegalese</ENAMEX> hip - hop groups follow like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bootin Bye</ENAMEX> , which recently scored this hit about AIDS prevention .
Again <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amidu Barry</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Postive Black Soul</ENAMEX> .
When we started there were maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> hip - hop groups in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dakar</ENAMEX> and now <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> we got <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2000</ENAMEX> groups only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dakar</ENAMEX> , let 's say in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Senegal</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two thousand</ENAMEX> hip - hop bands ?
Hip - hop bands only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dakar</ENAMEX> , not the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Senegal</ENAMEX> .
So you know it is amazing .
It 's fantastic , extraordinary .
Just how extraordinary can be heard on a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> recording .
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Hop</ENAMEX> is a compilation featuring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dakar</ENAMEX> 's biggest rap stars from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bidu Bubes</ENAMEX> to the current kings of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Senegalese</ENAMEX> hip - hop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daura G</ENAMEX> .
That kind of success needs no translation .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The World</ENAMEX> , I am <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Warmen</ENAMEX> .
