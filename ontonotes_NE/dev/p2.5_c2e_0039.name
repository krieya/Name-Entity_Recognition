These without a doubt were extremely beneficial to a young - aged girl to the extent that marrying a foreigner became popular and fashionable .
Latecomers outstripped their predecessors and most actually did n't think twice about it .
When they met a tall - nosed and blue - eyed man , sparks would always be ignited within the next <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three or five</ENAMEX> days .
What is pitiful about <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> women is that they know the men of their own race too well .
There is none of that beauty that comes from distance .
So they give up what is near to seek what is far away .
If you conscientiously study the emotional traits of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">western</ENAMEX> men , you will find that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> men are the most worthy of marrying .
The emotions of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> men lack a little romance , but instead are thick and solid .
Their direction is specific and definite .
They follow one of the world 's common truths that things will turn around when they become extreme .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> men truly understand the meaning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</ENAMEX> words " I love you . "
They not only imply a deep emotion of attachment but , even more , devotion and true love .
It enters a realm that is deeper and broader than just man and woman .
It is the crystallization of life after it has been melted down , concentrated into <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</ENAMEX> words .
Thus of course , it is not like when foreigners know you for <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</ENAMEX> days and then they lavish praise on you .
Of course , foreigners also have deep feelings .
But when it lacks that level , things seem to lack seriousness somewhat after all
