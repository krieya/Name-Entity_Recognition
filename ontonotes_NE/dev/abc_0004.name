The chief prosecutor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International War Crimes Tribunal</ENAMEX> has demanded the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> President hand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> over to face trial for war crimes , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , which has spent enormous amounts of time and energy fighting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> , seems more willing to wait <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> .
Here 's our national security correspondent , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John M Wethy</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Tonight</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> is still offering to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million</ENAMEX> for information leading to the arrest and conviction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> for war crimes .
I believe we can not ignore the actions of the war crimes tribunal .
I think we have to continue to support it , but there no longer seems to be any urgency about grabbing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> .
The important thing first is to get him out of any position of any kind of power .
Senior administration officials are now saying privately that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> never comes to trial , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> might not like it , but could live with it , as long as the man is gone .
The new President of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vojislav Kostunica</ENAMEX> , has made it clear he would not be likely to turn over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> or anyone else to the war crimes tribunal .
He says the tribunal is not fair and is manipulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> -- the same criticism <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> had , but in most ways , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vojislav Kostunica</ENAMEX> have starkly different views .
On freedom of the press , rule of law and a free market economy , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> opposed them all .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kostunica</ENAMEX> supports them .
His great advantage above all else is the fact that he is not corrupt .
He 's clean .
He seems as the most honorable man in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Serbian</ENAMEX> politics .
Like most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Serbs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kostunica</ENAMEX> is bitterly critical of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nato</ENAMEX> 's bombing campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
He also thinks the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> administration and especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX> pursued <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="5">anti-Serbian</ENAMEX> policies .
At the same time , in many respects , he is very <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="4">pro-American</ENAMEX> .
To help him , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> is moving quickly to lift economic sanctions and is exploring ways to send aid .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> now has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</ENAMEX> troops in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Balkans</ENAMEX> , at a cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</ENAMEX> a year .
The next step will be to look for ways to cut those numbers .
