The dollar finished softer <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , tilted lower by continued concern about the stock market .
`` We 're trading with a very wary eye on Wall Street , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trevor Woodland</ENAMEX> , chief corporate trader at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harris Trust -AMP- Savings Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
`` No one is willing to place a firm bet that the stock market wo n't take another tumultuous ride . ''
News of the major earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> triggered a round of dollar sales in early <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> trade , but most foreign - exchange dealers said they expect the impact of the quake on financial markets to be short - lived .
Despite the dollar 's lackluster performance , some foreign - exchange traders maintain that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> unit remains relatively well bid .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harris Trust 's</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodland</ENAMEX> noted that the unit continues to show resilience in the face of a barrage of `` headline negatives '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</ENAMEX> , including rate increases in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , aggressive central bank intervention , a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</ENAMEX> - point plunge in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> stock prices , an unexpectedly poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade report and action by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to nudge <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> rates lower .
While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodland</ENAMEX> does n't predict a significant climb for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> unit in light of recent moves in interest rates around the world , he noted that `` its downside potential is surprisingly and -- for dollar bulls -- `` impressively '' limited .
In late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8485 marks</ENAMEX> , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8667 marks</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Tuesday</ENAMEX> , and at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.45 yen</ENAMEX> , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.75 yen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Tuesday</ENAMEX> .
Sterling was quoted at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5920</ENAMEX> , up from $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5753</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Tuesday</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency opened for trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">140.97 yen</ENAMEX> , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.10 yen</ENAMEX> .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's dive in stock market prices , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> has injected reserves into the banking system in an effort to calm the markets and avert a repeat of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> 's stock market debacle .
Some analysts note that after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week 's</ENAMEX> stock market tailspin and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake , it 's hard to gauge where the central bank wants the key federal funds rate .
They say that the earthquake , by preventing many banks from operating at full capacity , has given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> an additional reason to keep liquidity at a high level .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> did , in fact , execute <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</ENAMEX> of liquidity - enhancing customer repurchase agreements , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> set of repurchase orders in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</ENAMEX> .
Analysts said the additional liquidity should tend to reduce the federal funds rate .
For now , traders say the foreign exchange market is scrutinizing both federal funds and events on Wall Street .
They note that the dollar remains extremely vulnerable to the slightest bad news from the stock exchange .
Indeed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> unit edged lower as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 13</ENAMEX> points in early trading .
A slight recovery in the stock market gave currency traders confidence to push the dollar higher before the unit dropped back by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> 's end .
Some dealers noted that nervousness over the recent sharp dive in stock prices could intensify following suggestions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita</ENAMEX> that appeared to advise <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investors to be very careful in investing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> leveraged buy - outs .
Dealers suggest that the only positive news on the horizon that could detract attention from equities transactions is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> consumer price data .
The figures , due for release <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , are expected to show an uptick in inflation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.8 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> .
If the figures show a hefty rise in inflation , they could militate against easing by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , gold for current delivery rose $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.30</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">368.70</ENAMEX> an ounce in moderate trading .
Estimated volume was <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three million ounces</ENAMEX> .
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> , gold was at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">368.15</ENAMEX> an ounce .
