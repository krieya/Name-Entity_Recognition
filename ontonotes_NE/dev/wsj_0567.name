A <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - day</ENAMEX> meeting of representatives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cocom</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> - nation group that oversees exports of sensitive goods to communist countries , did n't take any substantive decisions on trimming the list of items under controls .
Nor did it ease restrictions on exports to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials who attended the talks .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> had been under pressure from several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cocom</ENAMEX> members , especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> , to ease restrictions on some types of machine tools , which those countries argued were now widely available to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East Bloc</ENAMEX> countries from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG" S_OFF="4">non-Cocom</ENAMEX> members .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</ENAMEX> some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> countries have complained that outdated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cocom</ENAMEX> lists and restrictions served more to hamper their trade than to add to Western security .
Some countries also have been pressing for special treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> as they move toward more democratic rule , just as special treatment had been agreed on for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials said representatives at the meeting decided that this was `` a matter for further discussion at future meetings . ''
They added that `` all of us -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cocom</ENAMEX> members -RRB- look at the changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> in a positive way , but a question of this scope deserves further discussion and study . ''
The officials also said the meeting agreed to continue treating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> as a special case , despite the recent repression of dissent there , but to offer no further concessions .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials said that despite the rapid changes under way in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cocom</ENAMEX> members agreed on `` the continuing need for this organization , '' which was founded <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years ago</ENAMEX> at the start of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Cold War</ENAMEX> .
The officials said the meeting agreed to continue working toward `` streamlining '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cocom</ENAMEX> 's restricted products list , and to improve procedures for punishing companies that do n't comply with the export restrictions .
The officials said this meeting `` put in motion '' procedural steps that would speed up both of these functions , but that no specific decisions were taken on either matter .
