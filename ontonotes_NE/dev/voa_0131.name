Welcome to <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">this hour</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">VOA News Now</ENAMEX> .
I 'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erin Brumett</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
The incredibly close <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> vote count for President is in the state courts and heading for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the US Supreme Court</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the week</ENAMEX> .
That 's virtually unprecedented , as the federal courts have tended to stay out of elections , which are the responsibility of the states .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe O'Grossman</ENAMEX> is a professor of constitutional law at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Johns Hopkins University</ENAMEX> .
He says that in this instance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> probably felt the circumstances were such that they had no real alternative but to take the case .
Well , I think they took the case because it seemed like it was such a important issue that it would be kind of unseemly for them to try to reject it out of hand .
In fact , I think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Tribe</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvard Law School</ENAMEX> professor who is arguing for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> , is going to ask the court to hold the case , moot and dismiss it .
And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> campaign has brought the case , but recognizes that the particular issues that they brought to the court <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> are really not very relevant anymore .
They are going to probably , well , I know what they are going to do .
They are going to try to broaden the case to make it a kind of a general referendum on election procedures .
So , they are looking for a coronation , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> people at this point just want to get rid of this case , because they think they have a better chance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> courts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> generally support states ' rights .
So , does it appear somewhat ironic that they are going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> in this instance ?
No , I think first of all the notion that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> favor states ' rights and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> oppose it , is much too simplistic .
That 's generally true , but it 's only true on some issues , and in this case , you could argue that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> people are going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to preserve the right of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> , to determine its own electors .
So , there is a kind of states ' rights issue there , but they need , or at least they once thought they needed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to endorse it .
So it goes both ways .
What are the justices likely looking for ?
Well , I do n't know .
But I think that - and I think they will be divided , I mean I do n't think they will be unanimous .
Obviously , they would like to be able to achieve some kind of resolution of the case .
American election laws are often challenged at the local level and sometimes in the federal courts , but this is certainly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time we have had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> challenge over presidential election .
So , there is a lot of new law here to be made or at least law that has n't been made yet .
It 's possible that if the court accepts the invitation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> campaign , at least as it is expressed in the briefs they submitted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , that the court will in the sense , take the entire issue , even - not just the specific questions that it was asked <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> and try to resolve the question .
For example , if the court says it is clearly the fact that the legislature of the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> can determine for itself who its electors will be , that will pretty much end the case , because that 's what the legislature already plans to do , and that does n't mean the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> people wo n't keep trying , because ultimately <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> has to decide and only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> can decide if there are competing slates of electors submitted , which slate to accept .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Johns Hopkins University</ENAMEX> constitutional law professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe O'Grossman</ENAMEX> says , it 's still not certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> will actually hear the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> case .
As their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> order , of business <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , attorneys for Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> will move to have the court dismiss the case brought by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W Bush</ENAMEX> .
