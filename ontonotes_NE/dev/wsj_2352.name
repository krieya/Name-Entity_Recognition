The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> opinion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Arcadian Phosphate</ENAMEX> case did not repudiate the position <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pennzoil Co.</ENAMEX> took in its dispute with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texaco</ENAMEX> , contrary to your <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 8</ENAMEX> article `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Court Backs Texaco 's View in Pennzoil Case -- Too Late</ENAMEX> . ''
The fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pennzoil</ENAMEX> / Texaco litigation , the courts found <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pennzoil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Getty Oil</ENAMEX> intended to be bound ; in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Arcadian Phosphates</ENAMEX> they found there was no intention to be bound .
Admittedly , the principle in the cases is the same .
But the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts .
And the facts , as found by the various courts in these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> lawsuits , were different .
When you suggest otherwise , you leave the realm of reporting and enter the orbit of speculation .
