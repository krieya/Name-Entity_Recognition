Soldier Ants : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maysing Yang</ENAMEX> Calls for NGO Mobilization
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maysing Yang</ENAMEX> , vice chair of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Foreign Affairs '</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Research and Planning Board</ENAMEX> , lived for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
She joined <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's political opposition movement very early in her career , and for a time chaired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Democratic Progressive Party 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Foreign Affairs Committee</ENAMEX> .
After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> gained control of the central government , in view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang</ENAMEX> 's long overseas experience of diplomatic affairs and the overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> community , she was recruited into the cabinet to take over the important position of vice chair of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MOFA</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Research and Planning Board</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late August 2000</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maysing Yang</ENAMEX> and presidential advisor and former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peng Ming - min</ENAMEX> led a delegation to attend the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">53rd</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Annual DPI / NGO Conference</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations Department of Public Information</ENAMEX> .
She became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> serving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MOFA</ENAMEX> official to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> headquarters building since the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> .
When news of this got out , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PRC</ENAMEX> delegation at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> immediately pro-tested , and demanded that the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> should leave the conference chamber and be excluded from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> building .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">The next day</ENAMEX> , showing commendable courage , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peng</ENAMEX> slipped back into the conference chamber .
But their actions also attracted the criticism that this kind of high - decibel display is not in fact helpful for achieving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's return to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> .
However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang</ENAMEX> does not subscribe to this view .
Enthusiastic , outspoken and full of vitality , she is highly optimistic about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's prospects for participation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> - associated NGOs , and believes that as temples of popular campaigning , NGOs can develop the strength of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> people .
Below she describes her views .
After the new government took office , apart from being briefed on our diplomatic partners and on countries with which we do n't have diplomatic relations , I also looked at civic organizations with which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MOFA</ENAMEX> has contacts and which are frequently active in the international community .
I discovered that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the World League for Freedom and Democracy</ENAMEX> is a well - run international organization with a complete organizational structure , is a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Department of Public Information</ENAMEX> , and attends <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Annual DPI / NGO Conference</ENAMEX> every year .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</ENAMEX> too it was planning to attend the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">millennium</ENAMEX> edition of the conference .
Therefore when Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peng</ENAMEX> invited me to attend , I agreed to join the delegation as an advisor to the league .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MOFA</ENAMEX> was very excited about my attending the conference , because we can say that this is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MOFA</ENAMEX> official has entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> headquarters building in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 30 years</ENAMEX> .
Everyone thought it was a great breakthrough .
I also took the opportunity to personally get an understanding of how <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the DPI / NGO Conference</ENAMEX> works , and of the direction of mainstream international thinking , and I collected a lot of relevant information in the form of conference materials .
Thus we gained a great deal from attending .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of the main topics at this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> 's conference was the issue of how to go about monitoring how governments put into action their ideals and their promises to their peoples .
Another main focus of discussion was the partnership between NGOs , national governments and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> itself .
These are all very important things for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> to be thinking about , so we ought to participate more .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> itself is an organization of national governments .
At present we are excluded , and that is very difficult to change .
NGOs represent a very good point of access .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> there are a tremendous number of NGOs .
They hold frequent conferences , and they have an ever - growing influence on governments .
For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of months ago</ENAMEX> I went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> to attend <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the International Forum on Democracy</ENAMEX> .
The forum was attended by foreign ministers from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 100</ENAMEX> countries , but it was also an NGO conference .
Those attending included the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> entrepreneur <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Soros</ENAMEX> , who funded the forum , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Lord</ENAMEX> , and so on - all high - ranking , highly influential people .
In other words , NGOs are very broad church .
Retired diplomats , business - people , social campaigners , academics and all kinds of foundations may be involved in NGOs .
NGOs can be more powerful than governments , so governments certainly ca n t afford to ignore them .
At present , apart from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the World League for Freedom and Democracy</ENAMEX> , a number of other NGOs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> are associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> , including women 's , aboriginal and academic groups .
We hope that in the future more groups will actively develop an international profile , and apply to register with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> .
Another way people in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> can actively participate in international affairs is by encouraging people of ability and influence in society to apply to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> 's own NGOs , such as population , human rights , peace and environmental groups , so that they can contribute their knowledge , and at the same time let others better understand people from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
We are living in an age of people power , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> is responding to the trends of our time .
In the past , NGOs merely played a monitoring role at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> , but now the trend is towards their involvement in policy implementation .
Hence in our future approach to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> , besides continuing to press for admission by mobilizing our diplomatic partners to speak on our behalf , we should also actively seek to make the most of the power of our people .
In particular , in the age of the Internet , universal values such as humanitarianism and human rights transcend the narrow confines of national boundaries and nationalism .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> issue is one of basic human rights .
In other words , the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> are being denied the right to speak and vote in international affairs .
We can use the Internet to gain the support of international champions of justice .
Furthermore , among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> compatriots living overseas there are many who opposed the old government , but are willing to support the new .
These people are excellent partners through whom we can participate in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> NGOs .
We should n't be afraid of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> communist regime 's attempts to suppress such activity
.
They wo n't last forever , and they ca n't discourage everyone who supports us .
