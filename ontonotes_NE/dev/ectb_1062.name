<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> diplomatic ally in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Central America</ENAMEX> , was hit on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 13</ENAMEX> by an earthquake measuring between <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.9</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richter</ENAMEX> scale .
The earthquake killed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> and left <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</ENAMEX> homeless .
As soon as reports of the earthquake came in , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> government donated <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 200,000</ENAMEX> to support disaster relief efforts , and within <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</ENAMEX> had dispatched a team to help rescue victims .
It truly does seem that " when it rains , it pours , " for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> was then visited on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 26</ENAMEX> by its biggest earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</ENAMEX> , and according to official estimates the death toll may rise to over <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</ENAMEX> .
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> does not have official ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sinorama</ENAMEX> went to press on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 29</ENAMEX> rescue teams from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> were standing by for departure , awaiting only the go - ahead from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> .
Just <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">short of noon on Saturday , January 13</ENAMEX> , most everyone in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX> was at home preparing for lunch when the earth below their feet suddenly began to shake violently .
Just outside the capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Salvador</ENAMEX> , a hillside collapsed in the community of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Colinas</ENAMEX> , burying <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 260</ENAMEX> homes and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,200</ENAMEX> residents .
As of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 29</ENAMEX> , the confirmed toll from the earthquake stood at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">726</ENAMEX> dead and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,440</ENAMEX> injured , with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120,000</ENAMEX> homes either totally or partially destroyed and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 980,000</ENAMEX> left homeless .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</ENAMEX> aftershocks have hit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 13</ENAMEX> .
The difficulty of emergency rescue efforts has been greatly exacerbated by collapsed road surfaces and interrupted power , water , and telephone services .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Flores</ENAMEX> declared a state of emergency , called for an all - out effort to save lives , and asked for international relief assistance .
Hell on earth
Relief teams and supplies began arriving from around the world on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> after the quake .
In addition to teams from nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guatemala</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Spanish</ENAMEX> team also arrived very quickly , followed soon thereafter by counterparts from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Taipei City Government 's</ENAMEX> international search and rescue team arrived on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 16</ENAMEX> .
This team , which had received <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</ENAMEX> of training in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , went immediately into action after their long air trip , as the search and rescue command center in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX> arranged for it to head to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Colinas</ENAMEX> , where the worst of the disaster had taken place .
The team started out using advanced equipment capable of detecting signs of life under the rubble , including flexible fiber optic video cables and ultra-sensitive audio devices .
When these methods did not yield survivors , the team began digging and using more aggressive search techniques .
These methods , too , failed to turn up any sign of life .
At that point relief teams went into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Colinas</ENAMEX> with bulldozers and mechanical shovels to clear out the rubble and retrieve the bodies of the dead .
In his condolence message to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Shui - bian</ENAMEX> stated that the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , having suffered a terrible earthquake of their own in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1999</ENAMEX> , were acutely aware of what people in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX> were going through .
In addition to the relief assistance provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> government , a lot of aid also poured forth from the private sector .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The ROC Red Cross Society</ENAMEX> donated <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</ENAMEX> blankets and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</ENAMEX> tents .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Chinese Children 's Fund</ENAMEX> is planning to send <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 300,000</ENAMEX> in private donations via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ENAMEX> to provide support for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</ENAMEX> children .
The governments of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taichung County</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nantou County</ENAMEX> , which were hardest hit by the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</ENAMEX> earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , also made big contributions to the relief effort .
Teams from these areas arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX> armed with experience , an advanced global positioning system , and tunneling equipment .
They also donated tents and other necessities .
In the dark days following <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">September 1999 earthquake</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</ENAMEX> donated <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 27,890,000</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , and these funds proved a tremendous help in our reconstruction effort .
International relief teams worked around the clock to find survivors , and thousands made homeless by the quake sheltered from the cold in donated tents and sleeping bags .
Even the dead in many cases were transported to their final resting places in donated body bags and coffins .
Now that a similar disaster has been visited upon one of our diplomatic partners , it is time for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> to repay its debt to the international community .
The power of nature
Major earthquakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> have claimed nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</ENAMEX> lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> and over <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
The death toll in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX> is expected to climb to over <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,300</ENAMEX> .
In the meantime , the <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Richter 7.9</ENAMEX> earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> 's western state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gujarat</ENAMEX> has completely leveled the town of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bhuj</ENAMEX> , and official sources expect the death toll to exceed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</ENAMEX> .
While relief teams have been dispatched from around the world , India indicated that it would not need assistance from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> for the time being .
There is nothing anyone can do to prevent earthquakes from occurring , but specialists have noted that the consequences of the recent quakes were made worse by man - made factors , such as overpopulation , environmental degradation , and shoddy construction .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX> is the most densely populated nation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Central America</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 6 million</ENAMEX> people living in a territory covering over <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20,000 square kilometers</ENAMEX> -LRB- about <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two - thirds</ENAMEX> the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
The economy has been developing briskly ever since the country 's long civil war came to an end in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX> plays an important political role both internationally and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Central American</ENAMEX> region .
In these respects , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador 's</ENAMEX> situation is very similar to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
Overdevelopment of the hillside at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Colinas</ENAMEX> may have been one cause of the landslide that buried the residential neighborhood down below .
After one has seen so many dead bodies and heard the anguished wailing of bereaved relatives , it is hard to ignore the wisdom of calls to live in harmony with nature .
It takes a very long time to recover from an earthquake .
After the search and rescue operations have come to an end , reconstruction begins .
This is a massive undertaking that never proceeds quickly .
In a message to the international community , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flores</ENAMEX> stated , " I hope that relief assistance has not come to an end .
It should continue as we work on reconstruction . "
If anyone in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> wishes to contribute to reconstruction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX> , they are urged to contact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ENAMEX> ' task force on reconstruction -LRB- tel : <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02 - 2348 - 2192</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02 - 2348 - 2195</ENAMEX> -RRB- .

Most of the deaths -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">549</ENAMEX> -RRB- were the result of a landslide in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Colinas</ENAMEX> , on the outskirts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Salvador</ENAMEX> .
