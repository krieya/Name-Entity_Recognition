<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Instruments Inc.</ENAMEX> , once a pioneer in portable computer technology , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> will make a bid to reassert itself in that business by unveiling <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> small personal computers .
The announcements are scheduled to be made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Temple</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> , and include a so - called `` notebook '' PC that weighs <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than seven pounds</ENAMEX> , has a built - in hard disk drive and is powered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intel Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">286</ENAMEX> microprocessor .
That introduction comes <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only two weeks</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Compaq Computer Corp.</ENAMEX> , believing it had a lead of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three to six months</ENAMEX> on competitors , introduced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> notebook computer with such features .
Despite the inevitable comparison with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Compaq</ENAMEX> , however , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Instruments '</ENAMEX> new notebook wo n't be a direct competitor .
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Compaq</ENAMEX> sells its machines to businesses through computer retailers , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> will be selling most of its machines to the industrial market and to value - added resellers and original - equipment manufacturers .
The introductions also mark <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Instruments '</ENAMEX> plunge back into a technology it has all but ignored for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several years</ENAMEX> .
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> - based computer giant introduced the first portable data terminal in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</ENAMEX> -- a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">38 - pound</ENAMEX> monster -- and the world 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> microprocessor - based portable in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</ENAMEX> , the only portable machines it has introduced since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> part of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</ENAMEX> have been `` dumb '' terminals with limited on - board processing ability .
It stopped selling a standard personal computer a while ago .
Now that is about to change , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> begins marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two 14 - pound</ENAMEX> laptop PCs with <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 megabyte</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 megabyte</ENAMEX> hard drives .
The laptops are not revolutionary and , indeed , are tardy in a market first opened by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GRiD Systems Corp.</ENAMEX> , now a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tandy Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">almost two years ago</ENAMEX> .
But the notebook , with the more advanced microprocessor and hard disk , is more innovative .
Weighing <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.7 pounds</ENAMEX> with battery , the notebook measures <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8.2 by 11.7 inches</ENAMEX> , has a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 - megabyte</ENAMEX> hard disk drive and boasts a backlit screen that is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</ENAMEX> larger than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's .
Its keyboard , according to industry consultants , is better than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's , but its battery life of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">two to three hours</ENAMEX> is shorter .
It does n't have an internal floppy disk drive , although a snap - on drive can be purchased separately .
Its greatest drawback may be its <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 - inch</ENAMEX> thickness , big enough for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> consultant to describe it as `` clunky . ''
List prices on the heavier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Instrument</ENAMEX> laptops will be $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4,999</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the TI Model 25</ENAMEX> , with a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 megabyte</ENAMEX> disk drive , and $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5,599</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 - megabyte</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model 45</ENAMEX> .
The notebook , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the TI Model 12</ENAMEX> , will be priced at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4,199</ENAMEX> .
