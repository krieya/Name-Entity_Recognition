<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The National Syrian Party</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> , and Very Dangerous Facts
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Shaheen2005</ENAMEX>
At a time when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> judiciary continues its investigation into the file of the detainees of " <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Syrian National Social Party</ENAMEX> , " very important , and at the same time , dangerous , information was revealed about an attempt to blow up the location of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Phalange</ENAMEX> celebration in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Al Koura</ENAMEX> , which was set to be attended by president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amin Al Gemayel</ENAMEX> , Minister and martyr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Al Gemayel</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of supporters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Lebanese Phalange Party</ENAMEX> , per an order from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parliament</ENAMEX> Member <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asaad Herdan</ENAMEX> . That was " <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cailion</ENAMEX> " restaurant in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Al Koura</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 15 , 2005</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">29 days</ENAMEX> before the crime of the assassination of Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafiq Al Hariri</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</ENAMEX> after the assassination attempt of Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marwan Hamada</ENAMEX> , which would have raised the number of crimes and explosions to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</ENAMEX> .
Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gemayel</ENAMEX> was assassinated by gunshots in an armed attack on his procession in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jadida</ENAMEX> sector on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st of last November</ENAMEX> .
Information states that the security official of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Syrian National Social Party</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toni Mansour</ENAMEX> , admitted in the investigation that , after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Phalange Party</ENAMEX> set a date for the celebration to be held in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">North</ENAMEX> with the attendance of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gemayel</ENAMEX> and his son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 15 , 2005</ENAMEX> , he received an order from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parliament</ENAMEX> Member <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asaad Herdan</ENAMEX> to " blow up " the celebration .
In implementing the orders , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mansour</ENAMEX> went with a group of his assistants on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 13 , 2005</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</ENAMEX> before the celebration , to the restaurant , where he started to plant an explosive package containing <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 kilograms</ENAMEX> of " T. N. T. " substance .
But he was surprised that the timer he had brought had a manufacturing defect , which forced him to postpone the mission for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">another day</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mansour</ENAMEX> states that it was decided to replant the explosive package <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</ENAMEX> before the start of the celebration .
He went to the restaurant with his assistants , but he was surprised that a security siege had surrounded the place before the time set for the celebration , which forced him to cancel his project .
Yet the ongoing investigation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mansour</ENAMEX> and his assistants did not reach a reliable criminal connection between the assassination attempt on President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gemayel</ENAMEX> and his son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre</ENAMEX> , which was postponed for reasons beyond their control in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">North</ENAMEX> , and the assassination crime that was committed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jadida</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> of a party tour by Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gemayel</ENAMEX> of the northern party members , which was described as having achieved excellent results .
The international investigation committee , under the leadership of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Belgian</ENAMEX> Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serge Brammertz</ENAMEX> , was assigned to assist in revealing the assassination crime of Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gemayel</ENAMEX> .
The procedure the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> judiciary will take against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parliament</ENAMEX> Member <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asaad Herdan</ENAMEX> is not known , after he was proved to have given orders to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mansour</ENAMEX> to perform an explosive operation that was supposed to kill the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Phalange</ENAMEX> leadership and its party members .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">The Lebanese Constitution</ENAMEX> states that immunity should be removed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parliament</ENAMEX> members if they are pursued for penal crimes , in case the council was in a holding round .
The normal -LSB- round -RSB- period ended at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of last December</ENAMEX> without opening an exceptional round .
An explosive package of this size had exploded in several areas in the northern -LSB- board -RSB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Ashrafieh</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jounieh</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Kasslik</ENAMEX> , between <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March 18 , 2005</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May 7 of the same year</ENAMEX> .
Also , in the framework of this judicial investigation , criminal experts stated that the explosives that were found in the houses of the arrestees of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Syrian National Social Party</ENAMEX> , together with <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two hundred kilograms</ENAMEX> of " T. N. T. " substance , entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> market in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2000</ENAMEX> , which refutes all that has been said , that the explosives and weapons go back to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighties of the last century</ENAMEX> when the party was a brigade in the national resistance against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> occupation in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> .

Would <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> admit what it is doing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> after these confessions , or it will deny its agents and actions as usual , with false shameful justifications ?
Day after day , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> 's connection to all the terrorist incidents that happen in sister <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> is proven , as the ignorance , shallow mindedness , and methodology of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Syrian</ENAMEX> politicians is proven to everyone .
