Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> are trying to head off an appointment by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> to the board that oversees the savings - and - loan bailout , contending that the prospective nominee is the head of troubled banks himself .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House Banking Committee</ENAMEX> sent President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> a letter stating their concerns about the expected appointment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Simmons</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> banker and former fund - raiser for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corp</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Oversight Board</ENAMEX> , created in the savings - and - loan law signed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , sets policy for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTC</ENAMEX> , which will sell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of the nation 's sick thrifts and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</ENAMEX> of their assets .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> are members of the board .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> must appoint <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> other members , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> .
An administration official confirmed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> , the chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Valley National Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phoenix</ENAMEX> , is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> appointee , and that a security clearance was under way .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> appointee has n't been determined , the official said .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> declined to comment , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> said the congressmen 's letter is under review .
The letter , dated <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Thursday</ENAMEX> , cited the losses at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Valley National</ENAMEX> , and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Bank</ENAMEX> , also of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phoenix</ENAMEX> , where Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> was chairman for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">29 years</ENAMEX> .
Both banks have been battered , as have other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> banks , by falling real estate prices .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Valley National</ENAMEX> , for example , had <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 470 million</ENAMEX> in problem assets as of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> .
`` We believe that there are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you to give them your thorough consideration before making this key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTC</ENAMEX> appointment , '' the letter said .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTC</ENAMEX> needs the most able , competent management available . ''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> has long ties to both <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> and banking .
He was co-chairman of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> campaign committee in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year 's</ENAMEX> election , and also worked for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> election .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> met <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 30 years ago</ENAMEX> , when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Commercial Bank -AMP- Trust Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Midland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> , where Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> was an organizing director .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> also served on a committee of businessmen headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Seidman</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Resolution Trust Corp</ENAMEX> .
That committee determined to open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> to banking across state lines .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Arizona Trend</ENAMEX> magazine referred to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</ENAMEX> most influential people in the state .
The letter to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> was signed by Reps. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Vento</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minn.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Banking Committee 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTC Task Force</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas McMillen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Md.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kweisi Mfume</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Md .</ENAMEX> -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Kanjorski</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa .</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
