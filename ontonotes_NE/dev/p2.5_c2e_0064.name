<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rwanda</ENAMEX> have fallen out with each other .
They have expelled each others ' diplomats and closed their embassies .
Lastly , the government of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rwanda</ENAMEX> announced that it was cutting off diplomatic relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> entirely .
The cause is said to be that a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> judge issued an international warrant for the arrest of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nine</ENAMEX> important members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Rwandan</ENAMEX> government on the charge that they participated in the assassination of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rwanda</ENAMEX> 's former president <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twelve</ENAMEX> years before .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Rwandan</ENAMEX> government has resolutely denied the charge , while the international community has likewise not come to any conclusion regarding the affair .
It is simply that the families of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> flight crew have brought the case to the court in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> when the former president was killed and thus , that judge and the government want to hold their own law over the heads of others .
If you put aside whether the evidence is conclusive and look only at the obstacles from international law that the case will inevitably face , you will know that this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">French</ENAMEX> faux - pas against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rwanda</ENAMEX> on this occasion is extremely unwise .
The international media has found a few surprises during President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX> 's visits to the <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four</ENAMEX> nations of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laos</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> :
Receiving " extraordinary - level reception " in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> , according to most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> media , were , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX> in the first and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> in the second ; a break with diplomatic convention when both the general secretary and the chairman accompanied <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX> during the troop review ; the meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abe</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh Moo - hyun</ENAMEX> and others with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX> was safely held in the hotel where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX> was staying , thereby making it resemble an audience with an emperor .
And this even resulted in the international media closely chasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX> in his footsteps as he made this trip on his subsequent trips to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laos</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> had already taken itself to this step , it would n't seem possible to not be in the international media headlines if it ever wishes not to .
For example , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> shook hands , it implied that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</ENAMEX> of the people on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> had reconciled .
What was there in the international news that was more attention - grabbing than that .
