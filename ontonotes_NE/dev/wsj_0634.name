<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dentsu Inc.</ENAMEX> , the world 's largest advertising agency on the strength of its dominance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> market , is setting its sights on overseas expansion .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dentsu</ENAMEX> started <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">HDM</ENAMEX> , a joint network with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> ad agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Young -AMP- Rubicam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eurocom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A few months ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dentsu</ENAMEX> acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Australian</ENAMEX> agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fortune Communication Holdings Ltd.</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.9 million Australian dollars</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 4.6 million</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dentsu</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> subsidiaries , but they keep low profiles .
Now , the giant marketing company , which holds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.4 trillion yen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30.96 billion</ENAMEX> -RRB- advertising industry , is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> .
What is driving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dentsu</ENAMEX> 's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> clients as they grow in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> .
`` If we do n't do something ... we wo n't be able to catch up with demand , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dentsu</ENAMEX> spokesman .
`` Our president said acquisition is an effective method . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dentsu</ENAMEX> 's foreign business accounted for less than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> of total billings , but the company is aiming at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</ENAMEX> in the near future .
So far , it appears cautious about taking the big step .
For example , the spokesman says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dentsu</ENAMEX> has been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> marketing group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi -AMP- Saatchi PLC</ENAMEX> .
But he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dentsu</ENAMEX> has n't looked seriously at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi</ENAMEX> .
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dentsu</ENAMEX> says it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines , it is laying the groundwork for international growth .
It is setting up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year ended March 31</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dentsu</ENAMEX> sales rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.9 billion</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.5 billion</ENAMEX> , and net income jumped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 102 million</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 64 million</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dentsu</ENAMEX> 's billings <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> were larger than those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Young -AMP- Rubicam</ENAMEX> , the world 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> - largest ad agency , according to a survey by the publication <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Advertising Age</ENAMEX> .
But success overseas in unfamiliar markets could be trickier than for other industries such as manufacturers .
On its own , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dentsu</ENAMEX> 's muscle in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> may count for little in major foreign markets when seeking <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="4">non-Japanese</ENAMEX> clients .
Thus , an acquisition may prove the necessary course .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> agencies are cautious about expanding abroad because client relationships are different .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry , a practice `` that would be unacceptable by traditional Western conflict rules , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Warman</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi -AMP- Saatchi 's</ENAMEX> communications division .
Although acquiring a foreign company would expand <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> advertising agencies ' business to foreign clients , many clients would also be <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> companies expanding overseas , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dentsu</ENAMEX> spokesman .
But the different business system would make it hard for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dentsu</ENAMEX> to provide these <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> companies the same kind of services they do in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
