<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow PLC</ENAMEX> intends to change its name to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manpower PLC</ENAMEX> and write off a chunk of the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 1.2 billion</ENAMEX> in good will realized in the takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manpower Inc</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell Fromstein</ENAMEX> said in an interview that the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> steps may be a prelude to reincorporating the world 's biggest employment - services group in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fromstein</ENAMEX> disclosed the planned steps , expected within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</ENAMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow</ENAMEX> posted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</ENAMEX> drop in its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">third - quarter</ENAMEX> pretax earnings .
The name change and good will write - off could help solidify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow 's</ENAMEX> dominance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> temporary - help market and give it a more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> image as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's market plunge .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> holders now own <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 60 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow</ENAMEX> compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last January</ENAMEX> .
`` In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> market , the recognition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manpower</ENAMEX> name is infinitely stronger than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fromstein</ENAMEX> said .
The moves also could erase shareholders ' perception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow</ENAMEX> as a company in turmoil .
`` It further reinforces the concept that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow</ENAMEX> is a thing of the past , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Arthur</ENAMEX> , an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder Peabody -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
The proposed changes `` all make a lot of sense to me , '' he added .
In a widely publicized boardroom coup , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fromstein</ENAMEX> ousted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antony Berry</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow</ENAMEX> chief executive in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</ENAMEX> after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry</ENAMEX> had forced Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fromstein</ENAMEX> out as the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</ENAMEX> - a - year chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milwaukee</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manpower</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fromstein</ENAMEX> solidified his control in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April</ENAMEX> by taking over from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry</ENAMEX> as chairman .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow</ENAMEX> tumult is n't over yet , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> government is investigating a disputed <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 25 million</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 39.4 million</ENAMEX> -RRB- loan which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fromstein</ENAMEX> has said was made under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry</ENAMEX> 's direction .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow</ENAMEX> was able to pull off the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.34 billion</ENAMEX> takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manpower</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> largely because different <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> companies .
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> rules , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow</ENAMEX> was able to write off at once the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.15 billion</ENAMEX> in good will arising from the purchase .
As a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - based company , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow</ENAMEX> would have to amortize the good will over as many as <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years</ENAMEX> , creating a continuing drag on reported earnings .
Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm , operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets .
But with so many shares now held in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow</ENAMEX> reports its earnings <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> ways , based on both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> accounting standards .
`` Our balance sheets look like they came from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX> 's wonderland , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fromstein</ENAMEX> said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> version shows `` a handful of pounds of net worth '' following the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> write - off of good will , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> version reflects `` <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> of net worth because almost none of -LCB- the good will -RCB- has been written off . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fromstein</ENAMEX> said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> books in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> fell swoop , but would n't specify how much .
People close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow</ENAMEX> suggested the write - down would represent a sizable chunk , with executives claiming prior management overstated the extent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manpower</ENAMEX> 's good will .
That move , along with the return to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manpower</ENAMEX> name , could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help .
The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> temporary workers fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12 months ending Aug. 31</ENAMEX> , after sliding nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder Peabody 's</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Arrow</ENAMEX> blamed the pretax profit drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter ended July 31</ENAMEX> partly on slower earnings growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG" S_OFF="4">non-Manpower</ENAMEX> units in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> .
Overall , pretax profit slid to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 18.49 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 18.98 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> .
