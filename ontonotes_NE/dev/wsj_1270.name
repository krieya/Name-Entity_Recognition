but worries about <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> .
With most legislatures adjourned for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</ENAMEX> , small business is tallying its scorecard .
Much of its attention was spent fighting organized labor 's initiatives on issues the small - business community traditionally opposes -- from raising state minimum wage levels to mandating benefits in health plans .
While results were mixed in many states , `` small business got by fairly well , '' concludes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don L. Robinson</ENAMEX> , associate director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Federation of Independent Business</ENAMEX> , the largest small - business organization .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</ENAMEX> states -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> -- passed bills to boost the minimum wage , but measures in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</ENAMEX> other states were defeated .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> 's rate will rise to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.75</ENAMEX> an hour , the nation 's highest , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 1 , 1991</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> 's will be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> highest -- at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.65</ENAMEX> an hour in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1992</ENAMEX> -- but small - business lobbyists won an exclusion for tiny concerns and a lower training rate .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> central states , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> small - business count shows lawmakers adopted <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</ENAMEX> bills mandating health coverage or parental leave .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Illinois Legislature</ENAMEX> narrowly passed a parental - leave bill , which Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Thompson</ENAMEX> vetoed , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> amended laws to require that employers pay for breast - cancer exams .
Small business is bracing for an avalanche of similar proposals <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
`` Those kinds of issues always keep coming back , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Beckwith</ENAMEX> , who manages the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> 's small - business office .
DESPITE VICTORIES <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , small business fears losing parental - leave war .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</ENAMEX> states -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> others requiring private employers to grant leaves of absence to employees with newborn or adopted infants .
Similar proposals were defeated in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 15</ENAMEX> other states .
But small business , which generally detests government - mandated benefits , has taken note of the growing number of close votes .
`` It 's just a matter of time before the tide turns , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Midwestern</ENAMEX> lobbyist .
Consequently , small business is taking more `` pro-active '' steps to counter mandated leaves .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> , small businesses are pushing for a voluntary alternative ; they favor a commission that would develop sample leave policies that employers could adopt .
They also support a tax credit for employers to offset the cost of hiring and training workers who temporarily replace employees on parental leave .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> , the issue is expected to be especially close in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> .
`` We 'll be playing a lot of defense , especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Midwest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northeast</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Buente</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NFIB</ENAMEX> .
IN <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS ANGELES</ENAMEX> , more small businesses ponder adopting a child - care policy .
Triggering the re-examination is a recent city council decision to give preference in letting city contracts to suppliers with a stated policy on child care for their employees .
The preferential treatment even applies to awarding small contracts <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">under $ 25,000</ENAMEX> and consulting and temporary services -- which often go to the smaller concerns .
Firms are permitted wide flexibility in the child - care arrangements they provide .
Council member <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joy Picus</ENAMEX> , the measure 's chief advocate , considers it part of a `` pro-family policy '' that makes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> a leader in `` humanizing the workplace . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">NOVEMBER</ENAMEX> BALLOTS will contain few referendum or initiative issues that especially affect small business .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , small businesses are urging passage of a local initiative to build a new <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 95 million</ENAMEX> downtown baseball stadium ; they believe it will spur retail sales and hotel - restaurant business .
But in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> state , small business generally opposes an initiative to boost spending on children 's programs by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 360 million</ENAMEX> , fearing the state 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.8 %</ENAMEX> sales tax will be raised to finance the outlays .
DIALING DOLLARS :
Small businesses in suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> are discovering that an area - code switch <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 11</ENAMEX> -- to 708 from the familiar 312 -- wo n't be without some costs as they alter stationery , among other things , and notify customers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wessels -AMP- Pautsch</ENAMEX> , a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Charles</ENAMEX> law firm , plans to mail <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> customers a list of its lawyers ' new phone and fax numbers as well as updated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rolodex</ENAMEX> cards .
But many owners plan to practice frugality -- crossing out the old code and writing in the new one until their stock runs out .
Even print - shop operator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clay Smith</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naperville</ENAMEX> wo n't discard his old supply .
-LRB- He reports his business is up slightly from customers replacing old stock . -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CALIFORNIA</ENAMEX> , A TREND - SETTER in franchising rules , stirs a controversy .
With some new rules , state officials say they made it easier -- and faster -- to sell new franchises whose terms stray from those in state - registered contracts .
Previously , regulators insisted that franchisers pre-register such changes with the state -- a costly process taking <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at least six weeks</ENAMEX> .
Now some negotiated sales that meet a series of tests do n't have to be pre-registered .
For instance , franchisers no longer must pre-register sales to aspiring franchisees who qualify as `` sophisticated purchasers . ''
Such buyers must have a minimum net worth of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</ENAMEX> , $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">200,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> income , or recent experience in the business area of the franchise being sold .
But critics consider the changes regressive .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis G. Rudnick</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> lawyer who represents franchisers , contends <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> is narrowly limiting -- rather than expanding -- opportunities for negotiating sales .
He argues <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> regulators historically have misinterpreted their law -- and he says negotiated sales that are n't pre-registered have been legal all along .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy H. Fine</ENAMEX> , who represents franchisees , insists <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's cautiousness helps protect franchisees from crafty sales negotiators who push unlawful clauses .

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 4 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> small businesses surveyed say they 've tested an employee or applicant for drug or alcohol use ... .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT" E_OFF="3">52%-36</ENAMEX> % , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NFIB</ENAMEX> members favor laws to limit foreign ownership of land and facilities in the state .
