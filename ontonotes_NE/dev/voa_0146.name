At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the United Nations</ENAMEX> , controversy has broken out over a proposal to drastically tighten sanctions against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> government in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VOA</ENAMEX> correspondent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breck Ardery</ENAMEX> has more on this from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the United Nations</ENAMEX> .
A proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN Security Council</ENAMEX> resolution jointly sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> would tighten economic sanctions against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> and ban all weapon shipments to them .
The proposal goes considerably beyond the existing sanctions , which ban <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> air flights and freeze international bank accounts held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> .
Sponsors say the resolution is specifically meant to pressure the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> , to abandon its support of terrorism , and to surrender indicted terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama Bin Laden</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> 's Ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamsed Ahmed</ENAMEX> told reporters his nation is strongly against the resolution and it is the wrong way to fight terrorism .
We abhor terrorism in all its forms and manifestations .
We are with the international community in combating this menace all over the world .
As far as this particular individual is concerned , this is a problem that needs to be resolved between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> and the government in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> , which now is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmad</ENAMEX> says that instead of sanctions , the international community should engage in a dialogue with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> 's Ambassador <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serge Lavroff</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> leadership does not inspire trust .
The problem is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> never delivered on a single promise , be this to resume , to start the dialogue , be this to stop fighting , be this to treat women and girls properly , or any other demand from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Security Council</ENAMEX> , in particular to stop the support for terrorism .
An <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> official told reporters the proposed new sanctions are not meant to harm the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghan</ENAMEX> people .
He points out that humanitarian aid is specifically exempt from the sanctions .
He says , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> is currently the largest single donor of food and relief supplies to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghan</ENAMEX> people and that the aid will continue .
