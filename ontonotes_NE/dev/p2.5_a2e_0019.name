Since the outbreak of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> Revolution in the year <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</ENAMEX> and the overthrow of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shah</ENAMEX> 's regime , and in spite of the power he enjoyed and the privilege he had with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> countries , and in spite of the presence of the strongest intelligence service in the region -LRB- the SAVAK Agency -RRB- , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> public was able to overthrow the government through the leadership of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mullahs</ENAMEX> -LRB- religious men -RRB- without action from the super powers which had supported the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shah</ENAMEX> 's regime .
This raises many questions .
At the same time that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mullahs</ENAMEX> came to power in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> , another revolution erupted , but with a different course .
It took place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</ENAMEX> under the leadership of a few people led by the Engineer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gulbuddin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hekmatyar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheikh Abdul Rabb Rasoul Sayyaf</ENAMEX> .
But the general course of jihad and the influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">mujahideen</ENAMEX> in large numbers started in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> after the heroic Ansar battle in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jagi</ENAMEX> .
While the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> governments were busy with the issue of repelling <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> occupation and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">communist</ENAMEX> encroachment , and with the war between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> , many overlooked a new development that was emerging on the ground , namely the orientation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiites</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Gulf region</ENAMEX> towards arms training in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">the Revolutionary Guards</ENAMEX> at the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraqi</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> war , as well as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> -LRB- in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the nineties</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
However , the general orientation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiites</ENAMEX> towards regular and intensive training actually started in the early <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nineties</ENAMEX> .
