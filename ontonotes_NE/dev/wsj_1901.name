<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South Korean</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh Tae Woo</ENAMEX> , brushing aside suggestions that the won be revalued again , said the currency 's current level against the dollar is `` appropriate . ''
His comments , made in response to reporters ' questions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Press Club</ENAMEX> here , signaled that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seoul</ENAMEX> is resisting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> pressure for a further rise in the currency 's value .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> wants a higher won to make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea 's</ENAMEX> exports more expensive and help trim <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seoul</ENAMEX> 's trade surplus .
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South Korean</ENAMEX> business people want a devaluation instead , arguing that the won 's recent gains already have weakened the country 's export performance .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh</ENAMEX> also said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> is taking steps that would free the won to respond to market forces .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seoul</ENAMEX> has pointed to its lack of a foreign exchange market as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> reason the won 's value remains heavily controlled .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh</ENAMEX> said a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> demand for the removal of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South Korean</ENAMEX> import quotas on beef will be resolved `` satisfactorily '' but gave no hint when that will happen .
Speaking to a joint meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> earlier , he said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> ca n't move quickly on such agricultural trade issues `` without causing political and social trauma .
