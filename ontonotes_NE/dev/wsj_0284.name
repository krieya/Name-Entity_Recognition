A federal judge ruled that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imelda Marcos</ENAMEX> was n't brought to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> against her will and that marital privileges , which protect spouses from incriminating each other , do n't apply in her case .
As a result , Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. Keenan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> ordered Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> to turn over to the court all pleadings and documents she may have filed in foreign countries in opposition to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> requests for evidence .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> had claimed that she did n't have to turn over the documents because she was brought here involuntarily and because providing the materials would violate her marital privilege .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year and a half</ENAMEX> after Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> and her late husband , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand Marcos</ENAMEX> , the ousted president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> , fled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> , they were charged with racketeering , conspiracy , obstruction of justice and mail fraud in a scheme in which they allegedly embezzled <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 100 million</ENAMEX> from their homeland .
Much of the money was fraudulently concealed through purchases of prime <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> real estate , federal prosecutors have charged .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> 's trial is expected to begin in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> law requires criminal defendants to turn over foreign documents such as those sought in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> case .
The law is meant to overcome delays caused by defendants ' use of foreign procedures to block <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> requests for records , Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keenan</ENAMEX> said in his opinion .
For instance , the documents could involve foreign business dealings or bank accounts .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> has charged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcoses</ENAMEX> ' alleged crimes involved bank accounts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and other countries .
On the allegation of kidnapping , Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keenan</ENAMEX> wrote , `` The suggestion that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> was brought to this country against her will is unsupported by affidavit or affirmation . ''
The judge also said the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> marital testimonial privileges cited by Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> do n't apply .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> one permits a witness to refuse to testify against her spouse .
But Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keenan</ENAMEX> said that privilege 's purpose is `` fostering harmony in marriage . ''
Because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> died <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 28</ENAMEX> , the privilege can no longer apply , the judge said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> marital privilege cited by Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> protects confidential communications between spouses .
But Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keenan</ENAMEX> said that privilege is meant to protect private utterances -- not litigation papers filed with foreign governments , as Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> 's attorneys maintained .
Though Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keenan</ENAMEX> threw out most of Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> 's objections , he agreed with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of her concerns : that turning over the foreign documents could violate the defendant 's constitutional right against self - incrimination .
As a result , he said he will examine the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> documents sought by the prosecutors to determine whether turning over the filings is self - incrimination .
Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keenan</ENAMEX> also directed the prosecutors to show that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Amendment</ENAMEX> right against self - incrimination wo n't be violated .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> 's attorney in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandor Frankel</ENAMEX> , declined to comment on the ruling .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> has n't admitted that she filed any documents such as those sought by the government .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles LaBella</ENAMEX> , the assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney prosecuting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> case , did n't return phone calls seeking comment .
