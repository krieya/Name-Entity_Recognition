After entering into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WTO</ENAMEX> , we frequently see that the viewpoint of reporters when criticizing domestic banks is : When the foreign - funded banks arrive later on , if your service attitude does n't improve a bit , I will take my money and deposit it in a foreign - funded bank .
Then we 'll see what these state - owned banks do !
Furthermore , we frequently see theoretical articles saying that the arrival of foreign - funded banks will lead to domestic banks suffering a massive loss of trained personnel because of the wage and benefit issue .
Of course , there are many areas in which I am also dissatisfied naturally with the service of domestic banks .
Regarding salaries at the domestic banks , I also know a thing or two .
But using foreign - funded banks to scare people has absolutely no meaning with regard to solving the problem .
The first thing that has to be clarified is that foreign - funded banks do not act selflessly and go out of their way to help others .
They have a threshold .
Judging from the present , they only serve the wealthy portion of the population , so the majority of those who are enthusiastically waiting in anticipation will probably be disappointed .
So you feel that the line to deposit money in a domestic bank is long and you want to transfer to a foreign - funded bank ?
Without several <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred thousand</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</ENAMEX> , even if you want to become somebody else 's client , they wo n't want you .
As for the outflow of trained personnel , most employees of domestic banks have been stirred into an frenzy by the media and can hardly sit still as they wait for the day they will be enlisted .
However , it 's being said that these people want to train their own employees and the first to be hired will be fresh university graduates .
The people who have worked in domestic banks so long will not be in the ranks of those welcomed unless they are extremely specific high - level personnel with customer resources .
