Yet another political scandal is racking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
But this time it 's hurting opposition as well as ruling - party members .
And as it unfolds , it 's revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> society .
Already , ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Liberal Democratic Party</ENAMEX> demands that opposition members testify under oath in parliament have stalled <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - day</ENAMEX> investigation at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</ENAMEX> .
But the scandal itself is so convoluted that ruling - party members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of undermining the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone .
`` The opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> is that kind of beast , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shigezo Hayasaka</ENAMEX> , former aide to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> kingmaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kakuei Tanaka</ENAMEX> and now an independent analyst .
But , he adds , `` We ca n't tell where it will go at all because we 're still in the middle of it . ''
This time , the scandal centers on donations made by the not - quite - mainstream pachinko parlor industry .
Pachinko , a kind of pinball , is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's favorite form of legal gambling .
The donations so far appear to be small , especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Recruit Co .</ENAMEX> influence - peddling scandal that plagued the ruling party <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
But the implications could be great .
Pachinko is slightly on the shady side , often linked to the lower ranks of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's underworld and regularly at the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> lists of tax evaders .
Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions , and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe .
Also , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 60 %</ENAMEX> of pachinko parlor owners are <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Korean</ENAMEX> , many of whom maintain close ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">North or South Korean</ENAMEX> residents ' organizations , and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
To many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> , pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory .
Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country .
Devotees pass <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</ENAMEX> , watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping , as much to gamble as to get a little time to be anonymous , alone with their thoughts .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">500 yen</ENAMEX> -LRB- $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.60</ENAMEX> -RRB- for a handful of balls , pachinko is a common pastime , and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> .
But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> income of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">13 trillion yen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 92 billion</ENAMEX> -RRB- , or nearly the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's vaunted automobile industry .
And because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> lists for tax evasion , some observers estimate the real income could be <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as 20 trillion yen</ENAMEX> .
If that money were being taxed , it could bring the government a badly needed <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">several trillion yen</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> , an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions .
Then , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament .
The proposal split the industry in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> , along the lines of national origin : <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">North Koreans</ENAMEX> oppose the plan while <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South Koreans</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> accept it or are neutral .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , a conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Japan Socialist Party</ENAMEX> members .
The magazine alleged that in making the donations , the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards , or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">JSP</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">North Korean</ENAMEX> residents ' organization , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chosen Soren</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Chosen Soren</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">JSP</ENAMEX> immediately denied the report .
And at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> , neither the opposition nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> wanted to pursue the issue .
But the press kept it alive ; as with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Recruit</ENAMEX> scandal , lists began circulating with names of people who had received money .
Within a matter of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</ENAMEX> , less - conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations .
So far , though , there have been no allegations that the contributions the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> members received amounted to bribes .
Then the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> camps upped the ante : Reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chosen Soren</ENAMEX> had donated directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">JSP</ENAMEX> members were rapidly countered by statements that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South Korean</ENAMEX> residents ' organization had long been donating directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> members .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">JSP</ENAMEX> admitted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 13</ENAMEX> that its members received <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about eight million yen</ENAMEX> from the pachinko organization , and charged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> members with receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">125 million yen</ENAMEX> -LRB- $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">880,000</ENAMEX> -RRB- and other opposition parties with taking <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 2.5 million yen</ENAMEX> .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , the chief cabinet secretary announced that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> cabinet ministers had received <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">five million yen</ENAMEX> from the industry , including <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">450,000 yen</ENAMEX> -LRB- $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,175</ENAMEX> -RRB- by Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toshiki Kaifu</ENAMEX> .
No one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal .
Direct donations from either of the residents ' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign , but both groups deny making direct donations .
They say it s possible some of their members may be donating privately .
The issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Korean</ENAMEX> residents , those residents were largely born and raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and many speak only <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Japanese</ENAMEX> .
That they retain <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Korean</ENAMEX> citizenship and ties is a reflection of history -- their parents were shipped in as laborers during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the decades</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> -- and the discrimination that still faces <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Koreans</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> society .
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> think it only natural that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians , the way many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> do , to win favor or support .
Both residents ' organizations admit to receiving some funding from abroad .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LDP</ENAMEX> members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">JSP</ENAMEX> 's alleged donations , implying that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">North Korean</ENAMEX> money would be more suspect than <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">South Korean</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> is communist and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> is an ally .
