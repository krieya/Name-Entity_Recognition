The inverse trading relationship between bonds and stocks was interrupted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> as bonds fell despite a modest decline in stock prices .
But bond investors continue to keep a close watch on the jittery stock market .
In early trading , investors were bidding bond prices higher as stocks tumbled and fears mounted that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's stock market debacle would be repeated .
But a partial recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which had been down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 60</ENAMEX> points in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">midmorning</ENAMEX> , dashed those expectations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds also were hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late in the day</ENAMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</ENAMEX> offering by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Tennessee Valley Authority</ENAMEX> and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt .
`` Bond investors were hoping that stock prices would continue to fall , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Early</ENAMEX> , a vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federated Investors Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> .
`` When stocks stabilized , that was a disappointment . ''
Meanwhile , for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the second straight day</ENAMEX> , the bond market paid little attention to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve 's</ENAMEX> open market operations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> officials injected more cash into the banking system by arranging <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</ENAMEX> of repurchase agreements during the usual <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">pre-noon</ENAMEX> intervention period .
The move was meant to keep a lid on interest rates and to boost investor confidence .
`` The intervention has been friendly , meaning that they really did n't have to do it , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Fiorini Ramirez</ENAMEX> , money - market economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ENAMEX> .
She said a more aggressive move was n't needed .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> also appears reluctant to ease credit conditions further .
It already has allowed the closely watched federal funds rate to decline <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/4</ENAMEX> percentage point to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 3/4 %</ENAMEX> from its previous target level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9 %</ENAMEX> .
The rate , which banks charge each other on <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</ENAMEX> loans , is considered an early signal of changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> policy .
It ended at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 11/16 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , but was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as low as 8 1/2 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1/2</ENAMEX> point , or <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $ 5</ENAMEX> for each $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> face amount , while the yield moved above <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> .
Investment - grade corporate , municipal and mortgage - backed securities also fell .
But most junk bonds closed unchanged after opening slightly higher on bargain - hunting by institutional investors .
Some so - called high - quality junk issues , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">R.H. Macy -AMP- Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 1/2 %</ENAMEX> subordinated debentures , rose .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Macy</ENAMEX> 's issue closed up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</ENAMEX> point at a bid price of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVA</ENAMEX> 's public debt offering was its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</ENAMEX> .
Strong investor demand prompted it to boost the size of the issue from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</ENAMEX> .
Traders said hedging related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVA</ENAMEX> pricing also pressured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds .
`` Underwriters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVA</ENAMEX> bonds reduced their market risk by selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasurys</ENAMEX> to cover at least part of their -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVA</ENAMEX> -RCB- holdings , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James R. Capra</ENAMEX> , a senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVA</ENAMEX> bonds also `` served to remind the market that there will be even more new supply , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence N. Leuzzi</ENAMEX> , a managing director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">S.G. Warburg Securities -AMP- Co</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> will announce the size of its next <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> note sale and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Resolution Funding Corp.</ENAMEX> will announce details of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> bond offering .
Some traders estimate <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.75 billion</ENAMEX> of new <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasurys</ENAMEX> will be sold <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> , and they expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Refcorp</ENAMEX> to offer <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion to $ 6 billion</ENAMEX> of long - term `` bailout '' bonds .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Refcorp</ENAMEX> was created to help fund the thrift bailout .
Another agency issue came to market <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Office of Finance</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Home Loan Banks</ENAMEX> said it priced a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - part <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.27 billion</ENAMEX> bond offering for the banks to yield from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.125 % to 8.375 %</ENAMEX> .
The release of several economic reports had little impact on the market , including a report that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade deficit expanded to a surprisingly wide <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.77 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , up from a revised <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.24 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> gap was expected to have expanded to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.1 billion</ENAMEX> .

The benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond was quoted late at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 28/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.04 %</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101 19/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.97 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
The latest <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> notes were quoted late at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 25/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.01 %</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 1/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.97 %</ENAMEX> .

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVA</ENAMEX> 's huge <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</ENAMEX> offering dominated attention in the new - issue market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVA</ENAMEX> offered <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bonds priced to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.06 %</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> notes priced to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.42 %</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year</ENAMEX> notes priced to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.33 %</ENAMEX> .

Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lockheed Corp.</ENAMEX> priced a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 million</ENAMEX> note offering to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.39 %</ENAMEX> .
Mortgage - Backed Securities
The derivative mortgage - backed market revived after a brief hiatus as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> new Remics totaling <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 850 million</ENAMEX> were offered and talk circulated <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two</ENAMEX> more issues that could be priced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
The revival of the real estate mortgage investment conduit market reflected the relative calm in the mortgage market after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</ENAMEX> of volatile trading .
Dealers noted that it 's difficult to structure new Remics when prices are moving widely .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> Remics priced were a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ENAMEX> issue underwritten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> deal underwritten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Greenwich Capital Markets</ENAMEX> .
The Remic issuance supported prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> securities , which held up better than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Government National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> securities during an <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</ENAMEX> sell - off .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> securities for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> delivery ended at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97 29/32</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7/32</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 1/2 %</ENAMEX> securities at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 31/32</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6/32</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> securities at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101 29/32</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5/32</ENAMEX> .

Municipals
Confusion over the near - term trend for rates dominated the municipal arena , as gyrations in the stock market continued to buffet bonds .
Long tax - exempt dollar bonds were mostly flat to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/8</ENAMEX> point lower after a whipsaw session of moving inversely to stocks in modest dealer - led trading .
Prices of pre-refunded municipal bonds were capped by news that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> , as agent for a customer , will accept bids <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> large lists of bonds that include many such issues .
