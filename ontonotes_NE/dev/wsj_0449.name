Wall Street continued to buckle under the public outcry against computer - driven program trading .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder , Peabody -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> , announced it would stop doing stock - index arbitrage for its own account , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> pulled out of the practice altogether .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , which has been buffeted by complaints from angry individual investors and the exchange 's own listed companies , Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Phelan Jr.</ENAMEX> held an emergency meeting with senior partners of some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</ENAMEX> stock specialist firms .
The specialists , a trader said , were `` livid '' about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> 's recent remarks that sophisticated computer - driven trading strategies are `` here to stay . ''
Many investors blame program trading for wild swings in the stock market , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</ENAMEX> - point plunge in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 13</ENAMEX> .
A specialist is an exchange member designated to maintain a fair and orderly market in a specified stock .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> 's meeting with the floor brokers comes as he prepares to explain the exchange 's position on program trading to key congressional regulators in a closed session tomorrow , according to exchange officials .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> spokesman would only say , `` We 're working the problem and looking at the issue and meeting with a broad number of customers and constituents to get their views and ideas on the issue . ''
The program - trading outcry was taken to a new level when giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Contel Corp.</ENAMEX> said it and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 or more</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board 's</ENAMEX> listed companies are forming an unprecedented alliance to complain about the exchange 's role in program trading .
The decision by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill</ENAMEX> , the nation 's largest securities firm , represents the biggest retreat yet from program trading .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill</ENAMEX> has been the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> - biggest stock - index arbitrage trader on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> this year , executing an average of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.1 million</ENAMEX> shares <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</ENAMEX> in such trades , or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one million</ENAMEX> shares a day .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill</ENAMEX> 's move is one of the most sweeping program - trading pullbacks of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent days</ENAMEX> , because the big securities firm will no longer execute stock - index arbitrage trades for customers .
Most Wall Street firms , in pulling back , have merely stopped such trading for their own accounts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill</ENAMEX> has been one of the main firms executing index arbitrage for customers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill</ENAMEX> also said it is lobbying for significant regulatory controls on program trading , including tough margin -- or down - payment -- requirements and limits on price moves for program - driven financial futures .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill</ENAMEX> , in a statement by Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William A. Schreyer</ENAMEX> and President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel P. Tully</ENAMEX> , said index arbitrage `` has been clearly identified in the investing public 's mind as a contributing factor to excess market volatility , '' so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill</ENAMEX> wo n't execute such trades until `` effective controls '' are in place .
In stock - index arbitrage , traders buy and sell large amounts of stocks with offsetting trades in stock - index futures and options .
The idea is to lock in profits from short - term swings in volatile markets .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last Thursday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber Group Inc.</ENAMEX> also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether , but the firm was n't as big an index arbitrager as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill</ENAMEX> is .
Other large firms , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bear , Stearns -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Morgan Stanley -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> announced a pullback from index arbitrage , but only for the firms ' own accounts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder</ENAMEX> made an abrupt about - face on program trading <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , after a special meeting between the firm 's president and chief executive officer , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Carpenter</ENAMEX> , and its senior managers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Just a week ago</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> staunchly defended index arbitrage at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder</ENAMEX> , the most active index - arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
Index arbitrage , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> , does n't have a `` negative impact on the market as a whole '' and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's customers were `` sophisticated '' enough to know that .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> said big institutional investors , which he would n't identify , `` told us they would n't do business with firms '' that continued to do index arbitrage for their own accounts .
`` We were following the trend of our competitors who were under pressure from institutions , '' he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder</ENAMEX> so far this year has executed a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> average of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37.8 million</ENAMEX> shares in index - arbitrage trading , and is second only to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> in overall program trading , which includes index arbitrage .
Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's program trading is for its own account , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder</ENAMEX> denied that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> 's chairman and chief executive , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. Welch</ENAMEX> , had anything to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's decision .
But at least one chief executive said he called Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX> to complain about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's aggressive use of program trading , and other market sources said they understood that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX> received many phone calls complaining about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's reliance on index arbitrage as a major business .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder</ENAMEX> has generally been sensitive to suggestions that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> makes decisions for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder</ENAMEX> unit .
`` Our decision had nothing to do with any pressure Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX> received , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> said .
`` This was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> stand - alone decision . ''
A spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairfield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , said , `` Absolutely no one spoke to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Welch</ENAMEX> on this subject '' and added , `` Anyone who claims they talked to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Welch</ENAMEX> is n't telling the truth . ''
Supporters of index arbitrage have n't been publicly sticking up for the trading strategy , as some did during the post-crash outcry of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> , in its statement about pulling out of index arbitrage , suggested that the current debate has missed the mark .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill</ENAMEX> said it continues to believe that `` the causes of excess market volatility are far more complex than any particular computer trading strategy .
Indeed , there are legitimate hedging strategies used by managers of large portfolios such as pension funds that involve program trading as a means of protecting the assets of their pension beneficiaries . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill</ENAMEX> 's index arbitragers will continue to do other kinds of computer - assisted program trading , so there probably wo n't be any layoffs at the firm , people familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill</ENAMEX> 's program operation said .
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> Chairman and Chief Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan C. Greenberg</ENAMEX> said his firm will continue stock - index arbitrage for its clients .
At the firm 's annual meeting last night , he told shareholders that index arbitrage wo n't go away , despite the public outcry .
`` If they think they are going to stop index arbitrage by causing a few Wall Street firms to quit , they are crazy , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> said .
`` It 's not going to stop it at all . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> , noting that stock - index arbitrage rises and ebbs with stock market 's volatility , said that for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</ENAMEX> of the firm 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year</ENAMEX> beginning in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> , stock - index arbitrage had been a `` break - even '' proposition for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> .
In response to a shareholder 's suggestion , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> agreed that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> firms will simply pick up the index - arbitrage business left behind by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> institutions .
Pressure from big institutional investors has been the major catalyst for Wall Street 's program - trading pullback .
And there was speculation <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fidelity Investments</ENAMEX> and other large mutual - fund companies might soon follow the lead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kemper Corp.</ENAMEX> and other institutions in cutting off trading business to securities firms that do program trading .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fidelity</ENAMEX> spokesman in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> denied the speculation , saying the program - trading issue was more of a regulatory problem .
But a much smaller mutual fund company , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USAA Investment Management Co.</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USAA</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> , said it informed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</ENAMEX> national brokerage firms it will cease business with them unless they stop index - arbitrage trading .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USAA</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400,000</ENAMEX> mutual fund accounts , manages more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</ENAMEX> of which is in the stock market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael J.C. Roth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USAA</ENAMEX> executive vice president , called program trading `` mindless . ''
He said there is `` no valid investment reason '' for stock - index futures to exist .
A program - bashing move is clearly on .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Wohlstetter</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Contel</ENAMEX> , who is helping organize the alliance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> - listed firms , said he had no time to work <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> because he received so many phone calls , faxes and letters supporting his view that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> has been turned into a `` gambling casino '' by program traders .
`` We are reaching the moment of truth '' on Wall Street , said Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward J. Markey</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> subcommittee on telecommunications and finance .
`` -LCB- Wall Street -RCB- is beginning to realize -- as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> said -- the trouble is not in our stars , but in ourselves . ''
