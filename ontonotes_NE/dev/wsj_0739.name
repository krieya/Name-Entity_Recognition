A potentially safer whooping cough vaccine made by novel genetic engineering techniques was described by a team of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Italian</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> scientists .
The team reported they managed to induce bacteria to produce a non-toxic version of the poisons produced by the bacterium that causes whooping cough .
Laboratory tests showed that non-toxic versions of the poisons are capable of inducing an immunity to whooping cough , the researchers reported in this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> 's issue of the journal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Science</ENAMEX> .
The current vaccine for whooping cough , or pertussis , is part of the `` DPT '' -LRB- for diphtheria , pertussis , tetanus -RRB- shot given most infants and young children .
The vaccine is effective in preventing a disease that still afflicts <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 60 million</ENAMEX> children a year world - wide , causing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated one million</ENAMEX> deaths .
The vaccine , however , causes allergic reactions that can be fatal .
The reactions stem from the fact that the vaccine contains multiple copies of the whole Bordetella pertussis bacterium , which causes whooping cough .
This bacterium produces a toxin that , if used as a vaccine , can induce immunity to whooping cough .
Unfortunately , the toxin is also poisonous .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Italian</ENAMEX> - led scientific team said they had succeeded in getting bacteria to produce a non-toxic version of the pertussis toxin , which could be used as a safe vaccine .
The researchers reported they have been able to pluck the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> genes that produced the toxin out of the pertussis bacterium .
It turned out that although it took <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</ENAMEX> genes to produce the toxin , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</ENAMEX> was responsible for the toxin 's virulence .
Ordinarily in genetic engineering each of these genes , minus the one that caused the virulence , would have been transferred to another bacterium , called E. coli , which would then produce a nonvirulent version of the toxin .
The researchers said they did this , but the toxin did n't induce immunity to whooping cough .
The scientists then took the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> toxin genes and triggered a mutation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> gene that caused virulence .
Then , using a new technique -LRB- called homologous recombination -RRB- for introducing genes into cells , they transferred <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</ENAMEX> genes to bacteria closely related to the pertussis organism .
These bacterial `` cousins '' ordinarily do n't make the toxin .
But the genes were accompanied by a piece of DNA , called a promoter , that turns the genes on .
The new bacteria recipients of the genes began producing pertussis toxin which , because of the mutant virulence gene , was no longer toxic .
Experiments showed that the new , non-virulent toxin is capable of inducing immunity , according to the researchers from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Selavo Research Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Siena</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Medical College of Wisconsin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milwaukee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Japanese National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> .
