The amount of the settlement will be taken as a charge against earnings in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth quarter</ENAMEX> .
The settlement , which involves most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</ENAMEX> independent newspaper dealers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> area , will allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Times</ENAMEX> to freely operate its own direct home delivery system .
Home delivery is the fastest growing segment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Times</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1 million</ENAMEX> daily circulation .
