Now `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Truth Squad</ENAMEX> , '' a reality check on the candidates .
In all our polling , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> have rated education as the number <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> issue in this election .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</ENAMEX> , the federal government is spending <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 123 billion</ENAMEX> on education .
That 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 60 billion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than ten years ago</ENAMEX> .
That 's still a small fraction of the total spent .
Nonetheless , many of the other schools are in trouble .
So what would <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> do to fix them ?
Are their plans realistic ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Myers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">`` The Truth Squad ''</ENAMEX> with some answers <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> , `` in depth . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> on the problem of education in this country --
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> today is in the midst of an education recession that can threaten our very future .
A recession ?
Experts say that term 's an exaggeration .
It 's true that the gap in test scores between white and minority students has grown , but experts say overall student performance has not declined .
To say there 's been a recession implies that scores are going down , and there are n't any test scores going down .
At worst , they 've been flat .
At worst , they 've been flat .
Both candidates have a laundry list of proposals to improve education .
At the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> 's -- a tax break to help families pay for college .
I want to give new choices to parents to send their kids to college with a $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000</ENAMEX> tax deduction for college tuition , per child , per year .
Experts say this is less generous than it sounds .
First , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> 's deduction is limited to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000</ENAMEX> per family , not per child , as he said .
What 's more , his plan merely would modestly expand an existing tuition credit .
The bottom line for your family ?
The most that this credit could give any family is $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">800</ENAMEX> more than what they get under present law .
Another key issue this year -- how to deal with failing public schools .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's solutions -- double the number of independent , publicly funded schools , known as charter schools .
We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools .
We 've got a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> .
But experts say the early record of charter schools in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> is not as strong as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> claims .
Some schools , like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KIPP Academy</ENAMEX> , are said to be doing a great job with economically disadvantaged students , but a report finds that charter schools overall in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> have more students per teacher , less experienced teachers and lower test scores .
It 's a mixed picture .
Charter schools are having some successes and some struggles .
But overall , students in charter schools have lower performance scores than students in traditional public schools .
So how would Gore deal with failing public schools ?
If it 's a failing school , shut it down , and reopen it under a new principal , with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Hunt</ENAMEX> does in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> .
But Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> 's office says no school has been shut down yet in his state .
So experts say it 's too soon to tell if it works , and some call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> 's plan an empty promise .
Why ?
Because they say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> does not require the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> student testing needed to tell whether a school is failing or not .
There 's simply not as much there as Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> is pretending that there is .
It 's really more rhetoric than substance .
Most misleading of all , experts say , is each candidate 's claim that his plan can dramatically improve public education .
Because federal money accounts for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 7 %</ENAMEX> of school funding , experts say any President can help only at the margins .
