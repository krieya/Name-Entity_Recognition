The nation 's largest pension fund , which oversees <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80 billion</ENAMEX> for college employees , plans to offer <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> new investment options to its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2 million</ENAMEX> participants .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association - College Retirement Equities Fund</ENAMEX> said it will introduce a stock and bond fund that will invest in `` socially responsible '' companies , and a bond fund .
Both funds are expected to begin operation around <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1</ENAMEX> , subject to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> approval .
For its employees to sign up for the options , a college also must approve the plan .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 4,300</ENAMEX> institutions are part of the pension fund .
The new options carry out part of an agreement that the pension fund , under pressure to relax its strict participation rules and to provide more investment options , reached with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> .
The new `` social choice '' fund will shun securities of companies linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> , nuclear power and in some cases , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern Ireland</ENAMEX> .
Also excluded will be investments in companies with `` significant '' business stemming from weapons manufacture , alcoholic beverages or tobacco .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Sixty percent</ENAMEX> of the fund will be invested in stocks , with the rest going into bonds or short - term investments .
The bond fund will invest in high - grade or medium - grade bonds , mortgages or asset - backed securities , including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 15 %</ENAMEX> in foreign securities .
The fund also might buy and sell futures and options contracts , subject to approval by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York State Insurance Department</ENAMEX> .
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> new features , participants will be able to transfer money from the new funds to other investment funds or , if their jobs are terminated , receive cash from the funds .
The investment choices offered by the pension fund currently are limited to a stock fund , an annuity and a money - market fund .
