The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 25</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tracking Travel</ENAMEX> '' column advises readers to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Charge With Caution When Traveling Abroad</ENAMEX> '' because credit - card companies charge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</ENAMEX> to convert foreign - currency expenditures into dollars .
In fact , this is the best bargain available to someone traveling abroad .
In contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</ENAMEX> conversion fee charged by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Visa</ENAMEX> , foreign - currency dealers routinely charge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</ENAMEX> or more to convert <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollars into foreign currency .
On top of this , the traveler who converts his dollars into foreign currency before the trip starts will lose interest from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> of conversion .
At the end of the trip , any unspent foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars , with another commission due .
The card holder will pay the modest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</ENAMEX> fee only on the amounts actually needed .
Typically , he will be billed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only several weeks</ENAMEX> after the expenditure , and then has <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">another couple of weeks</ENAMEX> before he has to pay the bill .
In the meantime , the money can continue to earn interest for the card holder -- often more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</ENAMEX> during that `` float '' period alone .
