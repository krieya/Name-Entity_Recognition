This has been <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</ENAMEX> of stunning events behind what was once called the Iron Curtain and interesting shifts in official <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> policy toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> .
It has also been <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</ENAMEX> when inside - the - beltway <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> has had a high old time gnawing over ex-President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">multimillion - dollar</ENAMEX> junket in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
The latter may seem oddly irrelevant , if not downright trivial , given the big picture and the way we have handled it in the nation 's capital has done nothing to dispel that impression .
In fact , however , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> 's casual debasement of the office he so recently held raises issues about which <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> can actually do something .
Our ability to influence the outcome of events in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> is far more marginal .
Those events continue to move at a rate , and in a direction , which leave informed commentary -- let alone policy -- far in their wake .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard A. Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> confessed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> ignored universal human values by invading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and , to put it bluntly , `` engaged in a violation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the ABM Treaty</ENAMEX> '' by building its radar station at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> is no longer a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Socialist Peoples</ENAMEX> '' republic , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Communist Party</ENAMEX> no longer has automatic delegates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress of Peoples Deputies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Egon Krenz</ENAMEX> was not backed unanimously by his fellow party functionaries when he took over as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany 's</ENAMEX> new maximum leader .
All of that is just for starters , or so the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Eastern Europeans</ENAMEX> in the streets seem to hope and are certainly demanding .
Of like , though lesser , note , Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX> put the administration <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - square behind perestroika and glasnost , and therefore behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> , in a pair of carefully reasoned speeches over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past week</ENAMEX> or so .
And , last but not least , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> now views the changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> as `` absolutely extraordinary '' and believes that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> `` ca n't turn the clock back '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX> because the change is too inexorable , '' as he told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Times 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.W. Apple Jr</ENAMEX> .
-LRB- In other words , after some highly visible dithering and public airing of differences , the administration has come down on the side of those who believe that what we are witnessing from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Siberia</ENAMEX> is a good thing to be welcomed , rather than a new thing to be feared or viewed with suspicion . -RRB-
All of this is what history will note , assuming that events do n't make it seem a bad joke , when the record of this time is put down .
For journalists , however , who write what they fondly view as history 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> draft , this has also been <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</ENAMEX> to give a lot of space and time to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX> 's sales appearance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> on behalf of a communications giant and its controversial founder .
It has been a well - paid transaction , this bartering away of the prestige of the republic 's highest office .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> industrialist has coughed up <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 2 million</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> government has put up just about as much , or so it is reported and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</ENAMEX> estimate puts the total tab at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 million</ENAMEX> .
All of which has enabled those of us in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> who enjoy wallowing in such things to go into high public dudgeon , as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apple</ENAMEX> and I did <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the other night</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nightline</ENAMEX> . ''
Punching away , we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</ENAMEX> hard blow , but at the end of the affair , there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of his defenders so aptly put it , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> was simply doing what he had always done before his election -LRB- and some would say thereafter as well -RRB- .
He was performing for pay , and why should anyone expect anything more ?
Primarily because there 's more to the matter than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan 's</ENAMEX> personal values , or lack of them .
Selling the presidency for a mess of pottage is not so much a devaluation from the norm of public life <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> as it is a reflection of the disintegration of public standards .
The theme song for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</ENAMEX> has been , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Anything Goes</ENAMEX> , '' and it has been whistled with gusto from Wall Street to some of the highest peaks of televangelism .
There are those who say that this is nothing new , that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> has always suffered from a bad case of schizophrenia when it comes to the dichotomy between what is professed and what is practiced .
There is evidence to support that view .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Eighty - three years ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William James</ENAMEX> wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.G. Wells</ENAMEX> : `` The moral flabbiness born of the exclusive worship of the bitch goddess success ... that , with the squalid cash interpretation put on the word success , is our national disease . ''
But if it was the national disease in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1906</ENAMEX> , it is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> the national commonplace .
If there is no law against it , do it .
If the law leaves loopholes , use them .
If there is no moral prohibition that expressly forbids it , full speed ahead .
And if you are caught or if people complain , simply argue that `` everyone does it '' or `` no one said I should n't '' and brazen it out .
As a last recourse , when all else has failed and you are pinned , apologize for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong .
-LRB- See , for instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Bakker 's</ENAMEX> remarks upon being sentenced to prison <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this Tuesday</ENAMEX> for defrauding the faithful . -RRB-
Consider the troubling dissonance between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> 's speech of confession <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> and the hang - tough defense of everyone concerned with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> - Contra affair .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> foreign minister publicly concedes that his government `` violated norms of behavior '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and just plain lied about the radar station .
We have people in high place still lying through their teeth about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> - Contra , and that apparently is n't going to change .
For that matter , those <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">long ago</ENAMEX> identified as liars are still given respectful hearings in the press .
That is the key to the current `` national disease . ''
No one seems willing to hold anyone in public life to a standard higher than the narrowest construction of the law .
The occasional media witch hunt about some politician 's private peccadilloes notwithstanding , the general inclination is to offer a version of the old refrain , `` Who am I to judge ? ''
Thus , no standards , no judgment and no values .
`` You are mad because he 's making so much money , '' say President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> 's defenders .
No , we ought to be mad because he has demeaned the office we gave him , enlisting it in the service of private gain , just as we ought to be mad that public officials lie through their teeth , play disingenuous games about their activities or , to steal a phrase , make public service a private trough .
`` I 'm not going to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apple</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> 's interview .
He was referring to the `` absolutely extraordinary '' events in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> , and it is a defensible position .
But there is no defense at all for the ethos of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</ENAMEX> .
We did n't stampede into it , we slithered and slipped down the long slope , and now we have as its quintessential symbol a former president huckstering for a foreign poohbah .
Or perhaps that is a fitting symbol for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> : Everything for sale ; nothing of real value .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> is a political commentator who heads a television production firm .
