Looking back at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</ENAMEX> , it can be found that when choosing collaboration partners in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> market , more and more multinational corporations turned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Baidu</ENAMEX> .
Last month it was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">eBay</ENAMEX> , and before that , there was content provider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MTV</ENAMEX> ; IT hardware manufacturer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hewlett - Packard</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> , and mobile phone manufacturer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nokia</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Microsoft</ENAMEX> 's choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Baidu</ENAMEX> this time has yet again strengthened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Baidu</ENAMEX> 's brand name .
Over the past one year , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Baidu</ENAMEX> 's brand name has established a polarization , where the strong becomes even stronger .
Therefore , brand names have become an insurmountable barrier for pursuers .
Multinational corporations ' choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Baidu</ENAMEX> was based on the selections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Baidu</ENAMEX> made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> market as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> netizens .
According to the latest survey data released by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">iResearch</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Baidu</ENAMEX> 's market share has reached <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69 %</ENAMEX> , while the market share of its major competitor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Google</ENAMEX> has slipped to about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
Recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Google</ENAMEX> has raised doubts about the survey data .
It is very possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Google</ENAMEX> is worried about being marginalized .
