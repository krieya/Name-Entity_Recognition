<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guo Kai 's Economic Notes</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> 's Gas Price vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> Gas Price
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guo Kai 's Economic Notes</ENAMEX>
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> the current average price of regular unleaded gas is about <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.3 US dollars</ENAMEX> per gallon <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-LRB- 3.78 liters -RRB-</ENAMEX> .
According to the official exchange rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">one US dollar</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.9 RMB</ENAMEX> , this price is equivalent to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.80 yuan</ENAMEX> / liter .
Note , this gas price includes all taxes .
The current gas price in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.09 yuan</ENAMEX> / liter , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 mao and 9 fen</ENAMEX> more than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> .
In fact , the gas price difference between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> places is larger than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 mao and 9 fen</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's gas price does not include so many taxes as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> ; for example , the highway maintenance fee in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is paid separately .
Just now , I only narrated a fact .
But I believe that different persons see different problems in this fact .
Let me describe people 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> reactions that I can imagine , or the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> problems I can see .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> gas price is too cheap .
In an absolute sense , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> gas price has +already been cheaper than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's , and in a relative sense , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> gas price is even cheaper .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , the money you pay for a meal at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald</ENAMEX> 's can fill up more than <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 liters</ENAMEX> of gas , but in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> you can get <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 - 6 liters</ENAMEX> of gas at most .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> low gas price policy has undoubtedly led to this country 's excessive use of and overdependence on energy resources .
However , there is more to this matter , the whole world has to share the various negative effects caused by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> excessive energy consumption : global warming , and wars caused by oil , etc.
It is totally a joke that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> gas price could be cheaper than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's gas price is too expensive .
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> buy gas from the international market , and the technology and cost of oil refinement are not too much different .
But with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> gas price including taxes even lower than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's gas price excluding taxes , you can see how much money <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> oil companies have made out of this .
If there are no price controls and monopolies , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's gas price should n't have been this high .
I want to say that I think these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> opinions are both correct .
So , on the issue of oil consumption , I think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , the No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> and No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> oil consumers in the world , are also a funny pair .
From a global perspective , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">US</ENAMEX> gas price is obviously too low .
So <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mankiw</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvard</ENAMEX> even formed a " Pigou Club , " gathering social celebrities who support levying higher taxes on gas prices -LRB- hereby raising gas prices -RRB- .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's gas prices are more complicated .
In fact , gas prices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> are probably not very high , but in order to reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's future overdependence on gas , it may be better that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's gas prices are higher .
But , the direct result of the gas price increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> will be the increase of monopoly profits of the monopoly companies .
This part of money will not become the government tax revenue , will not be used for public welfare , and on the contrary , will only make the benefits of those people working at the monopoly department even better .
In other words , the gas price in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is too high in the distributive sense .
It is the price that transfers the entire social resources to a very small number of people .
But in terms of sustainability , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's gas price may still be too low .
We need high gas prices to control the overdependence on energy imports .
Perhaps someone will condemn me , saying further increase of gas prices will make life unbearable for people .
If you are a taxi driver , my reply is : the reason your life is unbearable is not the gas price , but because of our taxi licensing regulation system .
If you are a car owner , my reply is : ride the subway and bus more often .
It saves money , reduces congestion , and also lets you know car owners are not in a position to say " life is unbearable . "
Compared with most people , your life is already quite good .

Comparing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald</ENAMEX> 's in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald</ENAMEX> 's in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> may not be right .
Eating a meal at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald</ENAMEX> 's in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> is more comparable to buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 - yuan</ENAMEX> boxed meal in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
