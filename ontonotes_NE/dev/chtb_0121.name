<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Xinhua News Agency</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 16th</ENAMEX> , by reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ye Yuan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's pharmaceutical enterprises , which mainly produce large amount of medicines used as raw materials and imitate foreign chemical medicines over a long period of time , will accelerate the development of new medicines and technologies with their own intellectual property rights .
An official from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Pharmaceutical Administration Bureau</ENAMEX> said that , starting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , financial aid for the research of innovative medicines will be further increased , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> - owned funds would give investment priority to the fields of high technology and innovated medical products .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Pharmaceutical Administration Bureau</ENAMEX> will evaluate and decide the top <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> enterprises in the pharmaceutical industry according to new criteria .
Total annual sales revenue is predicted to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 60 %</ENAMEX> of the whole country 's medicine sales revenue .
At the same time , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 - 5 %</ENAMEX> of each enterprise 's annual sales revenue will be used for the research and development of new medicines .
This official said that , at the same time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> should also guide foreign capital to invest in new technologies , new products and medicine projects in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Midwest</ENAMEX> area , to give impetus to national medicine enterprises to improve products ' technical content and enhance competitiveness in the international market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> now has about <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,500</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical enterprises , which produce <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,350</ENAMEX> kinds of medicines used as raw materials and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</ENAMEX> kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> herbal medicines each year , and is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> largest producing and exporting country of medicines used as raw materials , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> only to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> .
But due to science and technology content being low , the product 's sales price on the international market is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 - 30 %</ENAMEX> lower than the normal price , and can only return more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> in foreign currency each year .
While in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> , importing pharmaceutical preparations alone consumed funds surpassing <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.1 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
Now , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 3,000</ENAMEX> full time personnel engaging in the research of innovated medicines , only corresponding to personnel on the regular payroll of the research department of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merck Pharmaceutical Company</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> .
Experts urge that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's pharmaceutical industry should change methods of focusing on the production of medicines used as raw materials , while paying less attention to development of preparations , and catching up with development trends of the global pharmaceutical industry as soon as possible .
It was learned that , the national project of new medicines and industrialized development , jointly promoted by departments of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Science Commission</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Public Health</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Pharmaceutical Administration Bureau</ENAMEX> , etc. , is now being implemented .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of this century</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</ENAMEX> new patent protected medicines are planned to be developed and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> new medicine selecting centers , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> medication safety assessing centers and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> medication clinic experimentation centers will be built .
