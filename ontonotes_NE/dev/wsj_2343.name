The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronx</ENAMEX> has a wonderful botanical garden , a great zoo , its own charming <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Little Italy</ENAMEX> -LRB- on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Arthur Avenue</ENAMEX> -RRB- and , of course , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yankees</ENAMEX> .
However , most people , having been subjected to news footage of the devastated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Bronx</ENAMEX> , look at the borough the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Wolfe 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman McCoy</ENAMEX> did in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bonfire of the Vanities</ENAMEX> '' -- as a wrong turn into hell .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Cunningham 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronx</ENAMEX> , her childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronx</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">'50s</ENAMEX> , is something else altogether .
In a lovely , novelistic memoir , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sleeping Arrangements</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Knopf</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">195</ENAMEX> pages , $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">18.95</ENAMEX> -RRB- , she remembers an exotic playground , peopled mainly by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> eccentrics and the occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Catholic</ENAMEX> -LRB- real oddballs like her sexpot friend , the hell - kitten <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> , age <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cunningham</ENAMEX> , a novelist and playwright , has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall .
She transforms her `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronx</ENAMEX> of the emotions , a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria '' into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the `` Babylonian Bronx</ENAMEX> , '' a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Babylonian Bronx</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> working - class people lived in drab , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> - style buildings `` glamorized '' with names like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">AnaMor Towers</ENAMEX> -LRB- after owners <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris Snezak</ENAMEX> -RRB- , whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Syrians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Greeks</ENAMEX> , friezes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pompeii</ENAMEX> .
For Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cunningham</ENAMEX> the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she felt living in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the AnaMor Towers</ENAMEX> as a little girl : `` ... outwardly ordinary , inwardly ornate , owing all inspiration to heathen cultures . ''
Sharp - witted and funny but never mean , she 's a memorialist a bit like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truman Capote</ENAMEX> , if he 'd been <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> and female and less bitchy .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Lily</ENAMEX> , as Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cunningham</ENAMEX> calls herself in the book , really was n't ordinary .
She was raised , for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first eight years</ENAMEX> , by her mother , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie</ENAMEX> , whom she remembers as a loving liar , who realigned history to explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily</ENAMEX> 's father did n't live with them .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie</ENAMEX> reinvented this man , who may or may not have known about his child , as a war hero for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily</ENAMEX> 's benefit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie</ENAMEX> died young and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily</ENAMEX> has remembered her as a romantic figure , who did n't interfere much with her child 's education on the streets .
The games <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronx</ENAMEX> children played -LRB- holding kids down and stripping them , for example -RRB- seem tame by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's crack standards , but Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cunningham</ENAMEX> makes it all sound like a great adventure .
`` Without official knowledge of sex or death , we flirted with both , '' she writes .
She analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements .
Her friend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan</ENAMEX> , whose parents kept reminding her she was unwanted , slept on a narrow bed wedged into her parents ' bedroom , as though she were a temporary visitor .
Her friend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> 's father was a professional thief ; they did n't seem to have any bedrooms at all .
Maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily</ENAMEX> became so obsessed with where people slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie</ENAMEX> died , her uncles moved in -- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements .
They painted the apartment orange , pink and white , according to her instructions .
With loving detail she recalls her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Gabe</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Orthodox Jew</ENAMEX> and song lyricist -LRB- who rhymed river with liver in a love song -RRB- ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Len</ENAMEX> , a mysterious part - time investigator who looked like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lincoln</ENAMEX> and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope , like an `` undercover President on a good - will mission . ''
They came by their strangeness honestly .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily</ENAMEX> 's grandmother , no cookie baker , excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album , and lugged around her perennial work - in - progress , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Philosophy for Women</ENAMEX> . ''
The book loses some momentum toward the end , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily</ENAMEX> becomes more preoccupied with dating boys and less with her delightfully weird family .
For the most part , though , there 's much pleasure in her saucy , poignant probe into the mysteries of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Babylonian Bronx</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronx</ENAMEX> also figures in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Jay Friedman 's</ENAMEX> latest novel , which flashes back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the New York</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">'50s</ENAMEX> .
But both the past and present worlds of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Current Climate</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Atlantic Monthly Press</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</ENAMEX> pages , $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">18.95</ENAMEX> -RRB- feel cramped and static .
For his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</ENAMEX> novel , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman</ENAMEX> tried to resuscitate the protagonist of his <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</ENAMEX> work , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">About Harry Towns</ENAMEX> . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX> is now a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">57 - year - old</ENAMEX> writer , whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> seems quaintly out - of - synch .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX> fondly remembers <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the `` old '' days of the early '70s</ENAMEX> , when people like his friend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Travis</ENAMEX> would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Travis</ENAMEX> was doing wrong .
`` An <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> solution , '' explains Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman</ENAMEX> .
Line by line Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman</ENAMEX> 's weary cynicism can be amusing , especially when he 's riffing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> social scheme -- the way people size each other up , immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX> has avoided all that by living in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Long Island</ENAMEX> suburb with his wife , who 's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels she barely seems to notice when her husband disappears for drug - seeking forays into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> .
But it does n't take too many lines to figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX> out .
He 's a bore .
