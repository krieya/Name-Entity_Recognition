" I Can Say My ABCs ! "
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> Instruction Goes " Prime " Time
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teng Sue - feng</ENAMEX> / photos by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh Chi - kuang</ENAMEX> / tr. by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sue Jollow</ENAMEX> -RRB-
Beginning in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> will become a compulsory subject for primary school students in grades <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</ENAMEX> .
In fact , choruses of " bo - po - mo " and " A - B - C " have been recited in primary school classrooms for a long time now .
Many parents begin sending their children to " bilingual " kindergartens , or to private <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> schools long before , hoping to provide them with an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> - speaking environment from an early age to prepare them to compete in modern society .
The whole world seems to be learning <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> .
Is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> getting on the bandwagon too late ?
And what kind of developments have taken place in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language teaching methodology , from private language schools to the education system itself ?
For students in grades <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> , school should finish at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</ENAMEX> , but at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chunghsing Primary School</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Hsimen District</ENAMEX> , the grade <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> students are performing an abridged <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language version of the play " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cinderella</ENAMEX> . "
Their teacher , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shen</ENAMEX> , says the line " My <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Charming</ENAMEX> ! " and the young girl playing the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cinderella</ENAMEX> , repeats it after her word for word .
Then the young boy playing the prince replies " You are beautiful ! "
Their audience of classmates breaks into laughter .
After this , the class plays ' Teacher Says . '
Speaking in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> the teacher tells the children to do various actions :
stand up , sit down , touch your hair , touch your nose ... .
Anyone who gets the action wrong is out .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> lesson , a grade <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</ENAMEX> class at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jen Ai Primary School</ENAMEX> is starting sentences with ' I can . '
The teacher explains the basic pattern then the class begins a game of charades .
Children mime movements at the front of the class : swimming , dancing , jumping , running etc , and their classmates have to use <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> to describe what they 're doing .
Next is story telling time ; today 's story is about a child who just ca n't stop sneezing .
What is he so sensitive to ?
Is it dust ?
a plant ?
perfume ?
pepper ?
the story finishes as the bell sounds to end the lesson .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Forty minutes</ENAMEX> have passed in the blink of an eye .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">4 pm</ENAMEX> students wearing the uniforms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jen Ai</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tunhua</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chien An</ENAMEX> primary schools stream into a private <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> school in a lane off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tunhua South Road</ENAMEX> .
In one classroom <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> students look at phonetic symbols on the blackboard and repeat the words after their teacher in a loud chorus , learning the relationship between the phonetic symbols and the letters .
Putting down roots
Just how widespread is this <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> learning among our primary students ?
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Neihu</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Four years earlier</ENAMEX> his daughter , now in grade <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</ENAMEX> , attended <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> classes at a well known private kindergarten in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Neihu</ENAMEX> .
Every evening just on dusk the kindergarten 's minibus would pick up his daughter and take her away to spend two happy hours each day in a " totally <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> " language environment .
" If your <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is good , it gives you an edge .
It 's essential , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> .
" I grew up in a rural area , and never had an environment like this .
When I made my way into the wider world , I was on the back foot compared to people with good <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> . "
He wants his children to be better prepared for life than he was , so like the children of many of his friends and relatives , they began learning <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in kindergarten .
" As long as we can find the money , at least they wo n't be left behind at the starting line . "
Even though the fees for his <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> children to attend a bilingual kindergarten came to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 80,000</ENAMEX> for just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> term , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> considers it " money well spent . "
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> , a mother living on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Minsheng East Road</ENAMEX> recalls some years ago , before <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> teaching in primary schools started in earnest .
Her daughter , then in grade <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</ENAMEX> , started attending a private <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> school .
She really enjoyed it and she found she was able to listen to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language educational programs on the radio all by herself .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is definitely an international language , and it 's become indispensable for getting by in the world - like being able to use a computer .
You simply ca n't find work without it . "
These days learning <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is part and parcel of a primary student 's life , unlike their parents who first met " A , B , C ... " when they began high school .
Following on research done by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chu Hui - mei</ENAMEX> , head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the English Department</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Taipei Municipal Teachers College</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September , 1997 ,</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei City</ENAMEX> selected <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</ENAMEX> primary schools to pilot a grade <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> program .
Together with schools not participating in this pilot program , by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 1997</ENAMEX> there were already <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112</ENAMEX> primary schools in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei City</ENAMEX> teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</ENAMEX> of the total -RRB- .
That same year , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kaohsiung City</ENAMEX> selected <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</ENAMEX> primary schools to implement a comprehensive <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language program for grades <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</ENAMEX> , while in other areas , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei County</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ilan County</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yunlin County</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bureau of Education</ENAMEX> was giving more urgency to the promotion of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in primary schools .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language teaching in primary schools is a key plank in a range of curriculum reforms to take us into the new century .
As early as <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Educational Reform Committee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Executive Yuan</ENAMEX> proposed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Education</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in the primary school curriculum .
After taking office the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minister for Education</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Ching</ENAMEX> , put forward the idea of a " <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nine - year</ENAMEX> integrated curriculum " encompassing primary and secondary education .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> , the President of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Academia Sinica</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Yuan - tseh</ENAMEX> , indicated to a meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Science and Technology Committee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Executive Yuan</ENAMEX> that because <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> had been taught in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> as a " discipline " rather than as a " communication tool , " <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> who went to study overseas found they were unable to read what their professors had prescribed in the time available .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris Chang</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation</ENAMEX> , echoed these sentiments , pointing out that compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> competency of our high school and tertiary graduates is inadequate for any practical use .
This is affecting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's access to information and acting as a barrier to increasing our productivity .
When he was premier , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Siew</ENAMEX> agreed in principle to introducing <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> instruction in the earlier years of schooling .
Situational ABC
In actual fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> for children was already popular all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> even before these moves .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> associate professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Hsien - ta</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Taiwan University Linguistics Research Institute</ENAMEX> investigated whether or not a " second language " was being taught in public and privately run kindergartens in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei City</ENAMEX> and County , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hsinchu City</ENAMEX> and County , and found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79 %</ENAMEX> were doing so .
In these kindergartens <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> was by far the most popular second language , being taught in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77.5 %</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei City</ENAMEX> the figure was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 %</ENAMEX> .
In the current climate of almost unanimous community support for the expansion of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> teaching into early education , the primary schools of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei City</ENAMEX> with its rich resources , were the first to pilot this , but the investment of the parents has also been crucial .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang Yuan - tai</ENAMEX> , an administrator at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chunghsing Primary School</ENAMEX> gives an example :
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years ago</ENAMEX> a parent who had worked in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> approached the school , saying that at home they often told their children stories in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> , and they wanted the other children to enjoy similar benefits .
The school responded positively and for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next two years</ENAMEX> , gathered students in the middle and elementary grades together in a large group in the school hall each morning in their study hour , and conducted a program .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years ago</ENAMEX> , realizing that the local parents had to work in the daytime , the school began holding supplementary after - school classes offering <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> lessons every Wednesday afternoon for the elementary grades .
" The parents are delighted .
They think it 's far better for their children to be here improving their <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> than sitting at home in front of a TV . "
The current model is very different to how <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> used to be taught in secondary schools , which was " first learn to read and write , then learn to speak . "
English lessons for children emphasize situations , fun , and practice .
" We 're basically creating the same environment for our children as an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> preschooler would have , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shen Hui - lien</ENAMEX> , a teacher at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chunghsing Primary School</ENAMEX> .
On Wednesday afternoons she speaks only <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> with the children .
They must ask " May I go to the bathroom ? "
to get her permission to leave the room when the need arises .
" Children in these earliest grades are soak up everything like a sponge .
This is the ideal time to establish their listening comprehension and pronunciation . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jen Ai Primary School</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 100</ENAMEX> classes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Eight years ago</ENAMEX> it was approached by a parent offering to come to the school to teach the students some <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> songs and tell some <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> stories .
A few years ago , the school began allowing grades <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</ENAMEX> to turn on the TV sets in their classrooms every morning <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">between 8:00 and 8:15</ENAMEX> , and watch simple <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> dialogue videos produced by their teachers .
Big classes , little practice
What strikes people as curious is , if their schools have had <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> classes for a long time now then why do so many students need to go to private language schools ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Chien - hao</ENAMEX> , another teacher at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jen Ai Primary School</ENAMEX> , says that at least <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two - thirds</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 600</ENAMEX> students are getting extra <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> lessons outside school .
" If they were n't doing this extra work , they 'd never be able to keep up after entering junior high school . "
According to Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Su</ENAMEX> , a mother living in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Tanshui</ENAMEX> , many junior high schools include <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> listening comprehension tests in the entrance examinations and if primary school students do n't improve their skills then they simply wo n't make the grade .
In her family the problem is that her son began learning <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> when he was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four</ENAMEX> , and so when he went to primary school , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> lessons were just too simple for him .
And you really need small class sizes for the training of listening comprehension , and this is another thing the schools can not provide .
So the only thing to do is keep on sending him to the private language school , where classes are more ideally sized .
Another mother , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> , who lives on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chunghsiao East Road</ENAMEX> , recalls what happened <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> when her son 's school began teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> .
From the very beginning the teacher only spoke <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and her son suffered a lot of setbacks .
" He just could n't understand a thing his teacher was saying , and he asked if he could go to a private <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> school . "
She could n't see any other choice and agreed to let him enroll at one nearby .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Taipei City Government Bureau of Education</ENAMEX> invited experts to form a working team to visit primary schools and inspect their <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> instruction programs .
It found that for the majority of teachers , the greatest difficulty is the vast range of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> levels of the students in a single class .
Some have been learning <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> since very young and find class too easy , and so when the lesson starts their enthusiasm evaporates .
For other students meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time , however , the lessons are hard going .
Added to this is the perennial problem of class sizes being too large , and not enough <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> classes scheduled - only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> .
It 's extremely difficult to correct pronunciation problems , or to achieve any educational goals at all , under these conditions .
The parents have a number of concerns .
If the teachers only speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in class it will frighten children who have never learnt <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> before .
Some teachers teach too quickly and some of their students ca n't keep up , so all parents can do is send their kids to private language schools .
Singing and jumping around are not really suitable for the senior grades , and parents hope that teachers will keep in mind the different needs of different age groups .
Parents and teachers both raised the idea of " ability streaming , " i.e. , different classes for different ability levels , to address the difficulties of large classes .
Educators , however , have many reservations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chu Hui - mei</ENAMEX> explains , " Every <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> family is preoccupied with being able to get ahead in the world , but our past experience with ability - based class groupings has taught us some bitter lessons . "
When students are grouped on the basis of ability , some parents get upset when their children are placed in a lower level group , which makes them lose face .
It can also affect the children 's confidence .
" We have large numbers of students .
People need to think about what resources the schools have , and whether they could help in some way . "
She suggests that schools can organize <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> Clubs for the more advanced students , and their teachers can provide them with interesting story books which are more demanding .
This way , they 'll feel that the teacher is giving them some attention , and that their needs are also being catered for .
" Private language schools fill a need for small - group learning . "
Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Hsien - ta</ENAMEX> recommends that teachers use " co-operative learning " methods .
For example , divide a large class into groups to discuss what they would buy with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 100</ENAMEX> .
The more advanced students can lead the discussion , which gives them a sense of participation .
But this kind of activity may not succeed the first few times - it takes time to get used to group learning .
With regard to the problems of having too few classes a week and learning very little <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> , the working group suggested that schools could take advantage of times such as early - morning study hour , cleaning time , and the lunch break to play tapes or practise speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> , to give students more exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> .
Fewer foreign teachers
In the past , <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> teaching placed too much emphasis on reading and writing , whereas now for most primary school students , " learning to understand and speak is foremost , reading and writing is secondary . "
Nevertheless many people have reservations about the pronunciation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> teachers in our primary schools .
Private language schools also seem aware of this , and many prominently advertise the fact that they employ foreign teachers .
But do the foreign teachers really teach more effectively than our local teachers ?
" Many people put the root of the problems they had learning <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> down to not being able to speak . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chu Hui - mei</ENAMEX> says that while there are differences it 's difficult to say whether foreign or local teachers are better .
Native speakers of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> " may not understand what it 's like for someone learning <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as a foreign language and the kinds of problems they face . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chu Hui - mei</ENAMEX> took part in the inspection visits to primary schools , and foung that local teachers understand the children 's way of thinking and have a much better grasp of the course .
Foreign teachers ' strengths lie in dialogue and accurate pronunciation .
Besides , " We ca n't put the whole responsibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language teaching onto foreign teachers . "
Several years ago when there was a shortage of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> teachers in the primary schools , many schools employed foreign teachers on an hourly basis , or made staff sharing arrangements with private language schools .
But these were stopgap measures .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Ministry of Education</ENAMEX> has already drawn up a whole range of plans for teacher training .
These include establishing <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> Teaching Departments at teacher training colleges and supplementary education courses at tertiary institutions , allowing graduates who intend to become <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> teachers in primary schools to obtain official teaching qualifications , and providing further training for qualified teachers who have never taught <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> , to equip them with appropriate language teaching skills and methods .
The primary school <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> train has already left the station .
What can we look forward to ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yutsai Primary School</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei County</ENAMEX> did a survey of how parents felt about the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> teaching program .
It found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52 %</ENAMEX> thought that the goal was to stimulate the students ' interest in learning <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 %</ENAMEX> thought it was to establish a solid grounding in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> for the children while they were still young .
Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Hsien - ta</ENAMEX> says that given the expansion of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> teaching into the primary schools , we can not allow a great gap to open between what 's happening in the primary and the secondary schools .
Primary schools include a lot of games and activities in their <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> teaching , and while this is very lively , if all it amounts to is a lot of jumping around and loud pronunciation practice , the children may get a quite incorrect idea of what <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is all about .
When the day comes that they go to high school , and they have to settle down and read an essay , they could well find that really boring .
" Listening , speaking , reading and writing all have their place .
None should be overemphasized at the expense of the others . "
" The way children learn <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> now wo n't be the same as it was for us .
Resources have improved tremendously , and how things are done has changed along with the environment .
The younger the students , the more essential it is to pay very serious attention to course standards , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chu Hui - mei</ENAMEX> .
The current educational mantra is " student centered learning , " and the teacher 's role is extremely important .
According to her understanding , more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</ENAMEX> of the primary school teachers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei City</ENAMEX> are outstanding .
" What we envisage as a reasonable target is for the children to learn to hear and understand - and be able to say - <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</ENAMEX> words after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> . "
She wants the children to understand how to use the words , to be willing to use them , and to use them whenever the opportunity arises .
She also hopes that they will get a lot of pleasure from reading <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> storybooks .
" The primary <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> program is not a subject like mathematics or <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> .
It 's something new and it 's still finding its place in the curriculum , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Chien - hao</ENAMEX> , from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jen Ai Primary School</ENAMEX> .
As he sees it , the children must not feel that learning <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is putting them under a lot of pressure .
If they can see a word and read it aloud , that 's fine .
They can leave memorizing word lists until they get to high school .
Children come into contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> all the time .
They can learn from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Little English Whiz</ENAMEX> on television , or read the children 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">EZ Talk</ENAMEX> .
Let 's hope they 'll feel completely at ease speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and enjoy the learning process .

Snowman , present , candy , socks ... With the words and pictures side - by - side up on the blackboard , the kids grasp immediately that the subject is <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Christmas</ENAMEX> .
Singing songs is a popular technique for teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> to kids .

It has become popular in recent years to send children to academic camps overseas to learn <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> while getting a look at the big , wide world .

The nice thing about languages is that you can make use of them .
For people living in cosmopolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> , there are lots of opportunities to speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> .
p. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</ENAMEX>
It 's not just the responsibility of schools and teachers to spur children 's interest in language .
Parents should also look at picture books with their children to get them used to foreign languages .
