Steel jackets of a type that may have prevented collapse of the columns of a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5-mile</ENAMEX> stretch of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Nimitz Freeway</ENAMEX> had been installed on at least a small test section of the double - decker highway <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> , employees familiar with the project say .
The test project -- which reportedly survived <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> 's earthquake -- was a prelude to a state plan to retrofit that critical section of the freeway with the steel casings .
State engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns , wrenched and separated from the double - decker roadbed , that was responsible for the collapse .
The failure in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> of the freeway segment known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cypress</ENAMEX> structure was the deadliest aspect of the quake , although officials were hopeful <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> that the death toll there might be significantly lower than the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</ENAMEX> initially feared .
Sorting out the wreckage is expected to take <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</ENAMEX> .
Red tractors gingerly picked at the rubble while jackhammers tried to break up some of the massive slabs of concrete .
Giant yellow cranes were wheeled up alongside the collapsed segment , preparing to lift off chunks of the debris .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sacramento</ENAMEX> , a transportation department spokesman said he could n't immediately confirm or deny existence of the test work .
However , he asserted that the department had n't mastered the technology needed to retrofit the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cypress</ENAMEX> structure .
Moreover , other officials noted , snafus in transportation funding that the state has experienced over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</ENAMEX> may have restricted the availability of funds for such a retrofitting , even if it were technologically feasible .
Knowledgeable employees said the retrofitting , which had n't yet been budgeted , was part of a planned , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> - stage reinforcement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cypress</ENAMEX> structure begun by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> transportation department <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cypress</ENAMEX> reinforcement project itself was part of an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> effort to shore up structures believed vulnerable to earthquakes .
The state began such work after a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</ENAMEX> tremblor in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Southern California</ENAMEX> , when numerous bridges collapsed .
`` We had just finished phase <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> '' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cypress</ENAMEX> project that involved installing a series of retaining cables designed to prevent sections of the roadway from separating as a result of seismic shock , a state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DOT</ENAMEX> engineer said .
After completing installation of the jackets on `` <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> frame '' of the freeway <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DOT</ENAMEX> had sent the project over to its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sacramento</ENAMEX> engineers to draw up a final design .
Knowledgeable employees said the project had been stymied somewhat by `` the difficulty of designing '' the jackets .
The procedure involves encasing the concrete columns with steel , then connecting them more securely to the double - decker roadbed .
The employees also said the project may have been snagged by budgetary concerns .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> preliminary estimate put the retrofitting cost at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 50 million</ENAMEX> .
The collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials .
Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Deukmejian</ENAMEX> , who said he had been assured by state transportation officials that the structure could withstand an even larger quake , called for an immediate investigation .
`` I want to know who made the decision that it was safe for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">186,000</ENAMEX> people to use <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Katz</ENAMEX> , a state legislator who is chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the California Assembly 's</ENAMEX> transportation committee .
He said he would convene hearings within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cypress</ENAMEX> structure opened in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1957</ENAMEX> , and as such , like many buildings in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area , does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support .
The northern piers of the span lie in estuarian deposits that were of a type to have liquefied easily during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the 1906 quake</ENAMEX> .
Transportation department officials , however , said they were as surprised as anyone by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cypress</ENAMEX> destruction .
They said previous earthquakes suggested that multiple - column viaducts would stand up well , although they were working on ways to bolster them .
`` Unfortunately , there is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</ENAMEX> laboratory for developing techniques to withstand earthquakes , and that is an earthquake , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burch Bachtold</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> district director for the transportation department .
He said : `` We know of no technology that exists anywhere in the world that would allow us to '' reinforce the columns .
