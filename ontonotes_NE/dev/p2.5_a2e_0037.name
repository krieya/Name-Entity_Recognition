<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> is receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abd al - Aziz Baqir al - Hakim</ENAMEX> , the head of the so - called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Council for the Islamic Revolution</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the White House</ENAMEX> .
Welcome .
He rolls out the red carpet for him , Thanking him for accepting the invitation he sent him to meet with him .
He discusses with him the matter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> quagmire that has submerged <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States of America</ENAMEX> , seeking his help to get him out of that morass . Knowing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Council for the Islamic Revolution</ENAMEX> , which is headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abd al - Aziz Baqir al - Hakim</ENAMEX> , was one of the parties that suggested the invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> .
That was when the Council was headed by his brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muhammad Baqir al - Hakim</ENAMEX> , who was assassinated after the entry of the ugly <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
So he is seeking his help now to get out of his predicament .
This is not the amusing paradox .
Rather , it is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abd al - Aziz Baqir al - Hakim</ENAMEX> heads the armed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Badr Militia</ENAMEX> that is fueling the sectarian conflict in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and is accused of bloodshed and aggression -- the very terrorism that President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> claims to be in a fierce war against .
He is welcomed and greeted at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">White House</ENAMEX> , to be used as a tool with which to fight the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiite</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muqtada al - Sadr</ENAMEX> , who stands against the presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , and against <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> himself , in order to finish him and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Al - Mahdi Army</ENAMEX> which he leads .
