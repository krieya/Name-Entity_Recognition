<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> share prices rebounded <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> , with the Nikkei index of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">225</ENAMEX> selected stocks rising <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">618.69</ENAMEX> points to close the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> session at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35087.38</ENAMEX> .
The index slid <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">647.33</ENAMEX> points , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</ENAMEX> , on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 25 minutes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> 's trading the Nikkei index soared <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">664.83</ENAMEX> points , to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35133.83</ENAMEX> .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10 a.m.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> time , the index was up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435.11</ENAMEX> points , to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34903.80</ENAMEX> as investors hailed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York 's</ENAMEX> overnight rally .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> 's slide came in a relatively calm session that did n't provide much direction for other markets .
Shares also closed sharply lower across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> , although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Pacific</ENAMEX> markets had sharper losses than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , but the selling wave stopped short of precipitating another market crash .
All eyes were on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> at the opening because it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> major market to trade since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</ENAMEX> - point plunge on Wall Street .
But rather than set the tone for other markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's major institutional investors chose to remain on the sidelines .
Still , despite the sudden reappearance of stock - market turbulence , managers of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investment funds said they were n't planning to unload <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> equities .
`` We did n't trade much <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , as our policy now is to wait and see , '' said a fund manager at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taisho Life Insurance Co</ENAMEX> .
`` We would like to wait and see until trading goes around through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> . ''
The institutions appeared confident that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary , and there was considerable speculation during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> was working behind the scenes to do just that .
But in the absence of panicky trading , its presence was never overtly felt .
At the close , the Nikkei average of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">225</ENAMEX> stocks stood at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34468.69</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">647.33</ENAMEX> points , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</ENAMEX> .
The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45.66</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7 %</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2600.88</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> 's decline was generally in line with analysts ' weekend predictions .
Declining issues swamped advancers , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">941</ENAMEX> - 105 .
But volume was thin at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">526.2 million</ENAMEX> shares , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">574.7 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
The market opened sharply lower , with the Nikkei average down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 600</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">midmorning</ENAMEX> rebound brought it back to show a gain of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 200</ENAMEX> at the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> session , but the rally failed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</ENAMEX> , and the market closed near the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> 's low .
The smaller stocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> market 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> section also posted their biggest decline of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tokyo Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> index for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> section fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100.96</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.7 %</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3655.40</ENAMEX> .
Many investors , trying to outperform the market 's major indexes , have flocked to these small issues in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investors and traders expressed relief that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> market did n't fall more sharply .
But its performance did bear some resemblance to events of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> , during the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1987</ENAMEX> global stock market crash .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 16 , 1987</ENAMEX> -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Black Monday</ENAMEX> crash -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> market dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> followed on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.4 %</ENAMEX> drop .
This time , Wall Street 's plunge of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.9 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> was followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</ENAMEX> loss in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> 's biggest fall came <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.6 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Black Monday</ENAMEX> plunge , when the Nikkei average fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.9 %</ENAMEX> .
Thus , market participants <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> were looking ahead nervously to Wall Street 's opening .
But in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88.12</ENAMEX> to close at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2657.38</ENAMEX> on heavy volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">416,290,000</ENAMEX> shares , although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nobuto Yasuda</ENAMEX> , a director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yamaichi Investment Trust -AMP- Management Co.</ENAMEX> , called <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's session `` a good scenario '' for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
`` Now we are looking for the time to place buy orders , '' he said .
`` For us institutional investors , the chance for buying has come . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isao Ushikubo</ENAMEX> , general manager of the investment research department at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyo Trust -AMP- Banking Co.</ENAMEX> , also was optimistic .
He described <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's plunge in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> as a `` fleeting '' event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity .
`` Unless there is a panic , this is the best time to buy , as was the case <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
`` Those shares which had posted gains on M-AMP-A speculation were dashed with cold water , but as far as major stocks are concerned , there is n't much impact . ''
Other fund managers were similarly sanguine .
`` We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masato Murakami</ENAMEX> , chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yasuda Trust -AMP- Banking Co</ENAMEX> .
He said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's Wall Street decline was `` well within the range of volatility '' that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yasuda Trust</ENAMEX> plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy .
Among other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Pacific</ENAMEX> markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> had the biggest losses , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> composite index in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> falling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.5 %</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> 's Straits Times Industrial Index down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> .
Major indexes declined <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 8 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seoul</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jakarta</ENAMEX> escaped with slightly smaller losses .
Brokers and fund managers said the region 's markets were reacting to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy - outs and a deteriorating junk - bond market .
`` It 's pure psychology , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Au Yeung</ENAMEX> , an account executive for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel Burnham Lambert -LRB- HK -RRB- Ltd.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
`` Markets in this region are n't so geared to leveraged buy - outs , and their economies generally are in good shape , but there 's no doubt that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> is still following <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's lead . ''
Several analysts said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is the region 's next most open market , but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> amid political turmoil in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> took the hit because when people want to get out , they tend to go where the liquidity is , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Hambrecht</ENAMEX> , a regional analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Baring Securities -LRB- Hong Kong -RRB- Ltd</ENAMEX> .
She pointed out that even after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> decline , the Straits Times index is up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , so investors who bailed out generally did so profitably .
Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur 's</ENAMEX> composite index <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> ended <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27.5 %</ENAMEX> above its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> close .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , the Hang Seng Index fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180.60</ENAMEX> to finish at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2601.70</ENAMEX> .
Trading was heavy at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one billion</ENAMEX> shares , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">473.9 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
But the session was orderly , in contrast to the market 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - day</ENAMEX> closure after the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Chenevix - Trench</ENAMEX> , a director at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Baring International Fund Managers Ltd.</ENAMEX> , said the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close .
`` If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> does n't collapse , I see maybe another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> on the downside , not counting the risk of bad news out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> 's All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ordinaries</ENAMEX> index closed at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1601.5</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.1 %</ENAMEX> , its biggest drop since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1987</ENAMEX> .
But volume rose only to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">162 million</ENAMEX> shares from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">143 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nestor Hinzack</ENAMEX> , an analyst at brokerage firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Burdett , Buckeridge -AMP- Young Ltd.</ENAMEX> , described the market 's performance as `` sheep - like '' as investors fled to bluechip <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Australian</ENAMEX> stocks and shunned entrepreneurial companies they perceived as having any takeover premium built into the price .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Financial Times - Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> - share index , the most closely watched market barometer , ended at its intraday high of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2163.4</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70.5</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.2 %</ENAMEX> .
At its low , shortly before Wall Street opened , it was off <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 130</ENAMEX> points .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Financial Times</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> - share index closed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79.3</ENAMEX> points lower at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1738.7</ENAMEX> .
Volume more than doubled to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">959.3 million</ENAMEX> shares from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">457.7 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
Prices on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Frankfurt Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> tumbled in heavy trading .
The decline in the German Stock Index of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">203.56</ENAMEX> points , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.8 %</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1385.72</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> market 's steepest fall ever .
Retail investors dumped holdings on a massive scale , pushing some blue - chip shares down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 20 %</ENAMEX> .
Analysts cited memories of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> , when many small investors held on to their shares after the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> crash but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> market continued to decline steeply for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next three months</ENAMEX> .
Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as calculated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Geneva</ENAMEX> .
To make them directly comparable , each index is based on the close of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</ENAMEX> equaling <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> .
The percentage change is since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year - end</ENAMEX> .
