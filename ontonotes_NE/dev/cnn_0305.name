Reporter :
Before the war , I was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX> .
We were waiting for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> refugees to show off .
Everyone thought would stream from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX> , like did in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> did n't show up .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 9th</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 130</ENAMEX> journalists from around the world including myself and a couple of reporters , we were going to try to cross the border because we were all desperate to get into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two days</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> statue fell and we all knew it was over .

<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">156</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> police officers were supposed to show up to this college to report for work , but instead , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</ENAMEX> showed up because they heard about it on the radio , so the whole college was swarmed with police officers wanting their jobs back , and this gentleman was kind of in charge of the whole operation and one man has his arms up yelling at him .
Was basically an angry officer demanding his job .
We came across a checkpoint and there were about maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> locals with AK machine guns and checking cars .
Those kind of neat that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> are taking pride in the fall of the regime and wanting to restore order themselves .
We had heard rumors of an underground prison , and rumor had it there was a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kuwaitis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> held in this underground prison that people forgot about , so we went into this bunker hoping to find a prison and run into these prisoners and instead we ran into a room full of weapons from bullets to hand grenade , land mines , rocket - propelled grenades .
