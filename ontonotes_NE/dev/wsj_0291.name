Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Deukmejian</ENAMEX> and key legislators agreed to back a temporary <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">one - quarter - cent</ENAMEX> increase in the state sales tax to raise <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 800 million</ENAMEX> for repairs and relief associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month 's</ENAMEX> earthquake .
The tax increase , which will be considered at a special session of the state legislature that begins <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> , would cover only part of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">the estimated $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion</ENAMEX> in total damage caused by the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 17</ENAMEX> quake .
Aside from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 3.45 billion</ENAMEX> in recently approved federal aid , the state is expected to draw from a gubernatorial emergency fund that currently stands at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 700 million</ENAMEX> .
`` I am not aware that there is anything but bipartisan agreement for the general outline '' of the revenue - raising plan , said a spokesman for the governor , after a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> meeting with legislative leaders over the quake - relief question .
The tax increase -- on top of the current <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">six - cent</ENAMEX> per dollar sales tax -- would become effective <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this Dec. 1</ENAMEX> and expire <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 31 , 1990</ENAMEX> .
The sales - tax plan was preferred over an alternative that would have boosted the state gasoline tax .
Some legislators expressed concern that a gas - tax increase would take too long and possibly damage chances of a major gas - tax - increasing ballot initiative that voters will consider <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next June</ENAMEX> .
