Business and civic operations lurched back toward normalcy here as congressional officials estimated that the price tag for emergency assistance to earthquake - ravaged <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> would total <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 2.5 billion</ENAMEX> .
`` That is a minimum figure , and I underscore minimum , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Foley</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wash .</ENAMEX> -RRB- after conferring with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> lawmakers .
`` It 's impossible to put an exact figure on it <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at this time</ENAMEX> . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> has begun looking into legislation to provide more funds for earthquake repairs .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</ENAMEX> - member delegation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> is expected to propose that emergency funds be added to a stop - gap spending bill that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> is to consider <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
For the most part , major corporations ' headquarters and plants were unaffected or only slightly damaged by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> 's earthquake , which registered <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.9</ENAMEX> on the Richter scale .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of the last big employers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Silicon Valley</ENAMEX> to report in , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Seagate Technology</ENAMEX> , said it expects to be back at full strength <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">The day</ENAMEX> before the quake , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Seagate</ENAMEX> completed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</ENAMEX> of emergency training and drills .
Echoing the response of almost all big corporations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Bay Area</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Waite</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Seagate</ENAMEX> 's chief financial officer , said , `` I would n't expect this to have any significant financial impact . ''
The city 's recovery from the earthquake was uneven .
Banks indicated they were operating at greater than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 %</ENAMEX> of their usual capacity , but a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Nob Hill</ENAMEX> hotel said tourists had fled , leaving the previously full hotel with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</ENAMEX> vacancy rate .
City crews tallied the wreckage to buildings , but lacked a clear sense of how gravely transportation arteries were disabled .
Among the city 's banks , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bank of America</ENAMEX> said all but <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">850</ENAMEX> branches were open .
The closed branches , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hayward</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> , sustained structural damage .
Power failures kept just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</ENAMEX> automated - teller machines off - line .
Securities - trading operations were moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bank of America 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Concord</ENAMEX> office , and foreign - exchange trading operations were shifted to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , the bank said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wells Fargo -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> said its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Emergency Operations Committee</ENAMEX> -- which met <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">all night</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> -- moved its global - funds transfer system to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Monte</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 miles</ENAMEX> to the south .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only five</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">496</ENAMEX> branches statewide remain closed , while <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</ENAMEX> automated - teller machines remained out of order .
The most extensive damage was in small towns near the quake 's epicenter , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 miles</ENAMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz County</ENAMEX> estimates total damage at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 600 million</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara County</ENAMEX> has a running total so far of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 504 million</ENAMEX> , excluding the hard - hit city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Gatos</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> officials were still uncertain about the magnitude of structural damage <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late yesterday</ENAMEX> ; a section of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I - 880</ENAMEX> , a twotiered highway , collapsed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> , causing a majority of the deaths resulting from the quake .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Agnos</ENAMEX> estimated that damages to the city total <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</ENAMEX> .
That includes dwellings in the ravaged <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Marina</ENAMEX> district that must be demolished , peeled business facades south of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Market Street</ENAMEX> , and houses in the city 's outer <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richmond</ENAMEX> district that were heaved off their foundations .
Many streets and sidewalks buckled , and subterranean water mains and service connections ruptured .
The federal funds would go to a range of programs , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Emergency Management Agency</ENAMEX> , highway construction accounts and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Small Business Administration</ENAMEX> , according to Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vic Fazio</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif .</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FEMA</ENAMEX> , which coordinates federal disaster relief , is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> , which hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolinas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> .
It is likely to get <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 800 million</ENAMEX> initially in additional funds , and eventually could get more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fazio</ENAMEX> , a member of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlin Fitzwater</ENAMEX> said there is enough money on hand to deal with immediate requirements .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration has at its disposal <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 273 million</ENAMEX> in funds remaining from the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 billion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> released for the cleanup after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .
`` We feel we have the money necessary to handle the immediate , short - term requirements , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fitzwater</ENAMEX> said .
He added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Transportation Department</ENAMEX> and other agencies are `` developing longer - term legislation '' that should be ready soon .
Much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing highways and bridges .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> lawmakers are seeking changes in rules governing the federal highway relief program so more money can be made available for the state .
Some things ca n't be repaired .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Asian Art Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golden Gate Park</ENAMEX> reports <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million to $ 15 million</ENAMEX> in damage , including shattered porcelains and stone figures .
Its neighbor , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the De Young Museum</ENAMEX> , totaled <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 million to $ 5 million</ENAMEX> in structural damage and shattered sculpture .
The city 's main library is closed because of fissures that opened in its walls , and marble facings and ornamental plaster at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Beaux Arts City Hall</ENAMEX> broke off in the temblor .
The ground along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Embarcadero</ENAMEX> the street that skirts the city 's eastern boundary and piers -- dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six inches</ENAMEX> after the quake , wreaking major damage to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</ENAMEX> of the piers .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Francisco International Airport</ENAMEX> , shock waves wrecked the control tower , knocking down computers and shattering glass .
Offices of the city 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rent Board</ENAMEX> were destroyed .
Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agnos</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</ENAMEX> estimate does n't include damage to freeway arteries leading into the city , some of which remained closed .
A major chunk of the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</ENAMEX> is expected to be eaten up by overtime for city workers deployed in the emergency , said a spokesman for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agnos</ENAMEX> .
`` All of the city 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.9 million</ENAMEX> emergency reserve was spent in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 24 hours</ENAMEX> '' on overtime salaries , he said .
Insurers struggled to to get a firm grasp on the volume of claims pouring into their offices .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fireman 's Fund Corp.</ENAMEX> , a spokesman said <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">142</ENAMEX> claims were received in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 24 hours</ENAMEX> after the quake , and the company is braced for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 5,000</ENAMEX> claims from its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35,000</ENAMEX> residential and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35,000</ENAMEX> business policyholders in the affected area .
`` Claims range from a scratched fender -- and there were an awful lot of cars damaged in this -- to a major processing plant , '' a spokesman said .
`` We 're delivering a check for $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">750,000</ENAMEX> to an automotive business in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX> that burned on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fireman 's</ENAMEX> is part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38 million</ENAMEX> syndicate that supplies business interruption insurance to the city on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> , which must pay employees during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the three weeks</ENAMEX> or more it is expected to be out of service and deprived of toll income .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> lawmakers want to eliminate temporarily a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</ENAMEX> cap on the amount of federal highway relief for each state for each disaster , as well as a prohibition on using the emergency highway aid to repair toll roads .
In addition , under the highway - relief program , the federal government provides <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</ENAMEX> of emergency highway aid for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only the first 90 days</ENAMEX> of a repair effort .
After that , the federal share diminishes .
For interstate highways , the federal share normally would drop to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 %</ENAMEX> of the cost of repairs , and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost .
But lawmakers want to extend the period for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</ENAMEX> federal funding for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</ENAMEX> .
Those changes also would apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> areas hit hard by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the U.S. Virgin Islands</ENAMEX> , according to an aide to Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fazio</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FEMA</ENAMEX> announced a toll - free telephone number -LRB- 800-462-9029 -RRB- to expedite service to victims of the earthquake .
Lines will be available <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</ENAMEX> a day to take applications for such disaster relief as temporary housing and emergency home repairs by phone .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Transportation</ENAMEX> officials are expecting utter traffic pandemonium beginning <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> and growing worse over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next several weeks</ENAMEX> .
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</ENAMEX> cars normally cross the closed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> .
Officials say it is clear that alternate routes ca n't handle the overflow .
The state is calling in a flotilla of navy landing vessels and other boats to expand ferry service across the bay and hopes to add numerous new bus routes and train departures to help alleviate the traffic problem .
Moreover , state officials are urging freight haulers to bypass many of the area 's main highways and to travel <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">late at night</ENAMEX> or during <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">predawn hours</ENAMEX> .
Even so , `` We 're looking for chaos , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gray</ENAMEX> , a deputy district director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the California Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> .
`` If there 's any way you can do it , you ought to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> and go fishing for a while . ''
Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco 's</ENAMEX> tourists and business travelers already have left -- despite hotel 's offers of rate cuts .
`` Everyone left , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Lang</ENAMEX> , reservations manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Mark Hopkins Hotel</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westin St. Francis</ENAMEX> hotel , which survived the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1906</ENAMEX> earthquake and fire , currently is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50 %</ENAMEX> occupied .
`` We still have our die - hard baseball fans , '' a spokesman said .
`` One lady from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> said she 's not going home until <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the -LCB- World Series -RCB-</ENAMEX> is over . ''
