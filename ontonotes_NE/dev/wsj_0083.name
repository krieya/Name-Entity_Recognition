While worry grows about big <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investments in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's big trading companies are rapidly increasing their stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's smaller business .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , the controversial trend improves access to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> markets and technology .
But for small <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> companies , it also provides a growing source of capital and even marketing help .
Take the deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Candela Laser Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wayland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , manufacturer of high - tech medical devices , which <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</ENAMEX> set its sights on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> as an export market .
Partly to help clear the myriad obstacles facing any overseas company trying to penetrate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Candela</ENAMEX> turned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsui -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's largest trading companies , for investment .
In a joint - venture deal , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsui</ENAMEX> guided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Candela</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> 's bureaucratic maze .
It eventually secured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ministry of Health</ENAMEX> import approval for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Candela</ENAMEX> laser products -- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> that breaks up kidney stones and another that treats skin lesions .
At last count , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Candela</ENAMEX> had sold <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 million</ENAMEX> of its medical devices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
The deal also gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsui</ENAMEX> access to a high - tech medical product .
`` They view this as a growth area so they went about it with a systematic approach , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Olsen</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Candela</ENAMEX> vice president .
Indeed , for many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> trading companies , the favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> small business is one whose research and development can be milked for future <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> use .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> companies bankroll many small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> companies with promising products or ideas , frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks wo n't touch .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> companies have financed small and medium - sized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> firms for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> , but in recent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> , the pace has taken off .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half of 1989</ENAMEX> alone , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> corporations invested <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 214 million</ENAMEX> in minority positions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> companies , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61 %</ENAMEX> rise from the figure for all of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , reports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Venture Economics Inc</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Needham</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , concern tracks investments in new businesses .
In addition , of course , some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investments involved outright purchase of small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> firms .
Heightened <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> companies control of large , highly visible <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> corporations , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc</ENAMEX> .
Only this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> , it was announced that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Estate Co.</ENAMEX> had acquired a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</ENAMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller Group</ENAMEX> , which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York 's</ENAMEX> prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rockefeller Center</ENAMEX> .
While the small deals are far less conspicuous , they add to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> penetration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> market .
As the deals also improve <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> access to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> technology and market knowledge , they feed <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> anxieties in this area , too .
Even a low - tech product like plate glass can catch a trading company 's fancy if there 's a strategic fit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Free State Glass Industries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warrenton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX> , a small fabricator of architectural glass , was foundering under its original management .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi International Corp.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> - based arm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Corp.</ENAMEX> , bought controlling interest in the glass company in a joint venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Bodner</ENAMEX> , a glass industry executive and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> consultant .
The deal is chiefly designed to give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> a window on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> glass industry , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ichiro Wakui</ENAMEX> , an executive in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> 's general merchandise department in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's not just a simple investment in a small company , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wakui</ENAMEX> says .
`` We want to see the glass market from the inside , not the outside . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> 's investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Free State</ENAMEX> is `` very small ... less than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 million</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wakui</ENAMEX> says .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bodner</ENAMEX> declines to comment on the arrangement .
Trading companies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsui , C. Itoh -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissho - Iwai Corp.</ENAMEX> , which make many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investments in small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> concerns , have no <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> counterpart .
These vertically integrated combines , some of which got their start in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's feudal period , deal globally in commodities , construction and manufacturing .
They operate ships and banks .
`` All the `` sogo - shosha '' are looking for new business , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Klauser</ENAMEX> , adviser to the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsui , U.S.A.</ENAMEX> , using the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> term for the largest of the global trading houses .
Adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takeshi Kondo</ENAMEX> , senior vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">C. Itoh America Inc.</ENAMEX> : `` We have a great interest in making investments , particularly in new ventures . ''
A host of electronics firms in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Silicon Valley</ENAMEX> were financed with trading - company venture capital .
Profit , at least in the short term , is usually a secondary goal .
`` Strategic objectives , not financial return , drive many of the deals , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Venture Economics</ENAMEX> spokesman .
In investing on the basis of future transactions , a role often performed by merchant banks , trading companies can cut through the logjam that small - company owners often face with their local commercial banks .
`` It 's the classic problem of the small businessman , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Davies</ENAMEX> , managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trading Alliance Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
`` People are queuing at the door to take his product but he does n't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial banks are very unsympathetic .
They want assets , they want a balance sheet , which has no relation to the business a company can generate . ''
Adds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsui</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klauser</ENAMEX> : `` Unlike corporations in this country , trading companies are n't so much interested in a high return on investment as they are on increasing trade flows .
To the extent they can do this , they 're quite content to get a return on investment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</ENAMEX> . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klauser</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsui</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> subsidiaries in which it holds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</ENAMEX> interest or more and the trading company hopes to double the number of its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> affiliates in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> .
Sales by these subsidiaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fiscal year ending last March</ENAMEX> were more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 billion</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</ENAMEX> return on <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 billion</ENAMEX> `` ai n't hay , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klauser</ENAMEX> says .
