<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Iverson Technology Corp.</ENAMEX> was one of the fastest - growing small companies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> -- until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">McLean</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX> , company modifies computers to keep sensitive military data out of unfriendly hands .
From <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , its earnings soared <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL" E_OFF="5">six-fold</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.8 million</ENAMEX> , on a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL" E_OFF="5">seven-fold</ENAMEX> increase in revenue , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 44.1 million</ENAMEX> .
But in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , it ran into a buzz saw : a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Defense Department</ENAMEX> spending freeze .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Iverson</ENAMEX> 's earnings plunged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2 million</ENAMEX> .
The troubles continued in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year 's first half</ENAMEX> , when profit plunged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81 %</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">302,000</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Iverson Technology</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of many small defense contractors besieged by the slowdown in defense spending .
Unlike larger contractors with a broad enough base to weather the downturn easily , these companies are suffering big drops in business as once - lucrative specialty niches in the massive military market erode or even disappear .
Companies that only recently were thriving find themselves scrambling to survive .
As their varied strategies suggest , there is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</ENAMEX> way to respond to a disaster -- though it 's too soon to tell whether the changes will pay off .
For many companies , the instinctive first response is to cut costs .
Others are trying to find specialty defense work spared by the slowdown or new niches created by budget - cutting .
More venturesome businesses are applying their skills in commercial fields .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ERC International Inc.</ENAMEX> , which provides professional and technical services to the military , is refining its defense niche , not retreating from it .
After quadrupling <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> earnings over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.8 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairfax</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX> , company , posted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 %</ENAMEX> drop in earnings for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year 's first half</ENAMEX> .
In the belief that development of advanced military technology will remain a top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Defense Department</ENAMEX> priority , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ERC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">W.J. Schafer Associates</ENAMEX> , a technical and scientific analysis company with contracts under the Strategic Defense Initiative .
While the SDI anti-missile program recently awarded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.J. Schafer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> contracts totaling <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.4 million</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ERC</ENAMEX> 's chairman and founder , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Aalseth</ENAMEX> , says he bought the company `` more for its technology than its customer . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UNC Inc.</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Annapolis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Md.</ENAMEX> , contractor that earned <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23.8 million</ENAMEX> on revenue of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400.4 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , has gone even further in realigning its military business .
As orders for its aircraft and submarine parts dwindled , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> of steady growth ended with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69 %</ENAMEX> drop in income in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year 's first half</ENAMEX> .
The company hit on a new strategy : If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Defense Department</ENAMEX> is so intent on saving money , why not make money off that trend ?
Among the company 's current efforts : repairing old parts at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</ENAMEX> of the cost of replacing them .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UNC</ENAMEX> also is selling new parts , if needed , directly to the military instead of through a prime contractor .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as little as one - third</ENAMEX> of the government 's cost , the company is running a program to train <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Army</ENAMEX> helicopter pilots .
It is also taking over the maintenance of certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> aircraft with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> fewer people than the military used .
In another approach , tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Iverson Technology</ENAMEX> is trying to resume its growth by braving the new world of commercial products .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Iverson</ENAMEX> , chairman , says he hopes the company can eventually get <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to half</ENAMEX> of its revenue from commercial markets .
For now , he says , `` we 're looking at buying some small companies with niche markets in the personal - computer business . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this month</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iverson</ENAMEX> agreed to buy exclusive rights to a software system developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Visher Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX> .
The product automates an array of functions performed at small to medium - size printing companies .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iverson</ENAMEX> says there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</ENAMEX> potential customers for the software in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> , area alone .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">QuesTech Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Falls Church</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX> , also has acquired some companies outside the military market .
Moreover , it 's trying to transfer its skill at designing military equipment to commercial ventures .
A partnership with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Williamsburg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX> , unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shell Oil Co.</ENAMEX> recently patented a process for producing plastic food containers that wo n't melt in microwave ovens .
`` We 're trying to take the imagination and talent of our engineers and come up with new processes for industry , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Salvatori</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">QuesTech</ENAMEX> 's chief executive .
`` It is an effort to branch out from the government , which is very difficult for a defense contractor . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salvatori</ENAMEX> should know .
Instead of helping his company in the defense spending slowdown , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dynamic Engineering Inc.</ENAMEX> , a troubled subsidiary that makes wind tunnels for the space industry , contributed to much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">QuesTech</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.3 million</ENAMEX> loss on <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55.6 million</ENAMEX> in revenue <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salvatori</ENAMEX> sold the unit .
`` It was our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> acquisition , '' he says , `` and it was a mistake . ''
Some companies are cutting costs and hoping for the best .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Telos Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Monica</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , provider of software - development and hardware - maintenance services to the military , enjoyed steady growth until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
Following a tripling of earnings , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.9 million</ENAMEX> , on a doubling of revenue , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 116 million</ENAMEX> , over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> , earnings in the company 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal first quarter</ENAMEX> , which ended <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 30</ENAMEX> , plunged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 %</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">45,000</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - time write - off for booking nonexistent revenue was partly to blame , but so were lower profits from a stingier contract with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Army</ENAMEX> and delays in getting paid .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Telos</ENAMEX> responded by combining <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> divisions to reduce expenses and `` bring more focus to potentially fewer bidding opportunities , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin Conger</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Telos</ENAMEX> chairman and controlling shareholder .
`` It 's evident we 're entering a more competitive <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">era</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TransTechnology Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sherman Oaks</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , defense contractor that earned <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.2 million</ENAMEX> on revenue of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 235.2 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , provides a more dramatic example of cost - cutting .
The company not only merged <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> military - electronics manufacturing operations , but also closed an unrelated plant that makes ordnance devices used in fighter planes and missiles .
The closing contributed to a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.4 million</ENAMEX> loss in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fiscal first quarter ended July 31</ENAMEX> -- its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</ENAMEX> loss since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</ENAMEX> .
`` Our ordnance business has been hurt very badly by the slowdown , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arch Scurlock</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TransTechnology</ENAMEX> 's chairman .
`` I would n't say we 're out of the business .
But we 're not making as many -LCB- pyrotechnic devices -RCB- as we used to .
