Now was that <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a quarter cup</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half cup</ENAMEX> ?
Not a gripping question , unless you 're the pastry chef of this city 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chez Panisse</ENAMEX> restaurant and you 've just lost your priceless personal dessert notebook .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chez Panisse</ENAMEX> was listed among the top <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> restaurants in the world <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Connoisseur</ENAMEX> magazine .
The tattered black binder , bulging with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">18 years '</ENAMEX> worth of recipes held together by rubber bands , was in chef <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindsey Shere</ENAMEX> 's purse when it was stolen from her house recently .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX> police do n't have any leads but doubt the crime was driven by a passion for sweets .
Instead , they figure the culprit probably took money from Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shere</ENAMEX> 's wallet and discarded all the tips in the <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five - by - eight - inch</ENAMEX> looseleaf .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chez Panisse</ENAMEX> , whose founder , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Waters</ENAMEX> , is considered the inventor of the cooking style known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> cuisine and whose patrons make reservations <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</ENAMEX> in advance , has n't exactly subjected diners to vanilla ice cream because of the theft .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shere</ENAMEX> can draw on her cookbook , published by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Random House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years ago</ENAMEX> , which is teeming with recipes for such specialties as kiwi sherbet , gooseberry fool -LRB- a creamy dish made with crushed stewed berries -RRB- and hazelnut `` oeufs a la neige . ''
For another , sympathetic fans have sent Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shere</ENAMEX> copies of her recipes clipped from magazines over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</ENAMEX> .
Still , the restaurant 's ever - changing menu of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> - course dinners -- it supposedly has n't repeated a meal since opening in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</ENAMEX> -- requires constant improvisation .
And that puts added pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chez Panisse</ENAMEX> dessert - menu planners .
`` We make what we know how to make , '' says business manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Mazzera</ENAMEX> .
Many in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Bay Area 's</ENAMEX> pastry community express disbelief that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shere</ENAMEX> kept <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</ENAMEX> copy of such valuable notes , but she has received moral support from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Baker 's Dozen</ENAMEX> , a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> pastry chefs that meets regularly to discuss issues like how to keep meringues from weeping and how bovine eating habits affect butter texture .
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shere</ENAMEX> has offered a $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">500</ENAMEX> reward for the book 's return but figures she 'll have to reinvent many recipes from scratch .
`` It 's an overwhelming job , '' she says .
`` There are so many possible proportions when you consider how many things are made out of eggs and butter and milk .
