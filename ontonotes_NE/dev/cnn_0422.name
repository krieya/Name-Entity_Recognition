It 'll be a busy weekend for Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> on the sidelines of the forum , members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> quartet meeting on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> .
It 's composed of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Union</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> .
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.N.</ENAMEX> envoy says the group 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> priority is to negotiate a transfer of military power over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaza</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Palestinian Authority</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheila Macvicar</ENAMEX> has the latest .
Reporter :
There are some suggestions after the visit <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colin Powell</ENAMEX> meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ariel Sharon</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbas</ENAMEX> said more progress may be made on implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> administration 's road map to peace .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">`` The Los Angeles Times ''</ENAMEX> reporting that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> officials may be very close to reaching a deal for security control , not just of a small part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaza</ENAMEX> , but returning all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Gaza Strip</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> control , that 's a very significant step , indeed , plus the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Bank</ENAMEX> city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The `` L.A. Times ''</ENAMEX> reporting that negotiations are continuing and will resume <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> .
Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> officials telling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> that the size of the area to be returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Gaza Strip</ENAMEX> is not so much the question confirming that , in fact , returning all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Gaza Strip</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> security control is one of the options the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> have indeed put on the table .
The issue is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> readiness and willingness to be able to implement full security control throughout all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Gaza Strip</ENAMEX> .
Now , from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> perspective , that also means they would expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Palestinian Authority</ENAMEX> to fairly quickly begin to disarm and dismantle organizations like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> in particular .
