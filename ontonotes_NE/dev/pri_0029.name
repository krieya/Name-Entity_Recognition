In the other major story out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> Foreign Ministers met <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> in advance of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> 's summit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> called the emergency summit to declare support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> in the wake of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</ENAMEX> of violence that has left <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 106</ENAMEX> people dead , almost all of them <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> .
Violence has abated somewhat since the deal was struck at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sharm el - Sheikh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days ago</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> governments are under pressure from their own citizens to take a tough stance against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Drummond</ENAMEX> , covering the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> summit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Financial Times</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> , there 's a reason why the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> wanted this pre-summit meeting .
What is the pressure on them prior to the summit ?
Well , I think they want to try and iron out any potential difficulties before the heads of state come into town on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> .
So this is a preparatory exercise to reach some sort of agreement beforehand .
Of course , the problem is that not all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> states are speaking again with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> voice .
What do they hope to achieve ? and what can you claim from the statements made <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> ?
It is difficult to say , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> 's summit have traditionally been exercises in division .
We have already seen problems from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Libyan</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muammar Gaddafi</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> who appeared on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Al - Jazeera</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="4">pan-Arab</ENAMEX> satellite channel , and he , rubbish , what he said was a draft statement for the end of the summit on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> .
And he was very categorical that it was too weak and did not harm <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> interests sufficiently .
So we have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gadafi</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> hand .
On the other hand we have <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> which was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> country to make peace with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> state , which is of course also a top recipient of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> aid .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptian</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hosni Mubarak</ENAMEX> is more of a voice of moderation against the other side .
Tell us about what he has been saying .
Well , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mubarak</ENAMEX> has been , as you say , a voice of moderation .
He has invested an awful amount in the peace with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> , and really he can not afford to let it fail .
We have seen some more power techniques perhaps from his Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amre Moussa</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few weeks</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amre Moussa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> at the Foreign Minister 's meeting was calling simply for the return of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Jerusalem</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> , in stark contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Syrian</ENAMEX> Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faruq al - Shara</ENAMEX> who was pulling for a complete cut in diplomatic relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> states that happen .
So <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> is playing a calming role .
It will not want to see anything too strong coming out of this summit due to end on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> .
What seemed to be the prevailing voices at this point ?
There are certainly calls for war against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> .
Is there much support for that ?
Well , actually President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mubarak</ENAMEX> was very categorical <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> in condemning calls for war , which he said were very serious and people should understand the implications of just what it meant .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX> do not want to see any sort of conventional war against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> .
They have both invested enormous amounts in it , and both regimes would be more vulnerable if the peace process were to fail , because detractors and opponents within each country would have ammunition by which to fire at them .
How much is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> entering into the conversation and how much pressure seems to be coming from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> ?
Well today not too much .
I mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> where she met with crown prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Syrian</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bashar Al - Assad</ENAMEX> .
Interestingly enough she is quoted as telling General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanholi</ENAMEX> back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> that she did not really get too much of a reception from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bashar Al - Assad</ENAMEX> in terms of lightening the traditionally antagonistic <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Syrian</ENAMEX> align towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> .
Nonetheless , the fact that she did meet with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bashar Al - Assad</ENAMEX> and it was n't <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> which is traditionally being more dovish and has supported <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> policy , it is significant .
So , as of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , I would say certainly on the surface there has been little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> action .
Well , thank you very much for the update .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Drummond</ENAMEX> , correspondent for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Financial Times of London</ENAMEX> speaking to us from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> .
Thank you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> .
Thanks .
