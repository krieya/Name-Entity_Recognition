<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Federal Communications Commission</ENAMEX> allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Telephone -AMP- Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> to continue offering discount phone services for large - business customers and said it would soon re-examine its regulation of the long - distance market .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FCC</ENAMEX> moves were good news for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> , which has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Sikes</ENAMEX> , the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FCC</ENAMEX> chairman , championed deregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> at his last job as head of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> telecommunications agency .
But it has been an open question whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sikes</ENAMEX> , an extraordinarily cautious man , would continue pushing deregulation at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FCC</ENAMEX> in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure .
`` It means that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sikes</ENAMEX> is serious about the deregulation of long distance , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Grubman</ENAMEX> , a telecommunications analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber Inc.</ENAMEX> , who attended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FCC</ENAMEX> meeting .
`` All the commissioners were in amazing agreement -LCB- to re-examine regulation -RCB- for only having been together for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</ENAMEX> . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FCC</ENAMEX> took <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> specific actions regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> .
By a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</ENAMEX> - 0 vote , it allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> to continue offering special discount packages to big customers , called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tariff 12</ENAMEX> , rejecting appeals by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> competitors that the discounts were illegal .
Then by a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</ENAMEX> - 0 vote , it chose the narrowest possible grounds to strike down a different discount plan , called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tariff 15</ENAMEX> , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> offered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Holiday Corp</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> gave a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 % to 10 %</ENAMEX> discount to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Memphis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenn.</ENAMEX> , company that oversees <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Holiday Inns</ENAMEX> , in response to a similar discount offered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Holiday Corp.</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCI Communications Corp</ENAMEX> .
The agency said that because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCI</ENAMEX> 's offer had expired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> could n't continue to offer its discount plan .
But the agency specifically did n't rule whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> had the right to match offers by competitors if that means giving discounts not generally available to other phone users .
Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Nacchio</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> 's vice president for business - communications services , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> offered a similar <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tariff 15</ENAMEX> discount to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Resort Condominium International</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> , to meet another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCI</ENAMEX> bid .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FCC</ENAMEX> `` did n't say I could n't do it again , '' he said .
Apart from those <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> actions , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sikes</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> other commissioners said they expect to re-examine how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> is regulated since competition has increased .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Firestone</ENAMEX> , chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FCC</ENAMEX> 's common - carrier bureau , said he expected the agency to propose new rules <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> applauded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FCC</ENAMEX> 's actions .
`` The time is long overdue to take a look at the fierce competition in the long - distance business and the rules governing it , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> telecommunications firm said in a statement .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCI</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , was displeased with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FCC</ENAMEX> decision concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tariff 12</ENAMEX> , arguing that `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> can not be allowed to flaunt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FCC</ENAMEX> rules . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Telecommunications Inc. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">US Sprint</ENAMEX> unit said it was `` obviously disappointed '' with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FCC</ENAMEX> decision on <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tariff 12</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">US Sprint</ENAMEX> said was it will petition the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FCC</ENAMEX> decision in federal court .
`` We believe that the court will find it unlawful , '' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">US Sprint</ENAMEX> spokesman .
Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> filed a countersuit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCI</ENAMEX> accusing it of misleading consumers through allegedly `` false and deceptive '' advertising .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> action was the most recent blow in a nasty fight .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this month</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCI</ENAMEX> sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> in federal district court , claiming that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> 's ads are false .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> assembled <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> of its top executives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , all visibly angry , to try to refute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCI</ENAMEX> 's charges .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MCI</ENAMEX> has made hawks out of the upper echelon of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grubman</ENAMEX> , who said he expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> to become increasingly aggressive in dealing with its longtime nemesis .
