<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> has recalled its ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> protesting what it calls <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's escalation of aggression against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> news agency carried a foreign ministry statement that said President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hosni Mubarak</ENAMEX> decided to recall the ambassador after <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> helicopter gunships attacked <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> targets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Gaza Strip</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
The statement did not say whether the recall was temporary .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mubarak</ENAMEX> is a strong supporter of moderation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> conflict .
He has said that a dialogue is the only way to break the current wave of bloody clashes between <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> forces and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> troops shot and killed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</ENAMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</ENAMEX> clashes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaza</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , the head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Palestinian Observer Mission to the United Nations</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nasser al - Kidwa</ENAMEX> says any protection force sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the West Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaza</ENAMEX> must be under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Nations</ENAMEX> control .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VOA</ENAMEX> correspondent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breck Ardery</ENAMEX> , has more from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">UN</ENAMEX> .
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> Secretary General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kofi Annan</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al - Kidwa</ENAMEX> disputed reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> would accept an observer force that was not under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> control .
We stressed the absolute need for the protection to be achieved through a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> observer force composed of unarmed military observers to be deployed throughout the territories occupied by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al - Kidwa</ENAMEX> said only an observer force under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> jurisdiction would have legitimate international authority .
There had previously been reports the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> might accept an observer force from several nations , but not under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> control .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> are urging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the UN Security Council</ENAMEX> to adopt a proposed resolution that would send <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2000</ENAMEX> unarmed observers to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaza</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the West Bank</ENAMEX> .
Backers of the resolution say the observers would provide a measure of protection for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> civilians .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The United States</ENAMEX> has said it will not support such a resolution unless both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> agree to it .
So far , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> has rejected the idea .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> Secretary General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annan</ENAMEX> is talking with both sides .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> Ambassador <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yehuda Lancry</ENAMEX> had no substantial public comment after he met with the Secretary General , except to say the meeting was useful .
