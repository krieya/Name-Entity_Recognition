<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PWA Corp.</ENAMEX> said it plans to sell by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">spring 1992</ENAMEX> all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> passenger planes it acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">248 million Canadian dollar</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 211.6 million</ENAMEX> -RRB- purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wardair Inc</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PWA</ENAMEX> , which recently merged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wardair</ENAMEX> 's operations with those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PWA</ENAMEX> - owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Canadian Airlines International Ltd.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> - biggest airline , said the proposed sale is part of a revised <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year</ENAMEX> plan aimed at streamlining its fleet and shedding debt .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PWA</ENAMEX> would n't estimate the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wardair</ENAMEX> 's aircraft , which include <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Airbus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A310 - 300s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">747 - 100s</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Ireland</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> - based technical analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Avmark Inc.</ENAMEX> , an aircraft evaluation firm , estimated the total `` <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> - life '' value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> planes at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 650 million</ENAMEX> or more .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ireland</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</ENAMEX> DC10 - <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> aircraft that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PWA</ENAMEX> also said it plans to sell , beginning in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> , have a current <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> - life value of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 34 million</ENAMEX> each , or a total <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 374 million</ENAMEX> , raising aggregate potential proceeds from the aircraft sale to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.02 billion</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ireland</ENAMEX> said current demand for used aircraft is strong , partly because surging orders for new aircraft have lengthened waiting lists .
He predicted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PWA</ENAMEX> would have little difficulty attracting prospective buyers .
Under its revised fleet plan , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PWA</ENAMEX> said it will also increase its existing fleet of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">767 - 300ER</ENAMEX> aircraft to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</ENAMEX> , and add <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">747 - 400s</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> units that it previously planned to add by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PWA</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">767 - 300ER</ENAMEX> aircraft scheduled for delivery in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> would be leased out for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two to five years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PWA</ENAMEX> did n't disclose the expected net cost of the fleet overhaul , but a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> - based analyst estimated it at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 450 million -LRB- US</ENAMEX> -RRB- , excluding replacement costs for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC10 - 30</ENAMEX> aircraft that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PWA</ENAMEX> plans to sell , and purchase costs for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 17</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Airbus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">320 - 200</ENAMEX> aircraft that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PWA</ENAMEX> previously ordered .
`` I do n't see this as a debt reduction exercise .
It 's focused on streamlining '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PWA</ENAMEX> 's fleet in a bid to cut training and aircraft servicing costs , the analyst said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PWA</ENAMEX> 's long - term debt and capital lease obligations rose to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 1.24 billion</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the second quarter</ENAMEX> , nearly double the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year - earlier</ENAMEX> figure , reflecting debt absorbed under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wardair</ENAMEX> purchase .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PWA</ENAMEX> said it also expects to announce by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> whether it will take delivery of all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Airbus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">320 - 200</ENAMEX> aircraft it previously ordered .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> leased units were to be delivered in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> .
