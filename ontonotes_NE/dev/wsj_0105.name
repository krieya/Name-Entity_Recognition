Your <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 6</ENAMEX> editorial `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Ill Homeless</ENAMEX> '' referred to research by us and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> of our colleagues that was reported in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 8</ENAMEX> issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Journal of the American Medical Association</ENAMEX> .
Your comments implied we had discovered that the `` principal cause '' of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance - abusing people in the homeless population .
We have made no such statement .
It is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless .
The `` causes '' of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case .
In quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism .
You did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse .
They suffered from malnutrition , chest diseases , cardiovascular disorders , skin problems , infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape .
Homeless people not only lack safety , privacy and shelter , they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition , cleanliness and basic health care .
In a recent report , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Institute of Medicine</ENAMEX> pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness , others may be a consequence of it , and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter .
The interactions between health and homelessness are complex , defying sweeping generalizations as to `` cause '' or `` effect . ''
If we look to the future , preventing homelessness is an important objective .
This will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess , an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research .

A study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tulane</ENAMEX> Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Wright</ENAMEX> says homelessness is due to a complex array of problems , with the common thread of poverty .
The study shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 40 %</ENAMEX> of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 25 %</ENAMEX> of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug , alcohol and mental problems .
According to Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> , homelessness is `` simultaneously a housing problem , an employment problem , a demographic problem , a problem of social disaffiliation , a mental health problem , a family violence problem , a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending , a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family , and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level .

To quote the highly regarded director of a privately funded drop - in center for the homeless in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> : `` If you 're homeless , you do n't sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">your first three weeks</ENAMEX> of sleep deprivation , you 're scarcely in touch with reality any more ; without psychiatric treatment , you may well be unable to fend for yourself ever again . ''
Some of the homeless , obviously , had pre-existing mental illness or addiction .
But many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim , brutal world of our city streets .
Once there , what ways of escape are open to them other than drink , drugs or insanity ?

You dismiss as `` sentimental '' the view that the reduction of federal housing - assistance programs by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77 %</ENAMEX> might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> - Bush <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> .
There is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic : namely , that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness .
Your research stopped when a convenient assertion could be made .

Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 200</ENAMEX> sponsors of the recent march in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> for the homeless , you chose to cite such groups as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Association of Home Builders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen</ENAMEX> , insinuating that the march got its major support from self - serving groups that `` know a good thing when they see it , '' and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive .
But is n't the desire for profit the driving force behind those who subscribe to , and advertise in , your paper ?
Why did n't you mention the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">YMCA</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">YWCA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Catholic Charities USA</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</ENAMEX> other nonprofit organizations that participated in the march ?
As for the findings on the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">203</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> homeless who underwent psychiatric examinations , I suggest you conduct your own survey .
Choose <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">203</ENAMEX> business executives , including , perhaps , someone from your own staff , and put them out on the streets , to be deprived for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</ENAMEX> of their homes , families and income .
I would predict that within a short time most of them would find <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thunderbird</ENAMEX> a satisfactory substitute for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chivas Regal</ENAMEX> and that their `` normal '' phobias , anxieties , depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically .
