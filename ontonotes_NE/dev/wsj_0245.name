<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coca - Cola Co.</ENAMEX> , aiming to boost soft - drink volume in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> , said it is discussing a joint venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fraser -AMP- Neave Ltd.</ENAMEX> , its bottling franchisee in that country .
The venture would be the latest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coke</ENAMEX> 's rapid expansion of overseas investment .
So far <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , it has put <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 700 million</ENAMEX> into bottling operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> .
The move also reflects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coke</ENAMEX> 's eagerness to have a hand in developing the soft - drink markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Pacific Basin</ENAMEX> countries .
Aside from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Pacific</ENAMEX> division is where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coke</ENAMEX> will be focusing much of its attention for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> to come .
That 's because when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coke</ENAMEX> looks to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Pacific</ENAMEX> area , it sees an economic and demographic gold mine .
In countries such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> , economies are growing , resulting in a rise in disposable income that consumers can use for soft drinks .
And unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , where populations are aging , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Pacific Basin</ENAMEX> countries have growing proportions of youths -- the heaviest consumers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coca - Cola</ENAMEX> and other sodas .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coca - Cola</ENAMEX> spokesman said it is too early to say how the joint venture would be structured , or how much the company would invest in the transaction .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</ENAMEX> , however , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coke</ENAMEX> has typically taken a minority stake in such ventures .
By acquiring stakes in bottling companies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and overseas , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coke</ENAMEX> has been able to improve bottlers ' efficiency and production , and in some cases , marketing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coke</ENAMEX> has tended to increase its control when results were sluggish in a given country .
That does n't appear to be the case in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> , a country of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three million</ENAMEX> people with a relatively high soft - drink consumption rate -- a key indicator of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coke</ENAMEX> 's success in a market .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> , per - capita consumption is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one - third</ENAMEX> that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
And combining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fraser -AMP- Neave 's</ENAMEX> own soft drinks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coca - Cola 's</ENAMEX> gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> company more than half the share of the soda market there , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coke</ENAMEX> said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fraser -AMP- Neave</ENAMEX> , which also has interests in packaging , beer and dairy products , holds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coke</ENAMEX> licenses for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brunei</ENAMEX> , where per - capita consumption is n't as high as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coke</ENAMEX> could be interested in more quickly developing some of the untapped potential in those markets .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coke</ENAMEX> spokesman said he could n't say whether that is the direction of the talks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coke</ENAMEX> said the joint - venture arrangement , which needs approval from both companies ' boards , should be completed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early next year</ENAMEX> .
