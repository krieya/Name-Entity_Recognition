<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> 's second bout of general elections <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> is slated for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 5</ENAMEX> .
For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eight - year</ENAMEX> misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - month</ENAMEX> hitch with a conservative - communist coalition government -- there is but <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> bright sign : The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andreas Papandreou</ENAMEX> and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-June</ENAMEX> round of voting , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Greeks</ENAMEX> gave no clear mandate to any single political party .
The ad interim coalition government that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was , in essence , little more than the ill - conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation : On <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> side , the center - right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New Democracy Party</ENAMEX> , headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine Mitsotakis</ENAMEX> .
On the other , the so - called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coalition of the Left and Progress</ENAMEX> -- a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="4">pro-Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Communist Party</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Euro</ENAMEX> - Communist cousin , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Hellenic Left</ENAMEX> .
The unifying bond for this left - right mismatch was plain : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PASOK</ENAMEX> -LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> 's party -RRB- as common political enemy .
The ostensible goal was a mop - up of government corruption , purportedly at all levels , but the main marks were Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> and his closest associates .
In point of fact , this catharsis was overdue by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</ENAMEX> .
When reduced to buzzword status in ex parte pledges , however , the notion transmogrified into a promised assault , with targets primarily for political gains , not justice .
With regard to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> 's long - bubbling bank - looting scandal , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> 's principal accuser remains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Koskotas</ENAMEX> , former owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bank of Crete</ENAMEX> and self - confessed embezzler , now residing in a jail cell in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salem</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas</ENAMEX> 's credibility is , at best , problematic .
He has ample motive to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found less than forthright on numerous points .
Nevertheless , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New Democracy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communist</ENAMEX> parties herald his assertions as proof of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PASOK</ENAMEX> complicity .
Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> received <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23 million</ENAMEX> of stolen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bank of Crete</ENAMEX> funds and an additional $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">734,000</ENAMEX> in bribes , as contended ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 57 million</ENAMEX> in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas</ENAMEX> 's bank and then skim off the interest ; and , what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PASOK</ENAMEX> 's cut was from the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 210 million</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas</ENAMEX> pinched .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> former ministers were so heavily implicated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas</ENAMEX> affair that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PASOK</ENAMEX> members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parliament</ENAMEX> voted to refer them to the special court .
But eluding parliamentary probe was the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of drachmas</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas</ENAMEX> funneled into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New Democracy</ENAMEX> coffers .
In the end , the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and `` indications '' that point to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PASOK</ENAMEX> , not clinching proof .
On another issue , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Greeks</ENAMEX> were told how their national intelligence agency , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EYP</ENAMEX> , regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures , including key opposition politicians , journalists and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PASOK</ENAMEX> cabinet members .
Despite convincing arguments , it was never established that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> personally ordered or directed the wiretaps .
The central weakness of the `` scandals '' debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks .
The coalition government tried to show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PASOK</ENAMEX> ministers had received hefty sums for OKing the purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F - 16 Fighting Falcon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mirage 2000</ENAMEX> combat aircraft , produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE" E_OFF="5">U.S.based</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Dynamics Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Avions Marcel Dassault</ENAMEX> , respectively .
Naturally , neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Dynamics</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dassault</ENAMEX> could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid -LRB- or not -RRB- to various <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Greek</ENAMEX> officials for services rendered .
So it seems that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitsotakis</ENAMEX> and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> a moral victory on a platter : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PASOK</ENAMEX> , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> 's expense .
But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PASOK</ENAMEX> regain power , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> should never be underestimated .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> came his predictable fusillade : He charged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coalition of the Left</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Progress</ENAMEX> had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right - wing plot aimed at ousting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PASOK</ENAMEX> and thwarting the course of socialism in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> .
Then , to buttress his credibility with the left , he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PASOK</ENAMEX> banner .
Next , he continued to court the communists -- many of whom feel betrayed by the left - right coalition 's birth -- by bringing into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PASOK</ENAMEX> a well - respected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Communist Party</ENAMEX> candidate .
For balance , and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes , he managed to attract a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New Democracy Party</ENAMEX> representative and known political enemy of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitsotakis</ENAMEX> .
Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PASOK</ENAMEX> heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal - stench , but also with `` seals of approval '' from representatives of its harshest accusers .
Crucial as these elections are for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> , pressing issues of state are getting lost in the shuffle .
The country 's future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> participation remains unsure , for instance .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> targets of heightened Common Market cooperation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> 's bilateral relations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> need attention soon as well .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> , the current accord concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military bases in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> lapses in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1990</ENAMEX> .
Negotiations for a new agreement were frozen before the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> elections , but the clock is running .
Another matter of concern is the extradition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Rashid</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> terrorist who is wanted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> bombing of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pan American Airways</ENAMEX> flight .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Greek</ENAMEX> courts have decided in favor of extradition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rashid</ENAMEX> case , but the matter awaits final approval from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> 's next justice minister .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Greeks</ENAMEX> seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism .
That <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PASOK</ENAMEX> could win the elections outright is improbable ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Greek</ENAMEX> press , previously eager to palm off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PASOK</ENAMEX> 's line , has turned on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> with a wild - eyed vengeance .
Yet the possibility of another lash - up government is all too real .
If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> becomes the major opposition leader , he could hamstring a conservative - led coalition .
Also , he could force new elections <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early next year</ENAMEX> by frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New Democracy</ENAMEX> has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PASOK</ENAMEX> , forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles .
As for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> ?
He 's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage .
But since he is undoubtedly one of the most proficient bull slingers who ever raked muck , it seems far wiser to view him as sidelined , but certainly not yet eliminated .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> , a regional correspondent for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Review</ENAMEX> , has lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> .
