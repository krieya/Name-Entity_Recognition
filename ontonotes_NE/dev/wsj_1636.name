IF YOU FORCE financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence , it would probably be a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - word sentence : Diversify .
Judging by a poll of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> readers conducted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Erdos -AMP- Morgan Inc.</ENAMEX> , serious investors have taken that advice to heart .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly 1,000</ENAMEX> investors responded to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> 's poll , providing an in - depth look at their portfolios .
Those portfolios are remarkably diversified .
By spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives , the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> area , be it stocks , bonds or real estate .
For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 88 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> readers owned stock -LRB- down slightly from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91 %</ENAMEX> in a similar poll <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 17.5 %</ENAMEX> said they had <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</ENAMEX> their money in the stock market .
Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57 %</ENAMEX> of respondents own shares in a money - market mutual fund , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</ENAMEX> own municipal bonds .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 6 % to 7 %</ENAMEX> of the investors were committing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</ENAMEX> their funds to either of those alternatives .
The poll , conducted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 7 - 28</ENAMEX> , also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics .
It found them in a cautious , but not downbeat , mood .
Of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</ENAMEX> people sent a questionnaire , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">951</ENAMEX> replied .
The response rate , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 63 %</ENAMEX> , allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence .
The results ca n't be extrapolated to all investors , though .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> readers are relatively affluent , with a median household income of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 75,000</ENAMEX> and $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">99,000</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly half</ENAMEX> of the respondents -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47 %</ENAMEX> -RRB- said their investment portfolio was worth $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">250,000</ENAMEX> or more , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</ENAMEX> said it was worth <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</ENAMEX> or more .
The respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets , but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</ENAMEX> .
For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> 's respondents said they expect a recession within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 8 %</ENAMEX> were expecting a recession .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">An additional 56 %</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> 's respondents expect the economy to slow down during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 12 months</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 42 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year 's</ENAMEX> respondents anticipated slowing growth .
Apparently , the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much .
A slim majority -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</ENAMEX> -RRB- think stock prices will be higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1990</ENAMEX> than they were in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1989</ENAMEX> .
Their verdict on real estate is almost the same .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Some 50 %</ENAMEX> expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 12 months</ENAMEX> .
By contrast , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 32 %</ENAMEX> expect an increase in the price of gold .
Since gold tends to soar when inflation is high , that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control .
Even though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 12 %</ENAMEX> actually predicted a recession , many respondents were taking a better - safe - than sorry investment stance .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly a third</ENAMEX> said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession .
For the most part , the changes were `` slight . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">The two - thirds</ENAMEX> who have n't tried to make their portfolios more recession - resistant were split about evenly between investors who `` do n't believe in trying to predict the markets '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 31 %</ENAMEX> -RRB- and investors who `` do n't expect a recession '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 %</ENAMEX> -RRB- or are `` unsure if and when a recession might come '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 22 %</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
A buy - and - hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents .
Most own <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to 10</ENAMEX> stocks , and buy or sell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than three</ENAMEX> times a year .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Some 71 %</ENAMEX> had bought some stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 57 %</ENAMEX> had sold any .
But the lurking shadow of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> 's stock - market crash still seems dark .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 33 %</ENAMEX> considered another crash `` likely , '' while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 63 %</ENAMEX> said one is `` unlikely . ''
Those percentages hardly changed from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year 's</ENAMEX> poll .
And the respondents ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 60 %</ENAMEX> of them said they would `` ordinarily '' have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 25 %</ENAMEX> of their money in stocks .
But as of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 50 %</ENAMEX> actually had stock - market investments of that size .
Most stock - market indexes were hitting all - time highs at around the time of the poll .
But it appears that many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious , rather than a signal to jump on the bandwagon .
