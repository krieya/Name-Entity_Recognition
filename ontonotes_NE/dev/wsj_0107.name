The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> passed legislation designed to make it easier for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Transportation Department</ENAMEX> to block airline leveraged buy - outs .
The final vote came after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> rejected <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> efforts to weaken the bill and approved <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> amendments sought by organized labor .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</ENAMEX> - 113 vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto .
The broader question is where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> stands on the issue .
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Commerce Committee</ENAMEX> has approved legislation similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> bill on airline leveraged buy - outs , the measure has n't yet come to the full floor .
Although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline , it is aimed at giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Transportation Department</ENAMEX> the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt .
`` The purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier 's ability to compete , '' Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Paul Hammerschmidt</ENAMEX> , -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ark .</ENAMEX> -RRB- said .
The bill , as it was approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House Public Works and Transportation Committee</ENAMEX> , would give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Transportation Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 50 days</ENAMEX> to review any purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</ENAMEX> or more of the stock in an airline .
The department would be required to block the buy - out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired ; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished ; it would be put into foreign control ; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline - related assets -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> approved an amendment offered by Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter DeFazio</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ore.</ENAMEX> -RRB- that would , in addition to the previous criteria , also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier 's employees , or their wages or benefits .
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Traficant</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> -RRB- , said the amendment , which passed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">271</ENAMEX> - 147 , would `` let the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> worker know that we consider them occasionally . ''
But Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammerschmidt</ENAMEX> said that the provision , which he dubbed a `` special interest '' amendment , was likely to make the bill even more controversial .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> approved a labor - backed amendment that would require <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Transportation Department</ENAMEX> to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code</ENAMEX> .
The provision , called the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - time - losers '' amendment by its supporters , apparently was aimed at preventing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Air Corp.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lorenzo</ENAMEX> from attempting to take over another airline .
