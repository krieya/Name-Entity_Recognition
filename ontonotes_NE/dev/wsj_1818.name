<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Associated Press 's</ENAMEX> earthquake coverage drew attention to a phenomenon that deserves some thought by public officials and other policy makers .
Private relief agencies , such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salvation Army</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Red Cross</ENAMEX> , mobilized almost instantly to help people , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> bureaucracy `` took <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</ENAMEX> getting into gear . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> news show we saw <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> even displayed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</ENAMEX> federal officials meeting around a table .
We recall that the mayor of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charleston</ENAMEX> complained bitterly about the federal bureaucracy 's response to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .
The sense grows that modern public bureaucracies simply do n't perform their assigned functions well .
