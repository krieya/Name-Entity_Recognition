I was not selected , I needed money , but unfortunately I did n't get this part - time job .
I was n't even selected for a part - time job of just eating instant noodles .
She was not selected , poor her , it seems that her boyfriend would be snatched away by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yun</ENAMEX> .
On the stage , he would be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romeo</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yun</ENAMEX> would be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juliet</ENAMEX> , the leading actress of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> department .
She had to sit in front of the stage , looking at him and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yun</ENAMEX> to play out the vicissitudes of life and the sorrow of lingering .
She would not resign to , I needed money ,
I said : Give me the money , and I will take care of that for you .
I guarantee you would sit in front of the stage , and watch the good drama , with him .
I got into the line once again , gazed by surrounding curious eyes .
Because except the judges , I was the only female there .
I was the only female competing with so many guys for acting the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romeo</ENAMEX> .
I had already lost one part - time job , I could not lose the second one .
I was so desperate , acting out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romeo</ENAMEX> 's struggle before he stabbed himself with a dagger , calling out in my heart : money , money , money , though what came out of my mouth was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juliet</ENAMEX> 's name .
Same desperation , same helplessness .
