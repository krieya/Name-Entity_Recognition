Industrial production declined <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , reinforcing other signs that the manufacturing sector continues its slowing trend .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> said output of the nation 's factories , mines and utilities expanded at an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.3 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third quarter</ENAMEX> , substantially slower than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.3 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rate in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the second quarter</ENAMEX> .
`` Capital spending and exports , which have been the driving force in this expansion , are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dederick</ENAMEX> , economist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Northern Trust Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
The new reports of sluggishness , which were foreshadowed by an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Labor Department</ENAMEX> report that manufacturing payrolls dropped by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105,000</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates .
`` They need to do something about this , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maury Harris</ENAMEX> , economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber Group Inc</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> also said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> industry operated at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83.6 %</ENAMEX> of capacity <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83.8 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> .
Measures of manufacturing activity fell more than the overall measures .
Factory output dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</ENAMEX> , its first decline since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February</ENAMEX> , after having been unchanged in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> .
Factories operated at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83.7 %</ENAMEX> of capacity , the lowest rate in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a year</ENAMEX> and down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84.1 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
The declines mainly reflected widespread weakness in durable goods , those intended to last <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than three years</ENAMEX> .
The biggest drop was recorded by primary metals producers , a category that includes the steel industry .
Output of business equipment was unchanged in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
Production of factory equipment , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> indication of the strength of manufacturers ' investment spending , fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3 %</ENAMEX> .
Some economists expect further declines in investment spending .
`` Whenever corporate profits are weak that means capital spending is going to soften subsequently , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX> said .
`` You have n't seen the full effect of that yet . ''
A decline in truck production more than offset a sharp rise in auto assemblies , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> noted .
Analysts do n't expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> surge in auto production to be repeated in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming months</ENAMEX> .
Here is a summary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve Board 's</ENAMEX> report on industrial production in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
The figures are seasonally adjusted .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">142.3 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</ENAMEX> average .
