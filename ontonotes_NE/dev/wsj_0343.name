<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> leaders traded proposals aimed at speeding action on legislation to narrow the deficit and raise the federal government 's debt limit -- but the major stumbling block remains President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's proposal to cut the capital - gains tax rate .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> want the tax provision to be a separate bill , subject to the usual procedural obstacles .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , want to try to protect the measure by combining it with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> politically popular issues that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> could find hard to block .
The talks between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> counterpart , Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dole</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> , are expected to resume <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
Last night , after meeting with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and administration officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> proposed streamlining the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> deficit - reduction bill , now stalled in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - Senate conference committee , and passing a long - term extension of the federal debt ceiling without any accompanying amendments .
Under this plan , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> provisions currently in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> version of the deficit - cutting bill -- repeal of both the catastrophic - illness insurance program and a controversial <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> tax provision intended to counter discrimination in employee - benefit plans -- would be made into a separate bill .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> would try to attach a capital - gains provision to that legislation , hoping the political popularity of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">its other two</ENAMEX> parts would dissuade <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> from blocking it .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> want to avoid having to make that choice by making the capital - gains tax cut an individual bill .
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> is confident he has sufficient votes to block such a measure with procedural actions .
Both plans would drop child - care provisions from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> version of the deficit - reduction legislation and let it progress as a separate bill .
While that could make it vulnerable to a veto by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> argue that a presidential rejection would give their party a valuable issue in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year 's</ENAMEX> congressional elections .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> are to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> to consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> proposal .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> seemed weary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration 's strategy of pushing the capital - gains measure at every chance in the face of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> procedural hurdles .
Pushing the issue on legislation needed to avoid default by the federal government , he told reporters , `` does n't seem to be very good strategy to me . ''
At <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">12:01 a.m. EST</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , the federal government 's temporary <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.87 trillion</ENAMEX> debt limit expired .
To avoid default , lawmakers must pass legislation raising the limit to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.12 trillion</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.80 trillion</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next Wednesday</ENAMEX> , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> .
Pressed by Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ill .</ENAMEX> -RRB- of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> Undersecretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Glauber</ENAMEX> told a congressional hearing that the administration would give up its demand for the capital - gains tax cut if faced with a potential default .
