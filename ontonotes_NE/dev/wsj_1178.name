Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> added that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> insurer would keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> ' headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and `` will not send <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> people to run the company . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa</ENAMEX> would also maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> ' relationships with the insurance exchanges that it manages .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> made his remarks at a breakfast meeting with reporters here <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> as part of a tour in which he is trying to rally support in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> for the proposed acquisition .
The bid is part of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX> 's unfriendly takeover attempt for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> tobacco , retailing , paper and financial - services giant that acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.2 billion</ENAMEX> .

Any acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> needs the approval of insurance commissioners in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</ENAMEX> states where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> operates , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> 's trip will take him to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> after his stay here ; he will meet with insurance regulators , legislators , industry excutives and the press .

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's insurance commissioner does n't hold hearings on acquisition applications .
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa</ENAMEX> has been rebuffed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> and has n't had any meetings with management , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> nonetheless appears to be trying to woo the company 's executives with promises of autonomy and new - found authority under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa</ENAMEX> .
He said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denlea</ENAMEX> would be a member of the top management team of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa - Midi</ENAMEX> group of companies , and would `` help define policies and strategies of the group . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> was quick <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> to point out the many negative aspects it sees in having <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa</ENAMEX> as its parent .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa</ENAMEX> plans to do away with certain tax credits that have resulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 600 million</ENAMEX> paid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> exchanges during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</ENAMEX> to offset underwriting losses .
Those credits result because of taxes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> , as the management company , has paid , and have `` proved to be very important for the exchanges , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> spokesman said .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> contended that the tax cost to the exchanges under the revised structure would be <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 8 million</ENAMEX> a year , which he described as `` peanuts .
