<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</ENAMEX> sued <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> state for age discrimination against appointed state judges .
The suit , filed in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> , charges that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York 's</ENAMEX> mandatory retirement age of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">76</ENAMEX> violates federal law .
Separately , the commission intervened in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> state judge 's age - bias suit in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Haven</ENAMEX> .
The commission 's filing in that case challenges <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> 's mandatory retirement age of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">70</ENAMEX> for appointed judges .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> suit was filed on behalf of Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Rubin</ENAMEX> , whose appointment to the state appellate division expires at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year end</ENAMEX> , and all other judges hurt by the alleged age discrimination .
The suit , assigned to federal Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimba Wood</ENAMEX> , seeks a permanent injunction , back pay for judges who have been forced to retire , reinstatement of retired judges and `` other affirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York 's</ENAMEX> -RRB- unlawful employment practices . ''
Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubin</ENAMEX> , a state judge since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</ENAMEX> , said the mandatory - retirement age hurts the court system because it deprives the state of experienced judges still capable of serving on the bench .
`` The issue is n't age -- age is just a number .
The issue is one of a judge 's experience , his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench , '' Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubin</ENAMEX> said .
`` I 've had no problems performing my duties and responsibilities . ''
Because Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubin</ENAMEX> turned <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">76</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May 9</ENAMEX> , he is n't eligible to be reappointed to the bench at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</ENAMEX> .
The suit 's impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> may be narrow , however .
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> judges are elected , and the federal age - discrimination law does n't apply to elected officials , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James L. Lee</ENAMEX> , regional attorney for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EEOC</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> law , elected judges must retire at age <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">70</ENAMEX> , but then can be appointed to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> terms until they reach <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">76</ENAMEX> .
A spokeswoman for the state 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Office of Court Administration</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the suit .
But she said the state currently has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</ENAMEX> appointed judges who are over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">70</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> , however , most state judges are appointed by the governor and approved by the state legislature .
The parties in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> case have agreed to stay proceedings pending the appeal of another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EEOC</ENAMEX> age - bias case against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX> .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX> case , a federal judge ruled that the state 's mandatory age of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">70</ENAMEX> for appointed judges was illegal ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX> 's appeal of that decision is pending before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aaron Ment</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> 's chief court administrator , declined to comment on the suit and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EEOC</ENAMEX> 's intervention .
He said the state has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">165</ENAMEX> appointed judges and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> `` trial referees , '' who are former judges over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">age 70</ENAMEX> and serve a restricted role on the bench .
ORGANIZED CRIME Strike Forces likely to be abolished <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Thornburgh</ENAMEX> 's plan to dissolve the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</ENAMEX> regional organized - crime strike forces is expected to go into effect <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</ENAMEX> , despite the opposition of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> congressional leaders and lawyers in the special units .
The units are autonomous from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorneys ' offices and focus exclusively on prosecuting organized - crime cases .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thornburgh</ENAMEX> announced his plan to abolish the units .
He says the strike - force lawyers will work more efficiently under the supervision of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorneys .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thornburgh</ENAMEX> will be free to disband the strike forces after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> approves a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 479 million</ENAMEX> appropriation for federal law - enforcement and drug - interdiction agencies , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Runkel</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justice Department</ENAMEX> spokesman .
The bill is expected to pass in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> temporarily halted Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thornburgh</ENAMEX> 's effort with an appropriation resolution that prohibited him from using budgeted funds to implement his plan .
Opponents say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thornburgh</ENAMEX> 's plan will needlessly break up longtime , tightly knit crime - fighting units that have successfully prosecuted major organized - crime figures .
They predict that organized - crime activity will increase once the units are dissolved and their responsibilities transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorneys ' offices .
Some former strike - force personnel say the units have already begun to break up .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern District</ENAMEX> unit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , lost <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> attorneys <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> partly because the lawyers were troubled by the proposed reorganization , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura A. Brevetti</ENAMEX> , who left the strike force to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Morrison Cohen Singer -AMP- Weinstein</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> law firm .
`` Those who have left have expressed an opinion that the strike force should continue , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brevetti</ENAMEX> says .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Runkel</ENAMEX> contends there has been no exodus of strike - force lawyers .
He says <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</ENAMEX> lawyers have left and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</ENAMEX> have been hired since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thornburgh</ENAMEX> announced his plan .
At the time the plan was announced , there were <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</ENAMEX> lawyers .
Some congressional leaders intend to continue to fight for independent strike forces .
A spokesman for Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward M. Kennedy</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass .</ENAMEX> -RRB- says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thornburgh</ENAMEX> would be required to reinstate the units <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> if an proposed omnibus crime bill is passed .
Among other things , the bill calls for a reorganization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> is expected to consider the bill shortly , says the senator 's spokesman .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Runkel</ENAMEX> says he doubts Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> can muster enough congressional support to reorganize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> .
`` We will vigorously oppose the bill , '' he says .
`` I do n't think -LRB- the reorganization is -RRB- going to happen . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WHITMAN -AMP- RANSOM</ENAMEX> recruits lawyers from disbanding firm :
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">204</ENAMEX> - lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> firm will bring in at least <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> partners and a not yet determined number of associates from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Golenbock -AMP- Barell</ENAMEX> , which will dissolve <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 31</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Golenbock</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</ENAMEX> lawyers , has lost several partners during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</ENAMEX> .
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Golenbock</ENAMEX> lawyers wo n't be invited to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Whitman -AMP- Ransom</ENAMEX> , according to partners at both firms .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Whitman -AMP- Ransom</ENAMEX> managing partner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maged F. Riad</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Golenbock</ENAMEX> recruits will enhance the firm 's corporate and litigation departments .
SHORT SKIRTS not welcome in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> court :
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelly Hancock</ENAMEX> , a male county court judge in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> , refused to let a woman plead guilty to a drunk - driving charge because her skirt stopped <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three inches</ENAMEX> above her knees .
The woman appeared in court <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> to enter her plea , but when she started to approach the bench , she was stopped by Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hancock</ENAMEX> .
He told the woman 's lawyer , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Blaine</ENAMEX> , that the short skirt was inappropriate for a court appearance .
Despite Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blaine</ENAMEX> 's protests , the judge rescheduled her case for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 27</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelly Siegler</ENAMEX> , an assistant district attorney who was in the courtroom , disputed suggestions the action was sexist , saying she had seen Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hancock</ENAMEX> turn away male defendants dressed in shorts , tank tops or muscle shirts `` many times . ''
Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hancock</ENAMEX> did n't return phone calls .
