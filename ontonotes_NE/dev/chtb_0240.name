<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Xinhua News Agency</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 23rd</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Association of the Relationship between the Two Sides of the Straits</ENAMEX> sent a letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Foundation for the Exchange across the Straits</ENAMEX> to exchange views on the matters of life and property loss of mainland compatriots and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> compatriots .
The communique said that on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 12th</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Straits Association</ENAMEX> director expressed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Association</ENAMEX> agreed in principle , after both sides implement necessary preparations , to exchange views about the matter of contact and exchange between both sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Straits</ENAMEX> concerning life and property loss of mainland compatriots and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> compatriots in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Straits Association</ENAMEX> holds that , now , both sides should first agree on topics and content of exchanging views , and then come back to consider issues such as staff levels and time , place , etc .
If both sides can not reach an agreement on topics and content , it would not be possible to find common points in exchanging views .
This type of discussion is not what compatriots from both sides are happy to see .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Straits Association</ENAMEX> believes that the content of the exchange of views should include :
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Firstly</ENAMEX> , to exchange views on the issues of tourism and contact on both sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Straits</ENAMEX> , including travel safety issues of compatriots from both sides .
As early as the first working discussion , at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of August of last year</ENAMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> associations implemented <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the " Wang - Gu Talks "</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Association</ENAMEX> put forward in the " schedule for the discussion on implementing relevant agreements of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Wang - Gu Talks</ENAMEX> " that the associations should conduct specific discussions about " issues on strengthening tourism and contact on both sides " as soon as possible , but so far <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Foundation 's</ENAMEX> response has not been received .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Association</ENAMEX> persistently advocates completely implementing discussions of topics about routine and economy , science and technology stipulated in the " common agreement of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Wang - Gu talks "</ENAMEX> , and has suggested many times to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Foundation</ENAMEX> that discussions on the " rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> merchants investing in the mainland and related issues " should be started early .
Our association holds that the personal and property safety of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> merchants investing in the mainland have legal safeguards , and if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Foundation</ENAMEX> felt it was needed , it could exchange views while discussing " Rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> merchants investing in the mainland and related issues " .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Thirdly</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Association</ENAMEX> has repeatedly requested that both associations should conduct consultative discussions on issues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> military killing and wounding mainland coastal fishermen and causing serious life and property losses in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
Since establishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Association</ENAMEX> , it has continuously pointed out such inhumane behavior to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Foundation</ENAMEX> which seriously hurts feelings of compatriots of both sides and breaks the harmonious atmosphere on both sides , so as to attract the attention of relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> areas on compensating for losses , finding those responsible , and severely punishing the assailants .
It has appealed to stop such violence at the root through negotiation between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> associations .
However , up to now , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Foundation 's</ENAMEX> response has not been received .
The communique clearly points out that in the above issues involving rights of compatriots of both sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Straits</ENAMEX> in contact and exchange , personal safety is included , so as for the long delay in starting discussions , the fault is not with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Association</ENAMEX> .
The communique says that current methods of contact and co-operation between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> associations must strictly follow <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the " regulation agreement of contact and talks between the two associations "</ENAMEX> signed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the " QianDao Lake Incident "</ENAMEX> occurred , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Association</ENAMEX> has , according to the agreement , reported the situation to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Foundation</ENAMEX> , explaining and answering a certain number of questions and requests brought up by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Foundation</ENAMEX> .
However , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Foundation</ENAMEX> has repeatedly raised demands that exceed the above agreement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> associations .
Despite being reminded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Association</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Foundation</ENAMEX> still repeatedly persists .
This is a practice that disrespects the agreement between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> associations .
It is continually hoped that the contact and co-operation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> associations can be conducted in accordance with the current agreement .
The communique points out that as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the " QianDao Lake Incident "</ENAMEX> is concerned , the top priority is investigating and settling the case in accordance with the law .
At the same time , to express further goodwill , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Association</ENAMEX> has proactively invited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Foundation</ENAMEX> and relevant experts to come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhejiang</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Straits Association</ENAMEX> will arrange experts ' to be presented with the details of the incident and reply to questions .
If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Foundation</ENAMEX> is willing to know the details of this case and sincerely understands the feelings of dependents of those who perished , then it is difficult to understand why it again sets up prerequisites ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Straits Association</ENAMEX> again reaffirms the above invitation , and hopes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Straits Foundation</ENAMEX> would soon provide the date of its departure and the name list .
According to relevant sources , currently , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> suspected criminals have been arrested , and a trial will soon be carried out according to legal procedure .
