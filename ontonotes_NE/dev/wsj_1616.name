Consumer prices rose a surprisingly moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , pushed up mostly by a jump in clothing costs , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Labor Department</ENAMEX> reported .
Energy costs , which drove wholesale prices up sharply during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</ENAMEX> , continued to decline at the retail level , pulling down transportation and helping to ease housing costs .
The report was the brightest news the financial markets had seen since before the stock market plunged more than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</ENAMEX> points <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Friday</ENAMEX> .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied on the news , closing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39.55</ENAMEX> points higher at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2683.20</ENAMEX> .
Bond prices also jumped as traders appeared to read the data as a sign that interest rates may fall .
But many economists were not nearly as jubilant .
The climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few months</ENAMEX> , they warned .
They also said the dollar is leveling off after a rise <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</ENAMEX> that helped to reduce the prices of imported goods .
`` I think inflation is going to pick up through the fall , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Popkin</ENAMEX> , a specialist on inflation who runs an economic consulting firm here .
`` It has been in what I would describe as a lull for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several months</ENAMEX> . ''
`` We 've had whopping declines in consumer energy prices in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each of the past three months</ENAMEX> , and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Woodworth</ENAMEX> , chief domestic economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bankers Trust Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
Because wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> , many analysts expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too .
As a result , many economists were expecting the consumer price index to increase significantly more than it did .
But retail energy prices declined <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
Though analysts say competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices , many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</ENAMEX> .
Still , some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind .
`` It increasingly appears that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987 - 88</ENAMEX> was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem , '' argued <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Yardeni</ENAMEX> , chief economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential - Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
In both <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , consumer prices rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.4 %</ENAMEX> .
A run - up in world oil prices <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last winter</ENAMEX> sent consumer prices soaring at a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.7 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rate in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first five months of this year</ENAMEX> , but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rate back down to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.4 %</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yardeni</ENAMEX> predicted that world business competition will continue to restrain prices .
`` The bottom line is , it seems to me that the economic environment has become very , very competitve for a lot of businesses , '' he said .
`` Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987 - 88</ENAMEX> , business was operating at fairly tight capacity , so businesses felt they could raise prices . ''
Now , he said , a slowdown in economic activity has slackened demand .
The mild inflation figures renewed investors ' hopes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> will ease its interest - rate stance .
The steep climb in producer prices reported <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Friday</ENAMEX> fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.9 %</ENAMEX> plunge <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several days</ENAMEX> , however , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets .
Analysts say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">makers</ENAMEX> have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy .
Excluding the volatile categories of energy and food -- leaving what some economists call the core inflation rate -- consumer prices still rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 0.2 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
Transportation costs actually fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5 %</ENAMEX> , and housing costs gained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 0.1 %</ENAMEX> .
Apparel prices rocketed up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7 %</ENAMEX> , but that was after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</ENAMEX> of declines .
Medical costs continued their steep ascent , rising <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.8 %</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four consecutive months</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7 %</ENAMEX> increases .
Car prices , another area that contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> , still showed declines at the consumer level .
They dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4 %</ENAMEX> as dealers continued to offer rebates to attract customers .
Food prices rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the second month in a row</ENAMEX> , far slower than the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> rises <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier in the year</ENAMEX> .
Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Labor Department</ENAMEX> reported that average <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> earnings rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , after adjusting for inflation , following a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7 %</ENAMEX> decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> .
All the numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations .
Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Labor Department 's</ENAMEX> consumer price index for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
