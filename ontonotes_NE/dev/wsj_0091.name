Your <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 13</ENAMEX> page - <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> story on the renewed plight of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Western Union</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Western Union</ENAMEX> had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Graham Bell 's</ENAMEX> offer to it of his invention , because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph .
Such is hardly the case .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bell</ENAMEX> 's father - in - law , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gardner G. Hubbard</ENAMEX> , wealthy and well - connected , obtained financing to start <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the American Bell Telephone Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> , which even had a subsidiary in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Telephone Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
This is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bell</ENAMEX> 's patents went .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Western Union</ENAMEX> indeed wanted to get into the telephone business .
It acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Edison 's</ENAMEX> microphone patent and then immediately sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bell Co.</ENAMEX> claiming that the microphone invented by my grandfather , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emile Berliner</ENAMEX> , which had been sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bell</ENAMEX> for a princely $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">50,000</ENAMEX> , infringed upon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Western Union 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edison</ENAMEX> patent .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bell</ENAMEX> established that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berliner</ENAMEX> patent caveat was registered <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edison</ENAMEX> 's application , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Western Union</ENAMEX> dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business -- the basis for the company 's current plight .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver Berliner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif</ENAMEX> .
