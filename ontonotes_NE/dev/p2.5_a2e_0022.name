In behavior that is strange to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> society , known for its rejection of all forms of violence , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Sports Center</ENAMEX> in the Kingdom circulated , with great pain and bitterness , an article that a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> sports forum had published for one of its members , in which he presented his plan to kill colleague <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahd Al Roqi</ENAMEX> , the sports journalist in the sister publication , " <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Al Riyadh</ENAMEX> . "
He asked for four people to help him to carry out his plan , and he explained in the forum the style of the operation in an accurate and detailed way , in addition to the weapon to be used and the assault operation .
This member had justified his threat against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Roqi</ENAMEX> as the result of the suppression of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nasrawi</ENAMEX> fans of the injustice inflicted upon them , and of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Roqi 's</ENAMEX> statements towards them , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Al - Hilali</ENAMEX> media flipping the facts in its team 's favor , which harms the interests of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Nasr</ENAMEX> , and what happened in the match between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Hilal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Nasr</ENAMEX> in terms of events and unfair refereeing favoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Nasr</ENAMEX> - as he stated .
The colleague , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Roqi</ENAMEX> , refused to comment on this issue on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the " kooorah " website</ENAMEX> , asserting that he constantly receives threats via mobile text messages or unknown calls .
For their part , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> crowds expressed through their forums their rejection of such things , calling for enthusiasm and reactions not to be accepted and threatening people 's lives due to football games , the goal of which is to entertain the youth and create honorable competition .
The question that arises , is what is happening a beginning of sport riots that might develop into something with bad repercussions ?
And who is responsible for such matters ?
The club administrations and the media should stand firm against those who want to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> sports backwards .
