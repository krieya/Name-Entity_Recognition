Pension funds , insurers and other behemoths of the investing world said they began scooping up stocks during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's market rout .
And they plan to buy more <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
Rightly or wrongly , many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1987</ENAMEX> crash : Buying at the bottom pays off .
To be sure , big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
They could still panic and bail out of the market .
But their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse .
`` Last time , we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John W. Rogers</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ariel Capital Management Inc.</ENAMEX> , which manages <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 billion</ENAMEX> of stocks .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers</ENAMEX> spent half his cash on hand <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> for `` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart . ''
He expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> - based portfolio manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Craig</ENAMEX> was n't daunted when <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's rout shaved <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</ENAMEX> from the value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 752 million</ENAMEX> Janus Fund he oversees .
`` I waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through , '' he said .
Then he jumped into the market :
`` I spent <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the last half - hour</ENAMEX> . ''
Other money managers also opened their wallets .
`` I was buying at the close -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> -RRB- and I 'll be buying again because I know we 're getting good value , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick A. Moran</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moran Asset Management Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenwich</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Conn</ENAMEX> .
`` There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash . ''
Unlike mutual funds , which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money , big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock .
Most often , they do just that , because stocks have proved to be the best - performing long - term investment , attracting <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 trillion</ENAMEX> from pension funds alone .
`` If you bought after the crash , you did very very well off the bottom , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen B. Timbers</ENAMEX> , chief investment officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kemper Financial Services Inc</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 56 billion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">California Public Employees Retirement System</ENAMEX> , for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> , added <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> to its stock portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> .
`` The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long - term holders , and that they ca n't react to short - term events , good or bad , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen L. Nesbitt</ENAMEX> , senior vice president for the pension consultants <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wilshire Associates</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Monica</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif</ENAMEX> .
`` Those that pulled out -LRB- of stocks -RRB- regretted it , '' he said , `` so I doubt you 'll see any significant changes '' in institutional portfolios as a result of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's decline .
Stocks , as measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Standard -AMP- Poor 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> - stock index , have been stellar performers <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , rising <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27.97 %</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's plunge , excluding dividends .
Even <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's slump leaves investors ahead <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</ENAMEX> , well above the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> average for stocks over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several decades</ENAMEX> .
`` You could go down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</ENAMEX> points and still have <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a good year</ENAMEX> in the market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James D. Awad</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BMI Capital Corp</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Awad</ENAMEX> , however , worries that the market `` could go down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</ENAMEX> points in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few days</ENAMEX> .
It can happen before you can turn around . ''
He said he discerns many parallels with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading .
`` The only thing you do n't have , '' he said , `` is the ` portfolio insurance ' phenomenon overlaid on the rest . ''
Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique , which is widely thought to have worsened the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash .
Not really insurance , this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">S-AMP-P</ENAMEX> futures contracts .
In its severest test , the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 60 billion</ENAMEX> of portfolio insurance in effect in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash did n't work , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected .
Even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were grim <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , money managers said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Weisman</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chilmark Capital Partners</ENAMEX> had converted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 220 million</ENAMEX> investment pool to cash in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</ENAMEX> , said he was besieged by Wall Street firms <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> asking him to take stock off their hands .
`` We got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weisman</ENAMEX> , who , happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier , declined the offers .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weisman</ENAMEX> predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few days</ENAMEX> before declining again , trapping more investors .
`` I think it will be a rigor mortis rally , '' he said .
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally .
Especially gleeful were the short sellers , who have been pounded by this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> 's market climb .
The shorts sell borrowed shares , hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price .
The nation 's largest short - selling operation is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Feshbach Brothers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , which said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last May</ENAMEX> that its short positions had shown losses of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</ENAMEX> up to that point .
All that now has changed .
`` We 're ahead for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</ENAMEX> because of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , '' said the firm 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Feshbach</ENAMEX> .
`` We 're not making a killing , but we had <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a good day</ENAMEX> .
