In a blow to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rafale</ENAMEX> jet fighter , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> navy for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time publicly stated its desire to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F - 18 Hornets</ENAMEX> to defend its aircraft carriers .
The statement is likely to sharpen the debate within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> 's military establishment over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rafale</ENAMEX> , which is made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Avions Marcel Dassault - Breguet Aviation SA</ENAMEX> .
In an interview in the navy 's official <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cols Bleus</ENAMEX> , the navy 's second - in - command , Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yves Goupil</ENAMEX> , said the navy still intends to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rafales</ENAMEX> as scheduled in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1990s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early 21st century</ENAMEX> .
The air force is to take <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 250</ENAMEX> more .
Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX> said the navy ca n't wait until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> , when the naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rafale</ENAMEX> becomes available , to replace its obsolete fleet of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> - made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX> , used since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</ENAMEX> to protect carriers from attack .
Rather than renovate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX> , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dassault</ENAMEX> is proposing to do for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 1.8 billion French francs</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 286.6 million</ENAMEX> -RRB- , Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX> said the navy wants to buy used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F - 18s</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Navy</ENAMEX> .
Officially , the statement is n't an attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rafale</ENAMEX> .
Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX> said that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the F - 18s</ENAMEX> wear out , the navy is prepared to take <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rafales</ENAMEX> to replace them .
But unofficially , senior navy officials sharply criticize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rafale</ENAMEX> as an air force plane ill - suited to carrier use .
Although they never said so publicly , they have made no secret of their preference for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the F - 18</ENAMEX> on operational grounds .
Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX> 's comments are likely to inflame the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dassault</ENAMEX> .
Although government - controlled , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dassault</ENAMEX> still is run by the founder 's son , Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serge Dassault</ENAMEX> , who has fiercely protected his company 's independence .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rafale</ENAMEX> project is the result of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> 's inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs .
So far , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dassault</ENAMEX> has resisted pressure to change .
What brought the naval issue to a head is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX> are literally falling apart , without any immediate plan to replace them .
Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusader</ENAMEX> squadron leader , said that the last other country to use <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> , retired its last ones <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusader</ENAMEX> crash <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months ago</ENAMEX> heightened pressure for new planes here .
Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX> rejected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dassault</ENAMEX> 's proposal to renovate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX> , saying the cost was impossible to estimate .
Even modernized , he said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX> represent an obsolete and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> has sent to meet such crises as the wars in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Defense</ENAMEX> Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean - Pierre Chevenement</ENAMEX> told a meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Anglo - American Press Association</ENAMEX> that the question of modernizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX> or buying used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F18s</ENAMEX> is a `` political '' decision that he will make in due time .
