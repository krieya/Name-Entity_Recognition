In search of buyers for upscale department - store chains such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bloomingdale 's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> , investment bankers are turning to -- who else ? The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> .
But so far <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's cash - rich retailers are proving to be cautious shoppers .
`` We have the money to buy .
But operating a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> department - store chain would be very difficult , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Motoyuki Homma</ENAMEX> , managing director of the international division at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsukoshi Ltd.</ENAMEX> , one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's leading department stores .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> retail executives say the main reason they are reluctant to jump into the fray in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> is that -- unlike manufacturing -- retailing is extremely sensitive to local cultures and life styles .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> have watched the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Europeans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadians</ENAMEX> stumble in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> market , and they fret that business practices that have won them huge profits at home wo n't translate into success in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> department stores are also wary of attracting negative publicity .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony Corp. 's</ENAMEX> recent headline - grabbing acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> , many say it makes good political sense to lie low .
`` It 's a question of timing , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayumi Takayama</ENAMEX> , managing director of international operations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Isetan Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> department store .
Still , for those with a long - term eye on the vast <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> retail market , this is a tempting time to look for bargains .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX> is trying to unwind its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> retailing operations , which include such well - known stores as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Marshall Field 's</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Breuners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ivey 's</ENAMEX> .
And debt - ridden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campeau Corp. of Toronto</ENAMEX> is giving up the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> - store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bloomingdale 's</ENAMEX> group .
`` Every department store in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> is taking a look , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Allen</ENAMEX> , a retail analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Barclay 's de Zoete Wedd Securities -LRB- Japan -RRB- Ltd</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> , however , does n't think that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> is about to embark on a major buying binge .
Nonetheless , speculation heated up <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tokyu Department Store Co.</ENAMEX> confirmed a report in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nihon Keizai Shimbun</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's leading business daily , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tokyu</ENAMEX> is talking with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campeau</ENAMEX> about buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bloomingdale 's</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tokyu</ENAMEX> , however , said no agreement had been reached .
Nor is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tokyu</ENAMEX> the only <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> retailer interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bloomingdale 's</ENAMEX> , which bankers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> estimate could cost <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 1 billion and $ 1.5 billion</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> department - store groups were approached by investment bankers representing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bloomingdale 's</ENAMEX> chairman , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Traub</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</ENAMEX> are seeking additional information on the group , bankers say .
What Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traub</ENAMEX> is hoping to put together , investment bankers say , is a management - led group to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> department - store group that he heads from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campeau 's Federated Department Stores</ENAMEX> subsidiary .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federated</ENAMEX> ran into a cash crunch after it was acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX> , which relied heavily on debt to finance the transaction .
Paying off that debt put such a squeeze on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campeau</ENAMEX> and its stores that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federated</ENAMEX> decided to sell off the jewels of its retailing empire , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bloomingdale 's</ENAMEX> .
Hoping to avoid another takeover , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traub</ENAMEX> retained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blackstone Group</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> to help him find partners for a management - led buy - out .
Ideally , investment bankers say , he wants to get backing from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> department store and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> department store to forge a global retailing network .
`` When you look at the economics , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traub</ENAMEX> needs a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> partner to make it work , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> investment banker who follows the retail industry .
`` Looking only at a narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> strategy is n't where it 's at . ''
Persuading tradition - bound <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> retailers to get involved in the turmoils of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> retailing industry is n't likely to be so easy , analysts say .
Up until now , most stores have followed the same basic overseas strategy :
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> they set up overseas merchandising offices to import items and track new fashion trends .
Then they opened small gift shops mostly aimed at <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> tourists .
Reluctant to advance further on their own , some stores have settled for tie - ups with famous specialty shops .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last March</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Isetan</ENAMEX> invested <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5 billion yen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.6 million</ENAMEX> -RRB- in a venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Barney 's Inc.</ENAMEX> , an up - scale <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> specialty clothier .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Barney 's</ENAMEX> shop is scheduled to open in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsukoshi</ENAMEX> recently increased its equity stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tiffany -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</ENAMEX> .
Through the longstanding relationship between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> companies , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsukoshi</ENAMEX> has opened <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tiffany</ENAMEX> shops in its stores and arcades in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
Plans are under way to open a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tiffany 's</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> to cater to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> tourists ; it will be run mostly by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsukoshi</ENAMEX> .
Some industry observers say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsukoshi</ENAMEX> 's classy image makes it a possible match for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> .
Company officials say they are studying various proposals but wo n't discuss details .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Takashimaya Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's oldest department store , is another name that keeps popping up as a potential fit with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saks</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eiji Nakazato</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Takashimaya</ENAMEX> general manager , admits that his company 's image is similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saks</ENAMEX> 's and that there is some interest in the idea .
But he stops there .
`` We 'd like to do business in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
`` But it looks tough . ''

It said the regular <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> deficit amounted to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 43.5 million</ENAMEX> , based on revenue of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 74.4 million</ENAMEX> and expenses of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 117.9 million</ENAMEX> .

The statement said a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> jump in the `` Peter 's Pence '' collection -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> offering from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Catholics</ENAMEX> to the pope -- helped cover the deficit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Council</ENAMEX> member <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardinal Gerald Carter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vatican Radio</ENAMEX> : `` Now that we say we covered our deficit <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , people are going to relax and say well that 's fine , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Holy See</ENAMEX> is out of the hole .

According to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> 's office , `` This is solely a fact - finding trip .

<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> postal authorities say they have uncovered a large - scale scheme where unscrupulous stamp dealers chemically removed stamp cancellations , regummed the stamps and sold them to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> collectors or , in large lots , to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> businesses .
