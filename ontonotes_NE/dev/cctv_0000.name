In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 2005</ENAMEX> , a picture that people have long been looking forward to started emerging with frequency in various major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> media .
With their unique charm , these well - known cartoon images once again caused <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> to be a focus of worldwide attention .
The world 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Disney</ENAMEX> park will soon open to the public here .
The most important thing about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Disney</ENAMEX> is that it is a global brand .
Well , for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</ENAMEX> , although it was still under construction and , er , not yet open , it can be said that many people have viewed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> with new respect .
Then welcome to the official writing ceremony of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hong Kong Disneyland</ENAMEX> .
The construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hong Kong Disneyland</ENAMEX> began <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January of that year</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> government turned over to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Disney Corporation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 hectares</ENAMEX> of land at the foot of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Lantau Island</ENAMEX> that was obtained following the largest land reclamation project in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> .
Since then , this area has become a prohibited zone in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
As its neighbor on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Lantau Island</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hong Kong International Airport</ENAMEX> had to change its flight routes to make this area a no - fly zone .
Mickey Mouse 's new home , settling on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> land for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time , has captured worldwide attention .
There 's only <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</ENAMEX> left before the opening of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hong Kong Disneyland</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 12</ENAMEX> .
The subway to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disney</ENAMEX> has already been constructed .
At subway stations , passengers will frequently press the station for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disney</ENAMEX> on ticket machines , trying to purchase tickets to enjoy the park when it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> opens .
Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disney</ENAMEX> subway station is scheduled to open on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</ENAMEX> as the park .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Disney</ENAMEX> has constantly maintained its mystery .
No media have been allowed to enter for photos .
We took a taxi along the path of the highway that heads toward <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disney</ENAMEX> , trying to experience this mysterious park from close by .
However , before any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Disney</ENAMEX> symbols were in sight , the car was stopped by a security guard at the intersection of the road towards <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Disney</ENAMEX> .
On our way back , the taxi driver gave us an explanation after understanding our intentions .
Er , according to what the security guard said , for the time before everything is officially opened , opened , all , no cars can enter unless they have special permission .
No one can enter otherwise .
Video recording is especially forbidden .
Ah , everything is top secret .
If pictures are taken without permission , %pw that is to say , it will at all times be pursued by legal action , a big hassle .
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Disney Corporation</ENAMEX> chose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> as the venue for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disney</ENAMEX> park , what they are actually most excited about is the mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> tourist market .
Since the implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Individual Visit Scheme</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and the mainland , more and more mainland tourists are coming to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
From the beginning up till now , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than seven million</ENAMEX> individual tourists have , have come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
Well , we now , er , believe more will be coming .
At this point , it has been <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years</ENAMEX> .
Also , the current number of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</ENAMEX> cities will be increased .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> was developed from a fishing harbor <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one hundred years ago</ENAMEX> to become <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's international metropolis .
Here , eastern and western cultures have gathered , and the new and the old coexist .
When in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , you can wander among skyscrapers , heartily enjoy shopping sprees in well - known stores and malls for goods from various countries , and taste delicious snacks from all over the world at tea shops or at street stands in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mong Kok</ENAMEX> .
You can go to burn incense and make a vow at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Repulse Bay</ENAMEX> , where all deities gather .
You can enjoy the most charming sun - filled sandy beaches in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
You can ascend <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Victoria Peak</ENAMEX> to get a panoramic view of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Victoria Harbor 's</ENAMEX> beautiful scenery .
Or hop onto a trolley with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">over a century</ENAMEX> of history , and feel the city 's blend of the old and the modern in slow motion .
After dark , cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Victoria Harbor</ENAMEX> at night to enjoy the enchanting evening view .
Every corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is filled with fun .
Meanwhile , as various new items are constantly being added , what other kinds of pleasant surprises will the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> tourism industry bring us ?
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 28 years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Ocean Park</ENAMEX> has basically been a must - see destination for tourists coming to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
Watch spectacular performances by dolphins and sea lions at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Ocean Theater</ENAMEX> , and experience passionate screaming and accelerating heart - beat adventures on amusement rides .
Or ride the giant Ferris wheel to get a bird 's eye view from high above of the magnificent panorama of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Hong Kong Island</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the South China Sea</ENAMEX> .
These items , which were the pride of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Ocean Park</ENAMEX> , have made this place the most popular tourist attraction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> for some time .
However , since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Disney</ENAMEX> entered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ocean Park</ENAMEX> , sharing the same city as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Disney</ENAMEX> , has felt the pressure of competition .
To improve the park 's brand , they are planning to invest <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.5 billion</ENAMEX> in a renovation project starting in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</ENAMEX> .
It seems that for the future , we have a scheme , a major renovation plan .
That is , the entire park will be divided into seven sections for renovation .
Ah , additional , newer , ah , attractions will be available for tourists .
It seems that those attractions like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the North Pole</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Marine Life Center</ENAMEX> will also be renovated after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</ENAMEX> .
Are they going to be different from what they are now ?
They will be , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</ENAMEX> .
Ah , there will be more animals , and more animal species , different from what there is now .
It looks like we will also bring in whales .
Er , we will implement this plan as soon as it is approved by the government .
Groundbreaking is expected to start <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
Yes .
The area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is only <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one thousand - plus square kilometers</ENAMEX> .
The population is dense .
Natural resources are relatively scarce .
However , the clever <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> people will utilize all resources they have created for developing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> tourism industry .
Among these is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Avenue of Stars</ENAMEX> .
Entering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> ,
here , you can come up close with the stars in your mind .
He is my .
She is my Goddess , ah .
Please stay with us on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New World Travel</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> has always worn the crown of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 100 years</ENAMEX> of film history , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> cinema has nurtured many internationally renowned directors , actors , and screenwriters .
They have shortened the distance between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and the world .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> movies have even become a window for the world to see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , which have made the image of metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> more prominent internationally .
For this reason , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</ENAMEX> , on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Waterfront Promenade</ENAMEX> originally constructed for viewing only the scenery of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Hong Kong Island</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Victoria Harbor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Hong Kong Tourism Board</ENAMEX> also constructed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Avenue of Stars</ENAMEX> , memorializing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">100 - year</ENAMEX> film history .
Here , tourists can learn about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> film history , and can come up close with the stars in their mind .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is a busy metropolis .
Even at dusk , the city 's pulse never stops beating .
Across from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Avenue of Stars</ENAMEX> , a special performance is staged every weekend .
%pw As our <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Victoria Harbor</ENAMEX> is %pw very famous , and , er , our nightscape is already very beautiful , by what means could we enhance the dynamic beauty of our nightscape ?
So , one idea was to transform <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Victoria Harbor</ENAMEX> into a performance stage .
Er , each key building is like a performer .
It is based on this that music and lights are arranged to reflect each other and perform a unique , er , and fascinating multi-media world - class light show .
Let me now introduce to you all the well - known skyscrapers participating in this large - scale light and music show .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">The PLA Hong Kong Garrison Plaza</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bank of China Tower</ENAMEX> , at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00</ENAMEX> every Saturday night , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">HSBC Main Building</ENAMEX> .
Their performances will be on schedule .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Center of the East Central .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</ENAMEX> landmark buildings located on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Hong Kong Island</ENAMEX> reveal themselves <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> , participating in the show in full splendor , presenting a world - class light extravaganza to a musical rhythm .
Whenever there is a major event or holiday , fireworks are also added to the light show .
Some , er , cities have consulted with us .
Uh-huh .
Their area of surprise was that those private , er , buildings , that is , the business community , ah , is willing to invest in our overall project .
Yes .
The answer is that this is a reward to the entire society , not an individual building 's reward .
Er , of course , after SARS , we felt that all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> hopes to be involved , so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> tourism industry will recover , rebound together with other sectors .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hong Kong Wetland Park</ENAMEX> , which is currently under construction , is also one of the designated new projects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong SAR</ENAMEX> government for advancing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> tourism industry .
This is a park intimately connected with nature , being built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> government for its people who live in a city of reinforced concrete .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hong Kong Wetland Park</ENAMEX> covers an area of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">61 hectares</ENAMEX> , including a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10,000 square meter</ENAMEX> visitor 's center and a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 hectare</ENAMEX> outdoor wildlife habitat .
In the indoor exhibition hall , tourists can learn about types of wetlands in various parts of the world , and to gain knowledge about wetlands .
Outdoors , they can also personally experience wetland ecology .
At the highest point of Hong Kong , er , from the highest point we can see <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> different ecological environments .
Ha , on that side are many tall buildings , that is , towns with lots of people living there ,
but behind me is our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wetland Park</ENAMEX> .
Ha , entirely different .
Quite primitive ,
er , a fresh water swamp ,
er , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Wetland Park Exploration Center</ENAMEX> .
Lastly , farthest away you can see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Putian</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shenzhen</ENAMEX> .
Then , the bridge is , on the bridge is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and outside is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shenzhen</ENAMEX> .
You can come into intimate contact with nature in the outdoor wetland environment .
Children can get to know different animals and plants , and even some crops that are rarely seen in our daily life .
Over here are paddy fields , which is rather unique .
Ha , there are aquatic plants inside .
Ah , the most special is rice , because %pw many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> children nowadays have never seen what rice looks like .
Look over there .
They are going to be ripe soon .
The long one over there .
Oh .
Yes .
With , with ears , ah .
Where ?
Ah , here .
Perhaps there will be an introduction so that children will know the names of the crops when they see them .
Let , let them get some understanding .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mai Po Marshes</ENAMEX> adjacent to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wetland Park</ENAMEX> is a major wildlife habitat within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> .
Each year , over <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</ENAMEX> migratory birds fly over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here .
As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> different types of aviaries were built in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hong Kong Wetland Park</ENAMEX> .
These have become the best spots to observe birds .
Among common birds , a rather special one is the black - faced spoonbill .
It is an endangered bird species throughout the world .
Uh-huh .
Ah , there are only about <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</ENAMEX> in the world .
Wow .
Um , however , each year , about <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to three hundred</ENAMEX> of them come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> to spend the winter .
Some of them , er , have stayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hong Kong Wetland Park</ENAMEX> .
Uh-huh .
So , our park 's logo is unique , featuring this black - faced spoonbill , which hopefully can draw people 's attention .
Uh-huh .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wetland Park</ENAMEX> workers are now in the middle of intensive work .
They will complete the park 's entire construction by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of 2006</ENAMEX> , to be able to participate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Discover Hong Kong Year</ENAMEX> campaign .
Ah , we have established <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2006</ENAMEX> as Discover Hong Kong Year .
Why is that ?
Because , as everyone knows , our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disneyland</ENAMEX> will open in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September of this year</ENAMEX> .
In addition , we will have <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ngong Ping 360</ENAMEX> , that is , the cable car , er , to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Giant Buddha</ENAMEX> .
They add to what we already have , like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Avenue of Stars</ENAMEX> , which is also very famous .
Moreover , er , we are including our software .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> software is very well known .
Like what 's used in our <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Symphony of Lights</ENAMEX> .
We hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Discover Hong Kong Year</ENAMEX> .
Without planning it in advance , they chose to settle here .
A dream that has been anticipated for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than twenty years</ENAMEX> will soon come true here .
Because your line connects us with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> --
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> tourist attractions have gradually moved from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Hong Kong Island</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kowloon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the New Territory</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> new attractions participating in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Discover Hong Kong Year</ENAMEX> are located on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Lantau Island</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the New Territory</ENAMEX> .
For this reason , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Lantau Island</ENAMEX> has become a new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> tourism popular spot .
The earliest to settle here was this world 's largest outdoor seated bronze <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Buddha</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Buddhism</ENAMEX> , there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> directions - east , west , south , north , and center - and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Buddhas</ENAMEX> .
Therefore , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tian Tan Giant Buddha</ENAMEX> at the most southern tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , together with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lingshan Giant Buddha</ENAMEX> in the east , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Leshan Giant Buddha</ENAMEX> in the west , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Yungang Giant Buddha</ENAMEX> in the north , and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Longmen Giant Buddha</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Central Plains</ENAMEX> , exist as the representative <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Buddhas</ENAMEX> for each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> directions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
As a result , this place has become holy land in the hearts of male and female devotees .
However , to common tourists , more of what this place brings them is wonder and awe .
Since this giant bronze <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Buddha</ENAMEX> settled on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Lantau Island</ENAMEX> , the world renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hong Kong International Airport</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chek Lap Kok</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disneyland</ENAMEX> have also been constructed here in succession .
The important status of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Lantau Island</ENAMEX> is increasingly apparent .
No , it was totally inaccessible in the past .
In the near future , construction will also begin on a cross-sea bridge connecting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhuhai</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macao</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> --
Could n't go in summer --
So , after their return , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macao</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> special administrative regions , are basically still using ships and helicopters to stay connected .
It 's extremely troublesome to get there via land .
One has to go up to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shenzhen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dongguan</ENAMEX> , then go through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panyu</ENAMEX> , keep going up , to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhongshan</ENAMEX> , and certainly go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhuhai</ENAMEX> , then pass through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhuhai</ENAMEX> to get to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macao</ENAMEX> .
For a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> person choosing to go there via land , it 's extremely inconvenient .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A full twenty years ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hopewell Holdings Group</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Ying - sheung</ENAMEX> , a well - known construction tycoon , boldly made a cross-sea bridge proposal .
With this bridge , the distance would be very small , only <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a little over one kilometer</ENAMEX> .
However , due to various reasons , bridge construction was put off .
This is what we have seen since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</ENAMEX> .
Anticipated for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</ENAMEX> , today this dream is finally coming true .
Well , originally the construction of the new --
With this new Hong Kong - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhuhai</ENAMEX> - Macao bridge that basically leads to all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">three</ENAMEX> places , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macao</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhuhai</ENAMEX> , basically , at the start of the bridge , you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macao</ENAMEX> is this way , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhuhai</ENAMEX> is this way .
From the perspective of either <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macao</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhuhai</ENAMEX> , our concept is a tourism zone .
Er , %pw <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhuhai</ENAMEX> for sightseeing tours , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macao</ENAMEX> for entertainment , and we have <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disneyland</ENAMEX> and other , other attractions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
Each place has different attractions of its own .
So , with this bridge , when some old friends , friends from mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> or from foreign countries come to our place , it seems they can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several days , before , ha , going home .
Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhuhai</ENAMEX> - Hong Kong - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macao</ENAMEX> bridge is built , it will no longer be a dream of tourists to enjoy gourmet food in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macao</ENAMEX> before having fun at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disneyland</ENAMEX> just <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour later</ENAMEX> .
Promotion of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hong Kong Disneyland</ENAMEX> has long since begun .
However , even though it has entered the last countdown period before its final opening , this wonderland is still unwilling to take off its mysterious veil .
Ah , currently it has been decided that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disney</ENAMEX> will open on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 12</ENAMEX> .
There 's also what we call soft opening .
Ah , they are now rehearsing .
Ah , different , ah , some groups , they are rehearsing their service , well , hoping that they will become used to the service , be familiar with it , when our tourists come in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
Well , I am very confident , that when our tourists come to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disneyland</ENAMEX> , they will certainly return home very satisfied .
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">The Wonder Tour</ENAMEX> will start from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
This dynamic metropolis never ceases its movement .
It continues to explore ; it continues to open new worlds .
Each day , there is always something new for people to experience and to love about this city .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is a world famous shopping paradise .
What determined the position of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> as a shopping paradise ?
