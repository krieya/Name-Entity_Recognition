Hospital Regulation Sparks <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> Feud
WHICH IS the best medicine for runaway health costs : competition or regulation ?
The question is at the root of a brawl between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Humana Inc.</ENAMEX> , the big for - profit hospital and insurance company , and its not - for - profit brethren in its home state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> .
The battle focuses on the state 's certificate - of - need law , which regulates investment in new medical technology .
The law has prevented <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 216 million</ENAMEX> of unnecessary expenditures since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William S. Conn</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Kentucky Hospital Association</ENAMEX> .
But according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Jones</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Humana</ENAMEX> 's chief executive , it promotes technology monopolies , stifles innovation and raises prices .
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Legislature</ENAMEX> does n't repeal the law , due for revision in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Humana</ENAMEX> may move its insurance operations , including <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</ENAMEX> jobs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisville</ENAMEX> , to another state .
The company complains that it paid <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG" S_OFF="4">non-Humana</ENAMEX> hospitals in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">its latest fiscal year</ENAMEX> for services provided to its insurance plan members .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Humana</ENAMEX> says its own facilities could serve its insured for less if they were properly equipped .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conn</ENAMEX> charges that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Humana</ENAMEX> 's own actions undermine its argument .
When a hospital in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lexington</ENAMEX> installed a lithotripter <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , demand for a similar kidney - stone smashing machine at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Humana</ENAMEX> hospital in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisville</ENAMEX> fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34 %</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Humana</ENAMEX> hospital responded by jacking up prices to make up for lost revenue , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conn</ENAMEX> says , and now charges <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 8,000</ENAMEX> for the procedure , which costs <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only about $ 3,500</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lexington</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Humana</ENAMEX> contends that $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">8,000</ENAMEX> represents an extreme case and that its regular charge for lithotripsy is $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4,900</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , another hospital 's proposal for a new - generation lithotripter is pending before the board that administers the certificate - of - need law .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Humana</ENAMEX> , which wants to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the new machines itself , is on the record as opposed to the proposal .
Debt - Burdened Doctors Seek Financial Security
HEALTH - CARE experts have long worried that young doctors emerging from medical school with a mountain of debt will choose careers in high - paying specialties instead of primary care , where more physicians are needed most .
Now there 's a new wrinkle in what young doctors want : <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</ENAMEX> residents responding to recent survey said they 'd prefer a guaranteed salary over traditional fee - for - service compensation in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> professional position .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81 %</ENAMEX> preferred a group practice or health maintenance organization , while just <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</ENAMEX> favored solo practice .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Ten years ago</ENAMEX> , a physician would go to a town and take out a loan -LRB- to start a practice -RRB- , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Merritt</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merritt , Hawkins -AMP- Associates</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Irvine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , physician recruiter that conducted the survey .
`` They wo n't do that very often <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> at all .
They 're looking for something that 's very safe . ''
The numbers behind such fears : The average debt of medical school graduates who borrowed to pay for their education jumped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">42,374</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> from $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">38,489</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Association of American Medical Colleges</ENAMEX> .
That 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">115 %</ENAMEX> more than in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> .
Money is n't the only reason for the shift in practice preferences .
It reflects values of a generation that wants more time for families and personal interests , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John H. Moxley III</ENAMEX> , who directs physician - executive searches for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Korn / Ferry International</ENAMEX> .
`` This is a change in the social fabric of medicine , '' he says .
Related Roommates Trim Hospital Bills
WHEN <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Bobar</ENAMEX> spent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Medical Center of Vermont</ENAMEX> recently with a bone infection in her toe , she shared a room just like most patients .
But unlike most patients , her roommate was her husband .
`` It was certainly good to have him handy , '' Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobar</ENAMEX> says .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> - bed `` cooperative care '' unit is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 18</ENAMEX> nationwide where a family member or friend helps care for a patient in the hospital .
`` The philosophy is to make the patient and the family very responsible for a portion of their own care , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony J. Grieco</ENAMEX> , medical director of cooperative care at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New York University Medical Center</ENAMEX> , where the concept began <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years ago</ENAMEX> .
`` It helps us , and them , while they 're here , and it certainly makes them a better health - care team when they get home . ''
It also saves money .
Because patients require less attention from nurses and other staff , room charges are lower -- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 100 less</ENAMEX> per day than a regular room at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX> hospital .
Cancer patients needing prolonged radiation therapy , diabetics learning to manage their blood sugar levels , and cardiac bypass patients are among those who spend time on cooperative - care units .
The approach has generated so much interest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NYU</ENAMEX> is host to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> conference on cooperative care <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 30</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's really part of the hospital of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</ENAMEX> , '' Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grieco</ENAMEX> says .
Odds and Ends
THE CHIEF NURSING officer can be responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,000</ENAMEX> employees and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one - third</ENAMEX> of a hospital 's budget ; a head nurse typically oversees <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 80</ENAMEX> employees and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 million</ENAMEX> .
So says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commonwealth Fund</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> philanthropist that 's sponsoring a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</ENAMEX> project to develop joint masters in business and nursing programs at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> universities ... .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Meharry Medical College</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nashville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenn.</ENAMEX> , launches a new research publication in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Journal on Health Care for the Poor and Underserved</ENAMEX> .
