A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> newspaper revealed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> had planned to bomb the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> .
Was this a joke told by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> or was it a long - meditated threat ?
Did <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> know nothing about it , or did he succeed in persuading his ally to give up the idea of attacks ?
What exactly is the truth ?
Why can a TV station in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> country have <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> on pins and needles ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Focus Today</ENAMEX> is coming up in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a minute</ENAMEX> .
Hello , dear viewers , welcome to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Focus Today</ENAMEX> .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November 22</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daily Mirror</ENAMEX> revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> once planned to bomb the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station headquarters , setting off a mighty uproar .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> nationals charged with leaking the information already appeared in court for interrogation <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time .
According to a report by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> newspaper the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Guardian</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station is now considering suing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> for this matter .
Well , what exactly was this incident ?
Why has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station become a thorn in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's side ?
These are all the topics we will be focusing on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> honorable guests have been invited to our studio .
Let me give you an introduction .
One is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruan Zongze</ENAMEX> , vice director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the China Institute of International Studies</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruan Zongze</ENAMEX> has done extensive researches on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> issues .
The other is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Huixuan</ENAMEX> , former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIR</ENAMEX> chief correspondent based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> .
Hello !
Welcome you <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> to the studio for our interview .
Well , at the start of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's program , let 's learn about the full context of this incident together .
We will <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> talk about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daily Mirror</ENAMEX> article that started it .
What we are seeing now on screen is a very popular newspaper in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Daily Mirror</ENAMEX> .
Next , let 's see ; this is a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November 22</ENAMEX> article .
The title goes like this :
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Exclusive report : Bush Planned to Bomb his Arab Ally</ENAMEX>
Well , let 's now look at the content of the article .
The article writes that the minutes of a meeting between <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> , who was visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 16 , 2004</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> had intended to take military actions against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station headquartered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Qatari</ENAMEX> capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Doha</ENAMEX> .
Then , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> said to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> that such an action would trigger a worldwide uproar .
These are some records of the conversation between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> men .
Let 's now look at this article .
A paragraph in the article writes -- let 's look at this line marked with a black frame , which writes : Undoubtedly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> wanted to do this .
And equally without doubt , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> did not want him , that is , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , to do this .
Well , it happened , er , that our correspondent did an interview at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the al - Jazeera 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> office <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> and happened to videotape the image we are watching now , which was broadcast live by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
It was the news about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's plan to bomb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
So what we are seeing on screen was exactly transmitted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
Well , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> the two <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> nationals involved in the disclosure of the incident were interrogated by the court .
Well , here is the scene of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> persons under interrogation .
In the meantime , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station also protested several times upon learning the information .
Well , this is a brief introduction of the context of the incident .
Well , regarding this topic , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> question <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> is that we want to find out clearly whether this incident was real or not .
Let 's start with this newspaper .
Well , Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuan</ENAMEX> , I know that you also once worked in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> .
Well , what kind of newspaper is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Daily Mirror</ENAMEX> ?
It is said to have a very large circulation , but people still call it a tabloid .
So how accurate is the news carried by it ?
This is true .
Its circulation should be considered <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the largest among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> newspapers .
Uh-huh .
But at the same time , interestingly , it is not a mainstream newspaper , either .
Uh-huh .
That is why it is called a tabloid , because it does not belong to the mainstream in the current <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> newspaper industry .
It is still called a tabloid .
It is placed together with other city newspapers , yet it is also a newspaper of national circulation with an extremely powerful influence .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Its influence is mainly on ordinary readers , the general public .
That 's because most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> newspapers have their own steady readership .
They have different levels of readership , ah .
Right , they have a fairly steady readership .
Right .
Well , this newspaper is said to have various kinds of topics appropriate to all ages .
Uh-huh , uh-huh .
Well , so , now we need to seriously consider its authenticity or accuracy .
Is the news carried by it credible or not ?
How much is its accuracy , I think , is still quite hard to determine at this time , indeed ,
Uh-huh .
because I will mainly speak from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> perspectives .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mirror</ENAMEX> got hold of the news , it called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">10 Downing Street</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the first night</ENAMEX> , saying that it had such information .
Uh-huh , uh-huh .
Well , it meant to find out whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">10 Downing Street</ENAMEX> had anything to say , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Downing Street</ENAMEX> said it had no comments .
Uh-huh .
However , when the news was released , it set off such a mighty uproar .
Uh-huh .
This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> point .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> point is to look at the reaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station is now asking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> to do is to either confirm the news as true or to deny it .
Uh-huh , uh-huh .
However , right now , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> has neither said it is true nor said it is not .
That is the situation .
It did not confirm anything .
However , there is still <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> detail .
When we introduced the context information , we also mentioned the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> staff members involved in the leakage of the information .
These <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> staff members , also considered <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> government employees , have already been under interrogation .
Well , since they are under interrogation , it means they may have indeed divulged the secret .
Could this be used to determine that there was indeed such an incident ?
There was such an incident , um , uh-huh .
I think there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> questions involved in this matter .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> is whether there is any secret being divulged , and the other is whether the news that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> wanted to bomb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station is true .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
I think these are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> different questions .
Uh-huh .
Regarding the leakage of the secret , it seems that the possibility here , ah , is really big .
What secret exactly was divulged ?
Um .
Because according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> , um , government , um , its <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Official Secrets Act Section 5</ENAMEX> , that is to say , it is illegal for newspapers or media to publicize indiscreetly government information obtained through unauthorized channels .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
So , well , these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> people have already been suspected of violating this section , and that is why they have been sued .
Right .
Well , of course it is still in a preliminary stage right now , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> a hearing lasting only <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</ENAMEX> was held .
Uh-huh .
But , both of these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> people denied they were guilty .
Uh-huh .
So , now it will still have to go through a quite lengthy judicial procedure .
Eh , in other words , although they were interrogated , whether the secret leaked was something like our topic <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , that is , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said he wanted to bomb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station , whether the secret divulged was this record , these are still <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> different things .
However , it should be closely related to this because this is about the so - called memo .
Uh-huh .
It should be closely related .
Yeah .
Uh-huh .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 16 of last year</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> was visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , they had some exchange between them .
That was how this memo came into being .
It was about <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> pages long .
Right .
Uh-huh .
Well , in this memo , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> seemed to imply that he probably wanted to bomb this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
At that time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> tried his best to persuade him not to do it .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , but the very authenticity of the incident , I think , still needs to be determined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> government or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> government .
They need to come out for making clarification and judgment .
Yeah .
Well , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> , we know , ah , you worked as a reporter in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> and were very familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
So how do you look at this incident ?
Do you think it is real or not ?
Um .
I think it is possible that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> wanted to bomb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
Uh-huh .
That 's because all the things reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station since its establishment in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> were those the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> did not want viewers in the world to look at , especially with respect to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Afghan war</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Iraq war</ENAMEX> .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
What they reported was entirely incompatible with the so - called freedom of the press advocated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> .
Uh-huh .
For instance , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> attacked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station several times .
It happened once that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , er , together with that Defense Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> , they put pressure , put pressure on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Qatari</ENAMEX> government , saying you should not broadcast these news items that were harmful to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , later , under such circumstances , eh , the director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station was replaced once .
Uh-huh .
Under his pressure .
Uh-huh .
But , the leader of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jazeera</ENAMEX> , ah , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> replied that we advocate the same freedom of the press as the freedom of the press in your country and that our government has no right to interfere with what is being reported by a private TV station .
That is to say , eh , according to your judgment , this incident was possible because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> has long considered it a thorn in its flesh .
Right .
So , to say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> government or the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> president had such an idea , you think many people may easily believe it .
Yeah .
There is such possibility .
Right , yes .
All right , regarding whether this incident was real or not , according to you <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> , eh , there is indeed a lot of information .
There are no waves without wind .
Yeah .
Right , there are no waves without wind .
So , this incident probably does have some basis .
Some basis .
Well , let 's now focus on this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
As a matter of fact , when we watch TV , we can see many news services , ah , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> , often replaying footage by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station logo is on , people should be quite familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
The station logo , right .
Yeah .
But how did this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station rise to fame competing with so many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> media outlets in news coverage ?
Let 's learn about this through another background video clip .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station , established in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1996</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> , is an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic - language</ENAMEX> news TV station broadcasting global news and reports nonstop around the clock .
Its staff all comes from various <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> countries , and its viewership has reached <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 million</ENAMEX> .
Prior to its establishment , there has been no <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic - language</ENAMEX> TV station broadcasting news nonstop around the clock in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> world .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 2001</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">9 / 11</ENAMEX> attacks broke out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 7</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> launched military strikes on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> .
As a result , another news war erupted in the international media community .
When people all over the world expected to watch the live broadcast of the war by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> , they could only see a few blurry images on TV .
Meanwhile , however , the little known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station based in the small <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Gulf</ENAMEX> country of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> suddenly emerged to broadcast the progress of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Afghan war</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic language</ENAMEX> and mobilized its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</ENAMEX> reporting stations all over the world to conduct an around - the - clock follow up coverage .
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> regime announced that reporters from all countries were banned from entering the territory of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station was the only one that could enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> - controlled area .
Taking such an advantage , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station started to establish its unique leading position in covering <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Afghan war</ENAMEX> with its frequent live broadcast of missile attacks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghan</ENAMEX> capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kabul</ENAMEX> .
During the war , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station continued to broadcast exclusive news and images under its logo and sell them to competitors at the high price of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">20,000 US dollars</ENAMEX> per minute .
While the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> military searched everywhere for information on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bin Laden</ENAMEX> in vain , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station frequently aired the footage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bin Laden</ENAMEX> making a speech .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> , we know that you happened to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station was just established in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> .
Right .
In addition , you were said to have attended the inaugural broadcast ceremony .
What did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station look like when it just started broadcasting ?
What kind of news broadcast style was featured at that time ?
Er , they held an inaugural broadcast ceremony at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of November 1996</ENAMEX> at that time .
We reporters in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> were also invited to attend this inaugural broadcast ceremony .
Uh-huh .
There were n't many people at the time .
Uh-huh .
But at the time of its establishment , this , er , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station already had a very good foundation in terms of reporters .
Uh-huh .
Why ?
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> , um , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Arabic Language TV Station</ENAMEX> was shut down due to funding problems .
Uh-huh .
So , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station seized this opportunity to get hold of this , this entire group of people by hiring them , er , as their reporters , editors , or anchors at high salaries .
Uh-huh .
So , they had a relatively good team of reporters .
Uh-huh .
Well , this way , later it <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">followed</ENAMEX> that , er , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">er</ENAMEX> , three - Chinese - character , three , er , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> - character principle of news reporting called , er , independence , neutrality , ah , neutrality , balance , and freedom .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
So , what it reported was in a completely different style from that of some other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> TV stations .
Right .
In this respect , that is , let me add <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> point , that is , this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station , ah , its style is very much characterized by direct borrowing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> , for instance , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> mainstream media outlets .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Right .
Uh-huh .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> , and the other is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> .
Yeah .
Well , I think that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> , in particular , has quite a big influence on it .
Just now Mr. Wu mentioned , that is to say , many of its reporters directly came from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> channel at that time .
Uh-huh .
That was jointly run by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> .
So it had a very good foundation .
In addition , that is , actually , this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station has a quite unique structure .
That 's because the emir of this country is called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamad</ENAMEX> .
He studied in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and therefore had quite a good knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> TV station .
He also quite admired it .
So , in this way , it has borrowed some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> style .
For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> is a very old TV group established in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</ENAMEX> .
Uh-huh .
Though it is funded by the government with many of its properties owned by the government , it still follows the guideline of editorial independence .
Uh-huh .
For instance , the top decision - making body of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> is called the board of directors which are composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve</ENAMEX> members directly appointed by the Queen .
Uh-huh .
So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station has also adopted this structure .
It has a top <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> - member board of directors .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
However , even if its property , ah , and funds can come from the government , it still relatively has its editorial independence .
Eh , but in essence , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> , is it really a private TV station or a government - run TV station ?
Er , they themselves claim that it is a private TV station , but in reality it could not have been established without a large amount of financial support given by the government .
That 's because it , eh , has an extremely small number of ads during its around the clock broadcast , ah , TV broadcast .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , in addition , it has such a large team , especially with high , high salaries , er , wages , and reporters based abroad , so many reporters abroad .
If the government had not supported such expenditures , eh , it would be impossible for a private TV station to survive .
According to your knowledge , how much is its yearly expenditure ?
It was said that the yearly expenditures seem to be about <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">7 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> .
About <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">7 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> , that is equivalent to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 50 billion RMB</ENAMEX> .
We should say this is a very huge financial expenditure .
Uh-huh .
Extremely large .
Yeah .
Therefore , some people call it gaining voice but losing money because it has relatively small revenues due to few ads .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
But it has a tremendous influence .
Right .
So , it appears that it is still not bad in gaining voice as it does achieve some effect .
Yeah .
Ha .
Well , speaking of its influence , we have also noticed that er , during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Afghan war</ENAMEX> , er , because it has the exclusive interview right to enter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> to conduct independent and exclusive interviews , we could say this is one of its advantages .
Uh-huh .
It also presented an opportunity to it as well .
Well , to the development of a TV station , both opportunity and real strength are actually very important .
Well , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station has been able to develop into its current status , what do you think has it relied upon so that its competitiveness and influential power can surpass , even surpassed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Iraq war</ENAMEX> ?
The greatest feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station is that it is a small station that competes with large ones and has become well - known through wars .
That is , the reason why it can establish itself is that it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> relied on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Afghan war</ENAMEX> , and then <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Iraq war</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the 9 / 11</ENAMEX> .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
So , it made full use of these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> opportunities .
In addition , as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Iraq war</ENAMEX> occurred right in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> country , everyone is very much concerned with what is going on in the war .
So , this provides it with a large viewership , making it instantly famous .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Besides , it has a lot of resources , including its exclusive coverage right in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> as you mentioned just now .
Uh-huh , uh-huh .
In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station is actually quite unique in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> region .
For instance , a very tough conflict in this region is the conflict between <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , in general , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> will not invite the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> leader to make a speech on their TV .
However , for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station , it could invite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> prime minister at that time , to deliver a speech at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
This was unprecedented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> world .
Right .
Uh-huh .
Well , this also gave it a very unique perspective .
Uh-huh .
So , the reason why it is successful , to put it simply , I think , is that it mainly relies on its own very professional news team .
It has a very talented team , eh .
Yeah .
In addition , it also looks at major events as they happen from the unique perspective of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> region or <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> world .
Uh-huh .
I think that favorable opportunities and geographical conditions also helped because people involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Afghan war</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> were mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> .
Uh-huh .
They were from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> countries .
They spoke <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">the Arabic language</ENAMEX> .
Well , that was the opportunity .
In particular , it was the same with the Iraq , <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Iraq war</ENAMEX> , which took place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
In the Iraq , <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Iraq war</ENAMEX> , as far as I know , among foreign media teams dispatched to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> for coverage , I should say , the one from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station was the most powerful .
Uh-huh .
It had <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> reporting stations at that time , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> group in the south in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Basra</ENAMEX> , well , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> group in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> , and still another group in the north in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mosul</ENAMEX> .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
So it was basically covering the Iraq , um , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> war from all perspectives .
So , it surely surpassed some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> media in covering <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Iraq war</ENAMEX> in certain areas .
Uh-huh .
We could say it owed its success to good opportunities , which it seized ;
Yes .
favorable geographical conditions ; that is to say , it happens to be located geographically in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> world ;
Yeah .
and also harmonious human conditions ; that is to say , it has its own very rounded and talented team .
Er , that is why it is highly influential and competitive .
However , as it is becoming more and more influential and competitive , it has also become a thorn in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> side .
Well , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> we should say we have just given an introduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
Well , next let 's learn about more .
What conflicts are there between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> ?
Why has it become a thorn in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> side ?
Since it gained instant fame during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Afghan war</ENAMEX> , the style of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station in pursuit of the freedom of the press and independence has gradually won widespread international attention .
However , at the same time , the conflict between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> has been increasing .
According to reports , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> repeatedly expressed their strong displeasure with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Qatari</ENAMEX> leaders , demanding its government to restrain it more firmly .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> government thinks that radicals , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="5">anti-American</ENAMEX> and religious commentators have become frequent guests at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
In particular , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bin Laden</ENAMEX> has chosen it as his exclusive information release agency , endowing it with a unique advantage .
All these made the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> hate and fear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station at the same time .
Officials of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration called it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama</ENAMEX> 's TV station on different occasions because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bin Laden 's</ENAMEX> full name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama bin Laden</ENAMEX> .
During <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Iraq war</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station not only broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> 's impassioned pre-war speeches and the image of coalition troops marching toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , but also broadcast the bloody bodies of civilians next to bombed cars .
The video camera scanned over the corpses of coalition troops killed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> military , and over that little tearful boy with bandages around his head , crying .
If you see the war on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> TV as an electronic game and grand display of smoke and fire , then from the footage by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station , you see the war only as hell .
Do you still remember , ah , during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Afghan war</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Iraq war</ENAMEX> , we could often see on screen the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera</ENAMEX> footage such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bin Laden</ENAMEX> and some other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Qaeda</ENAMEX> leaders giving speeches .
Ah , moreover , the footage that many other TV stations were using also basically came from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
Therefore , at that time <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> thought , said that since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station broadcast these activities of terrorists , it must be colluding with terrorists .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
So , it was always thought that there seemed to be some subtle relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Qaeda</ENAMEX> .
Taciturn agreement .
Taciturn agreement .
Yeah .
Taciturn agreement .
Right , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> , how do you look at this issue ?
This may have something to do with the good opportunities and favorable geographical conditions mentioned earlier .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Since , er , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> people were all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> , they tried by various means to gain the information so as to expand their own influence .
This has been the consistent practice of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera</ENAMEX> station .
Uh-huh .
Well , the same goes with <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Iraq war</ENAMEX> .
They , eh , also speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> , right ?
Another <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabic</ENAMEX> nationality .
Uh-huh .
What they reported , eh , was very much welcomed and favored by %pw <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> viewers .
Uh-huh .
That 's because what they have reported can not be found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> media reports .
That 's why their fame grows .
That is to say , it indeed inspires a kind of patriotic or nationalistic sentiments among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> countries .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
I think this , this , this point is %pw very important .
In other words , it also benefits from the hard work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
That is , it is from the perspective of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> that it looks at the war or also looks at major events .
So , when it makes a report , its perspective , analysis , and its possible outcome or some process of its analysis are different from those of reports by the Western mainstream media such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> .
Well , it is exactly because of this , even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station may not be necessarily linked with any other organizations , simply because it reports the war using a different voice , it has become the target of attacks by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> .
Right .
Well , regarding this incident , what kind of reaction did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station have ?
We do n't have much information right now .
But when our correspondents went to have an interview at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> office <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , they asked their office administrator named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ezzat</ENAMEX> , ah , the question why the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> threatened to bomb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station ?
He is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> expert and speaks excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> .
Let 's hear what he said .
I think the reason , er , is -- In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> region , in particular , currently , many , some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> officials , for instance , many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> officials , they admitted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> policies on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> region , eh , region have many mistakes .
Er , this point must be acknowledged .
However , up till now , er , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration , it has not constant number , er , er , understood or realized -- they did not want to assume responsibility for what they have done there .
So , it wanted to blame its mistakes in this region on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</ENAMEX> , it is because many -- some things are in conflict with its interests .
However , when I report , I do n't report for the sake of making somebody happy or not making somebody unhappy .
This is not my principle , nor is my job .
Some of the footage we broadcast did not conform to its interests .
So it started to put this restrictive measure in retaliation .
So , the issue is not that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station is making <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="5">anti-American</ENAMEX> reports .
In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> government is carrying out some measures and work against these people in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> region and against the world peace .
As you know , we were , eh , reporting the war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fallujah</ENAMEX> .
Our reporter also , eh , almost had an accident there as several shots were purposely , er , fired at him .
Then , in the end , er , Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> also directly blamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
Er , who and who , er , most of what the reporter said , er , was groundless .
In the end , later , did we say anything later ?
We stopped talking .
We then showed viewers facts and let the images speak by themselves .
We did not do anything at that time .
Our reporters were forced not to make any commentaries or any reports .
We simply showed people the footage about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fallujah</ENAMEX> .
Well , the facts may not conform to the interests of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> .
Uh-huh , uh-huh .
In fact he mentioned a very important point of view here .
Ah ,
Uh-huh .
That is to say , this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station , due to its unique perspective , is different from what is expected of it .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station , there is one , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> famous saying , that is , if the whole world listens to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> , or the whole world watches <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> , then whom does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> watch or listen to ?
That is also an issue of the right of speech .
Well , in fact , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> has long been suppressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station .
For instance , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station 's office in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> was bombed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</ENAMEX> .
Yeah .
Uh-huh .
Well , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station 's office in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> was also bombed .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 8</ENAMEX> , its reporting station in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> was bombed , and one reporter was killed .
Yeah .
Right .
In addition , currently one of its reporters is still detained by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Guantanamo</ENAMEX> military base .
Right .
Eh , it was said that a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sudanese</ENAMEX> correspondent from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station , er , was arrested in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and has been detained ever since at this , er , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> military base at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Guantanamo</ENAMEX> .
Right .
Yeah .
We could say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> has been suppressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station for quite a long time .
Yeah .
Well , through what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ezzat</ENAMEX> said himself , he also thought he was innocent .
Uh-huh .
He basically also blamed it on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> .
Well , will <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station really sue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> ?
Will <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> have any occasion or opportunity to have this matter clarified ?
Would you please analyze how this incident will develop next .
I think that right now it is most likely -- because right now , it has actually entered into a certain judicial procedure in some sense .
Uh-huh .
That is to say , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> judicial authority has already brought charges against these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> officials , er , suspected of disclosing secret documents .
Uh-huh .
Well , now we have seen that the director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station has also flown to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> to demand an explanation from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> .
Uh-huh .
To bring up a lawsuit .
Right ?
That is , I think that right now it is more likely to stay for a while as a topic of public commentaries .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
It will stay as a topic of public commentaries , because this involves -- if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> indeed had such a plan , then its so - called %pw , the freedom of speech it advocates will be again greatly discounted .
Uh-huh .
We know that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> , they made a lot of efforts in controlling the right of speech in the international mainstream media .
This reminds me of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 1999</ENAMEX> .
During <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Kosovo war</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> blew up the radio station of Milosevic , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> .
Uh-huh .
It indeed blew up this radio station of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> .
Right .
Then , later , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Westerners</ENAMEX> themselves , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , admitted that the reason why it won <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Kosovo war</ENAMEX> was to a large extent that they won the other party in public opinion .
Uh-huh .
It seems that this incident will again lead to a public opinion war .
Uh-huh .
After this incident was exposed , ah , al - Jazeera TV station , TV station issued a statement <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
The main idea of the statement was , eh , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera TV</ENAMEX> station has always followed the principle of impartiality , neutrality , and balance in news coverage .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
For that purpose , it is now seriously investigating the news about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> plan to bomb the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Jazeera</ENAMEX> headquarters in reported by the US newspaper , ah , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> newspaper , and it hopes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> government can explain this .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Right , it seems that this incident , as it develops , will have a lot of things worthy of our attention .
However , as we are running out of time <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , let 's end our discussion here .
Thank you <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> very much for participating in our program .
Thanks !
Uh-huh .
All right , dear viewers , that 's all for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Focus Today</ENAMEX> .
Thank you for watching .
Good-bye .
