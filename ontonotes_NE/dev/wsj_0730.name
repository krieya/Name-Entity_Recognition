<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> Thefts Make Travel Agents Jittery
BEING A TRAVEL agent used to be pretty glamorous .
Now it 's getting downright dangerous .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 25</ENAMEX> agencies have been robbed , compared with only a handful <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">all last year</ENAMEX> , according to police and travel - agency groups .
Most of the cases have been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> agent was stabbed and another was shot and killed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> police say the thieves seem to be part of a crime network that knows how to convert blank tickets into real ones .
Already , the stolen tickets have been used for flights all over the world .
So far , the thieves have stolen <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,632</ENAMEX> blank tickets , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Airline Reporting Corp.</ENAMEX> , a ticket processing center .
Police say the robberies are usually pulled off by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to five</ENAMEX> men , who walk into the agencies near closing or <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">lunch time</ENAMEX> , when few employees are there .
`` They looked like ordinary vacationers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willy LLerena</ENAMEX> , owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Travel Air Service</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte Bello</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , describing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> men who entered his agency <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last June</ENAMEX> .
But then , he says , they put <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> loaded pistols to his temple and demanded he open the safe .
When he initially refused , he says , they stabbed him in the back and made off with $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,000</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</ENAMEX> blank tickets .
`` They said they wanted to show me how serious they were , '' he says .
As word of the crime spree has spread , many agents have started changing their open - door policies .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">El Monte Travel Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Monte</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , customers now can get in only through a buzzer and lock system .
`` It 's hard to deal with clients this way in a service business , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph `` Bud '' Conner</ENAMEX> , owner of the agency , which was robbed of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</ENAMEX> blank tickets and $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">850</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> .
`` But we 're just too nervous . ''
The robberies also have set off a controversy involving the airlines .
Agents say airlines , which track ticket numbers of all stolen tickets , should be doing more to catch the thieves by confiscating the tickets when they 're used .
`` They have the most sophisticated computers in the world , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LLerena</ENAMEX> .
`` They ought to be able to do this . ''
But airlines say it would be too expensive and cause too many delays if they started using computerized scanners to check tickets at the gate .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Texans</ENAMEX> Get Reasonable Car Rental Insurance
CONSUMER advocates have long claimed that car rental companies charge too much for car rental insurance .
Now , a new law in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> seems to be providing the proof .
The law -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> of its kind -- requires car rental companies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> to charge only `` reasonable '' rates for collision - damage waiver insurance .
Specifically , the law says the rates must closely reflect what the company 's actual expenses have been to replace damaged cars .
Before the law went into effect <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> , car rental companies were charging <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 12</ENAMEX> a day for the waiver in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> .
Now , they 're charging <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little $ 3</ENAMEX> a day .
`` If they 're telling the truth now , then they 've been charging <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">300 %</ENAMEX> more than what is reasonable , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Gardner</ENAMEX> , an assistant state attorney general in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> .
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hertz Corp.</ENAMEX> acknowledges , `` The waiver is n't a source of protection for consumers , but a source of revenue . ''
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hertz</ENAMEX> points out that at least it 's now charging <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 3.95</ENAMEX> a day in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> , while some competitors are charging $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.99</ENAMEX> .
The state attorney general 's office is investigating rental car agencies charging noticeably higher prices .
Flight Attendants Lag Before Jets Even Land
IF YOUR FLIGHT attendant seems a little weary , it may be because he or she has been working <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">20 straight hours</ENAMEX> .
A recent study for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> found that major airlines sometimes make flight attendants work <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">16 hours</ENAMEX> or more straight -- despite union contracts at some airlines limiting duty time to <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">14 hours</ENAMEX> .
Some flight attendants on charter planes are putting in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">20 - hour</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">work days</ENAMEX> , the study found .
This happens because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FAA</ENAMEX> does n't have any rules on duty time for flight attendants ; by contrast , it strictly restricts duty time for pilots and air traffic controllers , usually to a maximum of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10 consecutive hours</ENAMEX> .
`` As far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FAA</ENAMEX> is concerned , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Finucane</ENAMEX> , air safety director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Association of Flight Attendants</ENAMEX> , `` flight attendants can work an unlimited number of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</ENAMEX> . ''
Experts say <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">such long hours</ENAMEX> for attendants pose a safety risk .
For instance , tired flight attendants might not react quickly enough during an emergency evacuation .
`` At the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">their day</ENAMEX> , they are zombies , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Galipault</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Aviation Safety Institute</ENAMEX> , a public - interest group in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Worthington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> .
`` They have to work <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">such long hours</ENAMEX> and then we expect them to be heroes if there 's an evacuation . ''
In response to the study , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FAA</ENAMEX> says it is considering changing its policy -- or lack of it -- on flight attendants .
The agency may not have much choice : A congressional bill has been introduced that would force the agency to limit flight attendant duty time to <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">14 hours</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> flights and <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">16 hours</ENAMEX> on international trips .
Odds and Ends
GOLF HAS BECOME the latest diversion for travelers stuck at some airports .
Simulated golf games , in which players hit golf balls into nets , have been installed at airports in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> ... .
The average cost for breakfast at a `` decent '' hotel restaurant in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> is $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">17.12</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Corporate Travel</ENAMEX> magazine .
The cheapest , among <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> cities surveyed , was $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.11</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> .
