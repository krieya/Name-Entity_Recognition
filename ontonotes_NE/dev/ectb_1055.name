<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's Fitness Market
Gets Pumped Up
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Lin</ENAMEX> / photos by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh Chi - kuang</ENAMEX> / tr. by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Newell</ENAMEX> -RRB-
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tai - wan</ENAMEX> has been swept by a fitness fad .
Clubs offering workout facilities have sprung up incredibly quickly , so that now , counting both established firms and newcomers , there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 700</ENAMEX> separate locations !
In the midst of an economic downturn , the fitness business is remarkably robust .
It is especially noteworthy that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this new century</ENAMEX> large foreign health clubs have set their sights on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> market , hanging out their well - known shingles in a battle for market share with local firms .
This struggle has brought the fitness market to a fever pitch , and also is sparking new and diversified ideas about health in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
" A health club is a playground for adults , that 's what it is ! " says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> , a florist .
This health club in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> 's fashionable eastern district , with its stylish lighting and blasting music , is more like a discotheque .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> has just completed his step aerobics class .
As he catches his breath , he says that he never much liked exercise , but that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the half year</ENAMEX> since joining the club his life has been dramatically transformed .
Not only is his body slimmed down , but he looks and feels much more energetic .
Recreational fitness
" At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> I came just to get in shape .
I signed up with a group of friends who talked me into it .
But it 's fantastic here .
Every time I enter the club and hear that pounding music , I get a rush .
And with so many different and fun aerobics classes , exercise is n't hard labor anymore , " he says .
And thanks to joining the club , the naturally shy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> has made a lot of new friends .
In another club which offers a swimming pool and " spa " services -LRB- like mineral baths or massage -RRB- , a group of middle - aged ladies who work out in the afternoons sit by the side of the pool enthusiastically talking about the best way to reduce fat around the waistline .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang</ENAMEX> declares : " Coming to the health club together is now the most frequent way we neighbors socialize .
Plus by keeping slim you are less likely to get diseases connected to obesity , and you can look younger to boot ! "
Within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last year</ENAMEX> , gleaming new health centers have set up shop in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Tong Lin Department Store</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Eastern District</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NOVA</ENAMEX> shopping center near the train station , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Spring Galaxy</ENAMEX> theater complex in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hsimenting</ENAMEX> .
In order to keep up with the competition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Far Eastern</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sincere</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Asiaworld</ENAMEX> department stores will also go into business with health centers <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
And that 's just in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , numerous gyms , billing themselves as " recreation clubs , " have opened in the cities of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taichung</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tainan</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kaohsiung</ENAMEX> .
A national movement
Seeking to find market niches , various clubs are targeting specific market segments .
Some are for women only .
Others , like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">California Fitness Centers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gold 's Gym</ENAMEX> , set up in commercial districts , aiming for office workers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Alexander</ENAMEX> , an island - wide chain , is family - friendly , open to all ages .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Agora Garden</ENAMEX> , which commands steep prices , combines fitness with business conferencing functions .
The variety is bewildering and the numbers - now <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 700</ENAMEX> locations around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> - are astonishing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rex</ENAMEX> , an overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> , who began his career as a trainer at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">California Fitness Centers</ENAMEX> , took notice of this wave beginning to build <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</ENAMEX> , and returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> to devote himself to the local market .
Analyzing the current direction , he says that global trends and the explosion in media have brought <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> ideas of beauty to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , and the ideal of the " firm and healthy " physique is driving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> consumers into the gym .
" People in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> are beginning to accept that a beautiful body requires effort , and you are n't going to get a sculpted physique with vibrating massage chairs , beauty parlors , or weight - loss pills , " he says .
But people in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> have never had the idea , now common in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> , that physical fitness should be part of the routine of life .
A sculpted body alone is unlikely to be enough to get people motivated to work out -LRB- otherwise you would n't see people spending so much money at beauty parlors for a quick fix -RRB- .
This is why multi-functional health centers - offering health , a good body , fun , and socializing - are driving the market , so that working out has become a fashionable leisure - time activity , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> , never known for their love of athletics , are heading in droves to have fun at the gym .
Local vs. foreign
In general , you could divide the main orientations of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> gyms into two basic types : local and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> .
Large health centers which are backed by local investors and managed by local people focus on combining the long - held beliefs that fall under the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> idea of " health cultivation . "
These types of gyms incorporate spa , beauty , aromatherapy , and recreational functions under one roof .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang Ya - chun</ENAMEX> , chairwoman of the largest local chain , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Alexander Health Clubs</ENAMEX> , which has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> locations island - wide , says that the habit of working out must be cultivated over the long term .
Many people join with a sudden burst of interest , but drop out halfway .
In order to keep business going , and keep people coming habitually over the long term , it is necessary that health centers appeal to customers with " freebies " - meaning gain with no pain .
" If health centers can offer not only working out but also recreational functions , then members will keep coming back , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang</ENAMEX> .
" Modern urban life is stressful and fast - paced , and sometimes a member may be more in need of the relaxation provided by a sauna or aroma - therapy .
Then next time they 'll come back for a workout . "
A mix of freebies and challenges is better at keeping consumers ' motivation high .
While they share the ambition of attracting more people to their ranks , foreign chains nonetheless take a different approach .
Right now the most noteworthy foreign group in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">California Fitness Centers</ENAMEX> , which now has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> gigantic branches .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> regional CEO <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Levine</ENAMEX> says that he does not agree with offering spa and aromatherapy facilities in a gym , because these encourage " laziness . "
But it can not be denied that working out is a relatively new concept in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> .
Hence , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's approach is to make exercise " recreational " and " fashionable . "
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX> explains : " We have deliberately put more lighting and decor into our <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> locations , and placed them in the busiest shopping districts , in hopes that working out will become fashionable , and going to the gym will be like going to a good pub .
We want it to be more cool , more exciting , and more fun than a traditional gym , and for members to come to the center with the same attitude they take shopping for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chanel</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prada</ENAMEX> . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX> says that working out is already part of life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West</ENAMEX> , so people do n't go to the gym to socialize .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asians</ENAMEX> prefer group activities , and as a result <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">California</ENAMEX> is putting more emphasis on aerobics classes , with classes every hour all day , so that members can join in any time .
Each center also has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</ENAMEX> of trainers who provide free advice or paid workout supervision .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> meets <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX>
No matter what tack operators may take to attract consumers , large health centers provide mainly the same services .
Besides traditional equipment for weightlifting and cardio - pulmonary exercises , most have made aerobics the centerpiece in the new fitness fad .
There are all kinds , such as martial arts aerobics , step aerobics , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Latin</ENAMEX> aerobics , and weight - enhanced aerobics .
As their names suggest , these classes modify traditional aerobic dance by adding martial arts moves , step platforms , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Latin</ENAMEX> rhythms , dumbbells , and other props , thereby placing the focus of the workout on different muscle groups .
In addition , aerobics centers commonly provide classes in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> health techniques like yoga , tai - chi , and qigong .
" Yoga and tai - chi have not been added just for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Levine</ENAMEX> .
In fact , the trend in fitness is toward a more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Oriental</ENAMEX> approach , such as the inclusion of martial arts or " power yoga " into aerobics .
There is little tradition of athletics in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , and it is too early to talk about any uniquely local forms that can be incorporated into <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> workouts .
But it is interesting to observe how differences in definitions of beauty have affected exercise preferences .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rex</ENAMEX> , with his many years of training experience , finds it especially notable that " women in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> do n't really go for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> female approach of developing muscular bodies .
They prefer lithe bodies , and as a result they are much more into aerobics than weight training .
Most guys in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , focus on the upper body , and are looking for form , rather than aiming to be hugely muscular . "
Healthy consumption ?
You might think that local health centers , with more attention to relaxation and " health cultivation , " would attract a higher age bracket , while foreign centers , with the accent on fashion and novelty , would draw the younger crowd .
But these lines do not necessarily define how consumers choose .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng Chia - cheng</ENAMEX> , who has just finished his military service and is preparing for the bar exam , says that his main consideration in choosing a center was location and convenience .
He does n't like the crowded feeling of the shopping district .
" When you work out , the atmosphere should be calm , so that you can use different equipment when you need to and your concentration is n't broken by disturbances . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liang Yung - hwa</ENAMEX> , manager of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yungho</ENAMEX> branch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eslite</ENAMEX> bookstore , who has been working out for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> now , says that the new clubs spend too much money on lighting and on equipment that people who are really serious about working out never use , so the membership fees are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three to four</ENAMEX> times those of the older gyms .
He declares : " The lives of city people are incredibly busy , and it 's already a luxury to have <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</ENAMEX> a day to work out , so there is n't much time to waste on stuff that is purely for recreation .
But if you consider that it costs <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 20,000</ENAMEX> in annual fees , plus the initial membership price of another <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 10 - 20,000</ENAMEX> - altogether about a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">month</ENAMEX> 's salary for an office worker - most of that money is wasted . "
With consumers like him , who do n't throw their money around , despite the proliferation of new health centers , traditional gyms have not been badly affected .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Ting - yin</ENAMEX> , the proprietor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Taipei Gym</ENAMEX> , which has been going strong for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">16 years</ENAMEX> now , says that the fitness fad is good for all exercise enthusiasts : " <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Ten or so years ago</ENAMEX> people had to scrape together a bunch of odds and ends of free weights , which of course limited how much could be done .
Now there are machines available for training each particular muscle . "
Though , he adds , there is also such a thing as too much equipment of little value .
Fitness or foolhardiness ?
Fitness is a worthwhile investment as well as being a fad .
But blind following of fads can lead to an outcome exactly opposite to the one desired .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung Pei - chen</ENAMEX> , chairwoman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Taiwan Adventist Hospital</ENAMEX> , says that from time to time whole families take up special offers and join together , but , in her opinion , health club facilities -LRB- except for swimming pools -RRB- are not necessarily suitable for all age groups .
" People over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50</ENAMEX> or under <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">16</ENAMEX> can easily hurt themselves lifting heavy weights , so I tell people not to be foolhardy , " she says .
The muscles of older people are less securely attached to their bones , and unless a person has been working out since a young age , sudden intense exercise can lead to a deterioration of cartilage , with more damage than benefit for the body .
As for children , they tend to think of exercise as just a kind of play , with accidents often resulting because of fooling around .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung</ENAMEX> suggests that fitness should begin when young , and those who start very late should stick to swimming , fast walking , and exercise bikes , which are of moderate intensity .
And she adds , " It 's more natural just to exercise when and where you can in daily life - take a walk in the park , climb the stairs . . . . "
Be that as it may , walking in the park is no substitute for a sustained workout program .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Li - hua</ENAMEX> , a sales manager in a high - tech industry who has been working out for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</ENAMEX> , from the earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Clark Hatch Fitness Center</ENAMEX> to the health and beauty center in a hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , says that people who work out for a long time truly love exercise , love themselves , and are seeking a better quality of life .
This is a habit that is well worth investing in , and people should force themselves to go .
" It 's better to invest in training your body than to spend time and money on medical care when you get sick , " she says .
As for the future , health club managers are optimistic about the potential market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Levine</ENAMEX> relates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tong Lin</ENAMEX> branch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">California</ENAMEX> has more members than any of their branches anywhere in the world .
Working out is not like other consumer behavior : The demand for exercise among modern people will only increase , not decline .
It seems that at least as far as the operators are concerned , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> health clubs are certainly working out .

Everyone can appreciate a good physique , and the desire to have one is a major motivating factor for people to work out .

There are great differences among clubs in terms of facilities and prices .
You 'd better shop around .
