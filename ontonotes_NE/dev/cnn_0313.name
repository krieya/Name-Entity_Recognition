<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tariq Aziz 's</ENAMEX> son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ziad</ENAMEX> looks worried .
He 's willing to talk with us , but not be interviewed , as he explains how his father negotiated his surrender .
He says his father 's night - time handover was dignified , that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> forces offered medical support for his father 's heart condition , that has caused <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> heart attacks recently .
They do n't know when to expect him back , and have been told he faces lots of questions .
Outside , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> troops provide occasional protection .
Nearby , a neighbor hopes all will be well .
Another neighbor comes to our car to give his opinion .
He was a normal person , he says , a good neighbor , but a bad politician .
At their nearby store , they prepare to open for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">their first day</ENAMEX> of business since the war .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aziz</ENAMEX> was a politician he said .
It 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> and the others <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> have problems with .
Maybe he gives us information about the missing people , and perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> .
Further down the road , these men wait for a ride .
Neither have anything bad to say about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aziz</ENAMEX> .
We call him Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aziz</ENAMEX> , and I 'm proud of him , says this former traffic cop .
He was cultured , and I wish someone like him rules us .
His friend adds , if all the leaders stayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> , then the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> will catch them .
Across town in a less affluent neighborhood , reactions to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aziz</ENAMEX> 's arrest are profoundly different .
I did n't hear about it , explains this man , because we did n't have electricity .
When we explained the news to the crowd , a bystander steps forward .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is playing a trick on us he says .
Where is our government and our security ?
At the pickle store , passions are enflamed by the lack of services .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aziz</ENAMEX> is a war criminal says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed</ENAMEX> .
He should get the death penalty , just like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</ENAMEX> times over .
We give Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</ENAMEX> to get things right he says , going on to explain , if not , we will fight the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> .
The biggest problem <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tariq Aziz '</ENAMEX> family says they now face is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aziz</ENAMEX> is now safely in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> custody , they do n't know how safe they are out on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> 's streets .
