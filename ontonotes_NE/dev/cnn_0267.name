Bombardment of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> continues tonight and over <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the past 20 minutes</ENAMEX> , explosions rocking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> , central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> , the outskirts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> , and importantly , as the coalition forces , principally <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Army</ENAMEX> forces , move against <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saddam Hussein International Airport</ENAMEX> -- which is <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about ten miles</ENAMEX> outside the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> -- those explosions are intensified .
If we may again go to the wide screen of what appears to me to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Abu Dhabi</ENAMEX> television that is providing this picture , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">3:20 a.m.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> , live pictures again .
That it is very difficult to discern whether or not that is , in point of fact , the missiles that we have become accustomed to striking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> and its environs , or whether it is the large <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,000 pound</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JDAM</ENAMEX> bombs that have been striking targets selected by the coalition in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> , or whether these flashes now represent artillery barrages as fighting continues to take control of the -- to take control of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saddam International Airport</ENAMEX> .
Again , correspondents , our correspondents with the -- embedded with these forces , with them in the field , saying in some cases they can see the lights of the skyline of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> .
Over the course of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two weeks</ENAMEX> , since this war began , something like <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23,000</ENAMEX> coalition sorties have been flown , and over the course of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the past 24 hours</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,900</ENAMEX> sorties flown , and we are told that , of those , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">850</ENAMEX> were strike sorties , motor vehicle most of those directed against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republican Guard</ENAMEX> .
As you know , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republican Guard</ENAMEX> just outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> to defend the city and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein 's</ENAMEX> regime , in principal .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> of those divisions absolutely devastated , destroyed , the so - called <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Medina</ENAMEX> division , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> division .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> division , of course , getting its name from the fact that it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Republican Guard</ENAMEX> division designated to defend principally <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</ENAMEX> other divisions we are told have also been hit very , very very hard and are principally trying to reinforce units .
VA also been hit very hard .
So we are seeing a lot of what some of the military officials are calling a method that does not seem to be directed by one person from the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> , and that raises questions , questions that have been in front of us since that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> strike on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March 19th</ENAMEX> against the location that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> military intelligence thought was a place where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> , perhaps his sons , were .
That preemptive strike they put , I think somewhat elegantly , trying to strike at the head of the snake .
New explosions rocking parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> tonight .
We will continue to monitor that .
We , of course , will bring the word to you just as soon as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Army</ENAMEX> and coalition forces do take control of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saddam Hussein International Airport</ENAMEX> , just on the outskirts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> .
In southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> forces also moving closer to the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> largest city in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Basra</ENAMEX> .
They captured an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> base in an unused factory in the southern suburbs of that city .
