<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> executives and lawyers provided `` misleading and false '' information to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> in an effort to cover up `` longstanding fraudulent '' billing practices , federal prosecutors alleged in legal briefs .
The government 's startling allegations , filed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only days</ENAMEX> before the scheduled start of a criminal overcharge trial against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> federal district court , challenge the motives and veracity of the nation 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> - largest defense contractor .
In a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> asserted that `` prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses , distorted documents and ignored important facts . ''
The company attacked the government 's allegations as `` reckless and baseless mudslinging , '' and said its management `` promptly and accurately reported '' to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> all relevant information about billing practices .
The case strikes at the corporate image of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> , which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the Strategic Defense Initiative , and could cause a loss of future defense contracts if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justice Department</ENAMEX> officials take a tough stance .
The company has been considered an industry leader in advocating cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices .
But the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> to obscure from federal authorities the extent and details of `` widespread '' fraudulent billing practices .
The problems were uncovered during a series of internal investigations of the company 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Space Systems</ENAMEX> division , which has been the focus of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> separate overcharge prosecutions by the government since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> .
The dispute stems from pretrial maneuvering in the pending court case , in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company memos , reports and documents .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last November</ENAMEX> , a federal grand jury indicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Army</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21 million</ENAMEX> on a logistics computer contract .
The company , for its part , maintains that many of the disputed documents are privileged attorney - client communications that should n't be turned over to prosecutors .
A hearing is scheduled on the issue <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
The government 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">136</ENAMEX> - page filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1985</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> was accused of defrauding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> by illegally claiming cost overruns on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Minuteman</ENAMEX> missile contracts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> pleaded guilty and paid a fine of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 million</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Minuteman</ENAMEX> case , which involved some of the same individuals and operations that are at the center of the dispute in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> court .
In order to show that all of its units had corrected billing problems and therefore should become eligible again for new contracts , prosecutors contend that `` high - level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> executives '' and company lawyers provided `` misleading statements '' to then - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Air Force</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verne Orr</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> officials during a series of meetings in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> .
Overall , the government contends that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> 's disclosure efforts largely were intended to `` curry favor '' with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> officials without detailing the extent of the management lapses and allegedly pervasive billing irregularities uncovered by company investigations .
Prosecutors depict a company that allegedly sat on damaging evidence of overcharges from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> , despite warnings from an internal auditor .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> finally disclosed the problems , prosecutors contend that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orr</ENAMEX> `` was erroneously informed that the -LCB- suspected -RCB- practices had only just been discovered '' by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> management .
In its brief , the government asserted that it needs the internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> documents to rebut anticipated efforts by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> during the trial to demonstrate `` its good corporate character . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> , which was surprised by the last - minute subpoena for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</ENAMEX> boxes and file cabinets of documents , countered that senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> managers did n't find out about questionable billing practices until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> , and that the information was passed on quickly to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orr</ENAMEX> at his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> meeting with company representatives .
Subsequent meetings , initiated after the company and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of its units were briefly suspended from federal contracts , were held to familiarize Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orr</ENAMEX> with the company 's self - policing procedures and to disclose additional information , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> 's filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity .
The company 's conduct `` does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent , ratification or cover - up , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> 's brief asserts .
`` On the contrary , it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orr</ENAMEX> could n't be reached for comment <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
