It looks like an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> tradition is building .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80,000</ENAMEX> people with a shared love of music converge on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> pasture for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</ENAMEX> of good vibes and who knows what else .
It 's called <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Bonnaroo</ENAMEX> .
Check it out .
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Bonnaroo</ENAMEX> is kind of this going example of what the whole jam band community is turned in .
That 's what I really like about the jam community , its acceptance of improvizational music , despite whatever region or genre .
It 's about the freedom of the music and the freedom of expression .
Well , we sold all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80,000</ENAMEX> tickets through our web site .
We sold out in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">16 days</ENAMEX> .
I mean , the amazing thing is , we used no traditional advertising .
We put all these bands together .
It draws a huge audience , so the record companies and the music business has to take all of these forms of music more seriously .
It 's like strength in numbers .
I hope this kind of thing can happen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , instead of it just being these isolated festivals like <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Bonnaroo</ENAMEX> , it really can happen in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> cities every summer , like the festivals do in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> .
My only complaint is the overlapping .
You know , as a music lover that I am , there 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> acts all playing at the same time on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> different stages that I want to see .
It really comes from the actual bands and the fact that there 's this grassroots following that 's been there , you know , for a long time , primarily started by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Grateful Dead</ENAMEX> , at least the future by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Grateful Dead</ENAMEX> .
We will get by we will survive .
We 're carrying on a tradition that started a long time .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> music , improvization is what it 's always been about .
It 's not just clapping and having a good time .
It makes you feel a certain kind of love , and hopefully , that translates in the community .
You go out .
You hug someone .
You do something good .
You make a better world .
For me , that 's music .
We love you .
