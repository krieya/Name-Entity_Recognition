<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">, Shimon Peres ,</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , by persevering in going its own way , and concentrating its efforts on conquering poverty set an example for the people of every country of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> .
This is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX> said in the preface he composed especially for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> edition of his just published new work " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The New Middle East</ENAMEX> . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX> said : " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> are at the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> ends of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> , separated by ' <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten thousand</ENAMEX> crags and torrents . '
Yet the people of our <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries nevertheless are similar to one another .
The great <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> people offered up to the world cultural riches on the spiritual plane and material plane .
If these riches did n't exist , people would not be able to describe the course of history . "
He said in addition : " We who live in western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> are gazing at the east with a look of hope and reverence .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> has already demonstrated to the entire world that the strategy for resolving the question of poverty in society lies in carrying out a plan that has been reasoned out and in concentrating strength towards a task that has a reasonable hope of success . . . . . . .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> still believes in the path that it itself has specified .
In the past it has not yielded to any pressure from outside , and now it still unswervingly defends the right to determine its own future for itself . "
The book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">" The New Middle East "</ENAMEX> originally was published as an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> edition around <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of autumn last year</ENAMEX> .
The author starts the discussion from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September of that year</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's signing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Declaration of Principles of Palestinian Autonomy with the Palestine Liberation Organization</ENAMEX> , and looks back at the complex struggles of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several hundred years</ENAMEX> , especially <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the most recent half century</ENAMEX> .
He expresses his views on building a new <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> in the future .
In the preface to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> edition , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX> says that the leaders of every country must have vision , relinquish old grudges , and create peace in order to deal with " challenges of tomorrow . "
He points out , " At a time when we are on the threshold of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</ENAMEX> , warfare no longer has any use .
The important problems we are up against are how to conquer poverty and scarcity . "
To do this , he emphasized , " We must control the desert that is day - by - day eroding arable land , develop new sources of water , and carry out new engineering projects . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX> pointed out that these goals are not likely to be realized easily .
They require a sensible attitude and a dedicated spirit .
He observed , " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> has already demonstrated that it could conquer poverty and the misery that generations of people have suffered .
We hope that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> becomes a model that the people of all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> countries , including both <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> , can imitate on the road that we walk together heading towards the future .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> edition of the book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">" The New Middle East "</ENAMEX> has already recently been published and distributed through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Xinhua Publishing</ENAMEX> .
