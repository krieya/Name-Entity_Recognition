<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">THREE</ENAMEX> COMPUTERS THAT CHANGED the face of personal computing were launched in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">That year</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Apple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Commodore</ENAMEX> Pet and Tandy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TRS - 80</ENAMEX> came to market .
The computers were crude by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's standards .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Apple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> owners , for example , had to use their television sets as screens and stored data on audiocassettes .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Apple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> was a major advance from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Apple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> , which was built in a garage by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Wozniak</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Jobs</ENAMEX> for hobbyists such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Homebrew Computer Club</ENAMEX> .
In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Apple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">an affordable $ 1,298</ENAMEX> .
Crude as they were , these early PCs triggered explosive product development in desktop models for the home and office .
Big mainframe computers for business had been around for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> .
But the new <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</ENAMEX> PCs -- unlike earlier built - from - kit types such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Altair</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IMSAI</ENAMEX> -- had keyboards and could store about two pages of data in their memories .
Current PCs are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50</ENAMEX> times faster and have memory capacity <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> times greater than their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</ENAMEX> counterparts .
There were many pioneer PC contributors .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Gates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Allen</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</ENAMEX> developed an early language - housekeeper system for PCs , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> became an industry billionaire <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> adapted one of these versions in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan F. Shugart</ENAMEX> , currently chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Seagate Technology</ENAMEX> , led the team that developed the disk drives for PCs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Hayes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Heatherington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> engineers , were co-developers of the internal modems that allow PCs to share data via the telephone .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> , the world leader in computers , did n't offer its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> PC until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1981</ENAMEX> as many other companies entered the market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , PC shipments <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</ENAMEX> total <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 38.3 billion</ENAMEX> world - wide .
