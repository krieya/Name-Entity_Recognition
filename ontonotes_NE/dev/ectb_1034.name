<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Kuan Yew</ENAMEX> Visits <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>
Senior Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Kuan Yew</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 23</ENAMEX> , and though he did not publicly comment on the purpose of his visit , observers everywhere speculated that he may have come as an intermediary between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> , who has been dubbed " the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> Godfather , " played a key role in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</ENAMEX> in bringing about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> round of talks between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koo Chen - fu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Daohan</ENAMEX> .
It remains to be seen whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> 's visit will bring any change in sensitive cross-strait relations , but President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Shui - bian</ENAMEX> revealed after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> 's departure that he and his guest had reached <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> points of consensus , including the need for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> free - trade zone .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - day</ENAMEX> series of closed - door meetings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> came to an end on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 26</ENAMEX> .
He met twice with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Shui - bian</ENAMEX> and had numerous contacts with a wide range of other leading members of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> society , including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang Fei</ENAMEX> -LRB- premier -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Ing - wen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mainland Affairs Council</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MAC</ENAMEX> ] chairwoman -RRB- , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MAC</ENAMEX> vice chairmen , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shi Huei - yow</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Straits Exchange Foundation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEF</ENAMEX> ] vice chairman -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuang Ming - yao</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Security Council</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NSC</ENAMEX> ] secretary - general , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiou I - jen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEF</ENAMEX> deputy secretary - general -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Yuan - tseh</ENAMEX> -LRB- chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Presidential Office 's</ENAMEX> inter-party task force for policy coordination -RRB- , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nita Ing</ENAMEX> -LRB- chairwoman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taiwan High - Speed Rail Corporation</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> also held in - depth discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kuomintang</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> -RRB- chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien Chan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">People First Party</ENAMEX> -LRB- PFP -RRB- chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> .
Although no one is saying so , it seems clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> 's visit focused primarily on cross-strait relations .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the most senior politicians in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> region , and a man who has had close ties with several generations of leaders on both sides of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Taiwan Strait</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Kuan Yew</ENAMEX> maintains a special status in both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
The news media have even taken to calling him a cross-strait mediator .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> said that the purpose of his whirlwind visit was only to get a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> - hand feel for the new administration .
" I was never a cross-strait mediator , " he stated categorically , " and I 've never said that I was . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MAC</ENAMEX> Vice Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Ming - tung</ENAMEX> sounded a similar note during interpellations at the legislature .
When asked whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Kuan Yew</ENAMEX> had come as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> 's emissary , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> said , " I can guarantee that he has not . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Ing - wen</ENAMEX> , who met twice with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> during his brief stay , added that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> has considerable political stature in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> and around the world , and his concern about cross-strait relations and the direction of policy in this regard is helpful to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> has also commented favorably on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lee</ENAMEX> 's visit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PRC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yuxi</ENAMEX> stated that while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> issue is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's internal matter , it welcomes efforts by anyone who upholds the " <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> " principle to bring about an early resolution .
It would thus appear that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> 's visit was welcomed by leaders on both sides of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Taiwan Strait</ENAMEX> , but in fact the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides did not actually share a common view on the matter .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's top concern was peace and stability , while mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> continually brought up the theme of unification .
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> 's trip would seem to have been a shot in the arm for the deadlocked cross-strait relationship , it also generated a lot of speculation and ill will because neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> nor anyone who met with him was willing to say a word about the content of their discussions , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> officials who went to call on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> at his hotel skulked around in underground walkways and service elevators to avoid journalists .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> 's stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> certainly left the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MOFA</ENAMEX> -RRB- with a bad taste in its mouth , for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MOFA</ENAMEX> was not involved in the visit in any way , and was n't even aware in advance that it was in the works .
That seemed quite odd , considering that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> is the founding father of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> and is still active as Senior Minister .
Many commentators blasted the way the visit was handled , and legislators described the affair as a serious breach of protocol .
Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tien Hung - mao</ENAMEX> was quoted as saying , " I feel a bit kicked around . "
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> broke the silence after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> left , stating at a function in honor of model public servants that he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Kuan Yew</ENAMEX> had reached <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> agreements , namely that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> should : -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> -RRB- sign <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">a " Singapore - Taiwan Free Trade Zone Agreement</ENAMEX> " ; -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> -RRB- lend impetus to financial cooperation , especially a possible exchange rate agreement ; and -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</ENAMEX> -RRB- effect telecommunication and Internet alliances .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> further stated that after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> joins <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the World Trade Organization</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WTO</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> , as fellow members of that select group of economic overachievers that journalists have come to dub " the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</ENAMEX> Tigers , " should stop viewing each other as competitors and move toward a friendly division of labor .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> also stressed : " Senior Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> is not a mediator .
He is not pushing any particular viewpoint , and he is no one 's mouthpiece . "
Cross-strait relations , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> , were just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of many issues that he discussed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> .
It may be that the pursuit of economic and trade relations is the only way to get <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> onto the path toward a resolution of the cross-strait stalemate .
Separate entry into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WTO</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> may be the best opportunity for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides to settle upon a " no unification , no independence " modus vivendi .
It seems apparent that mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is the only place where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's traditional industries can survive .
Even high - tech industries are slowly making their way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PRC</ENAMEX> .
Uncertainty in cross-strait relations will inevitably hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's economy .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Kuan Yew</ENAMEX> describes the debate between " <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> " versus " <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> as a point for discussion " and other such issues as mere semantics , and says that only history can bring the cross-strait issue to a resolution .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> of his memoirs , which were published in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> writes : " <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> people on both sides of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Taiwan Strait</ENAMEX> can reduce friction by building a relationship that is a bit more acceptable to both sides . "
We ought to use <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> 's visit as an opportunity to take stock of our current situation and further clarify our policy vis - a - vis mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , thereby bringing about an improvement in cross-strait relations .
Therein lies the most concrete significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> 's trip .
