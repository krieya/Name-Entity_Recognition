There was , of course , a team of attorneys on both sides of this live network coverage over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</ENAMEX> of this trial going on in the courtroom in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> , and , of course , among the teams of lawyers on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> side , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the leaders , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Ginsberg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the lawyers who argued the case in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Leon County Circuit Court</ENAMEX> .
He 's with us <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> , victorious in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tallahassee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX> , whatever the outcome <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , and you were on the upside , you are forced now to go along with the appeals process as is the right of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> team .
What is your reaction to the work that will cause ?
Well , I mean , we 're certainly prepared to -- to brief all the issues .
I think that the -- the circuit court judge , Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sauls</ENAMEX> gave a very well reasoned and thorough , both legal and factual discussion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> law .
Well , let 's talk about your statement <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">earlier today</ENAMEX> that -- that the Vice President -- I guess you were asked should the Vice President concede , and you answered , the Vice President should do what 's best for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> .
Is that what you 're trying to say ?
Well , sure .
I mean , I think that all the people involved in this unique -- this unique situation , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time a presidential election in our history has been contested , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian</ENAMEX> , need to do the right thing , and I 'm sure do the right thing , as they see fit .
Do you think the judge there , in addition to just giving out his ruling at the end of the court session <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , he went on beyond the basic issues and added reason upon reason for why he turned down the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> case .
Do you think his method there was to try to make this more or less appeal proof ?
Well , I think what he did was addressed the situation as it exists in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> and addressed the contingencies that were raised in the voluminous briefs that he had , not only from the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> party candidates involved , but also of the interveners who were in the case .
As you know , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> line throughout is they wo n't be happy until every vote is counted , and we could n't help but notice , should we call it a rhetorical device you used when talking to reporters <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">this afternoon</ENAMEX> .
Pause and listen along with us to the following piece of videotape .
Those ballots have been counted not once on <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">election night</ENAMEX> but twice in the recount and how many did you -- did you say there were ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,750</ENAMEX> --
If you know the exact number , does n't that mean they 've been counted ?
So I do n't suppose that was any accident on your part ?
Well , they have been making this point throughout these proceedings that these ballots have never been counted , and that is factually not true .
They have been counted on <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">election night</ENAMEX> -- they 've been counted in the recounts , and it simply happens to be not -- not the case that those ballots have failed to be counted by anyone .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX> , for better or worse , you are forced now to follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> team as they take you on a kind of trail of appeal here .
If you were asked to predict whether this stops at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> , what would your prediction be ?
I think it 's one of those situations where I would have predicted all , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian</ENAMEX> .
I think that the decisions are not ours to make .
We 'll be involved in all the legal processes obviously as long as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> campaign keeps them up , no matter how long that takes .
Ben Ginsberg , attorney for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> team , victorious <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tallahassee</ENAMEX> .
Thank you very much , after a long day , for being with us <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> .
Thanks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian</ENAMEX> .
