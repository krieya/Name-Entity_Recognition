The new ad plan from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Newsweek</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Washington Post Co.</ENAMEX> , is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> .
Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Newsweek</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Time Warner Inc. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Time magazine</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mortimer B. Zuckerman 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. News -AMP- World Report</ENAMEX> .

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. News</ENAMEX> has yet to announce its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> ad rates .

Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Newsweek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. News</ENAMEX> have been gaining circulation in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers , such as telephones or watches .
However , none of the big <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> weeklies recorded circulation gains recently .
