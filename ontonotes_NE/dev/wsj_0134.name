A man from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration came before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House Agriculture Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> to talk about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's intention to send <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 100 million</ENAMEX> in food aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> , with more to come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> .
The committee 's members are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> 's own farmers .
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Ackerman</ENAMEX> noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> .
However well intentioned , food transfers have the habit of growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient country 's own farmers .
The First World has for some time had the bad habit of smothering other people 's economies with this kind of unfocused kindness .
It should be constantly stressed that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> 's farmers mostly need a real market for their products .
