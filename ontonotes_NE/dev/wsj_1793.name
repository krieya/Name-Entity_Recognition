Corporate efforts to control health - care costs by requiring evaluations prior to planned hospitalization and surgery have n't been sweeping enough to reduce the long - term rate of cost increases , according to a study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Institute of Medicine</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</ENAMEX> , many corporations have embraced the `` utilization management '' cost containment strategy as a way to control health - care costs for employees .
These programs vary widely , but often require <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> opinions on proposed surgery , preadmission reviews of elective hospitalizations and reviews of treatment during illnesses or recovery periods .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Between 50 % and 75 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's workers are covered by such plans , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</ENAMEX> .
`` Although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers , utilization management -- like most other cost containment strategies -- does n't appear to have altered the long - term rate of increase in health - care costs , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Institute of Medicine</ENAMEX> , an affiliate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Academy of Sciences</ENAMEX> , concluded after a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> study .
`` Employers who saw a short - term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends . ''
While utilization management frequently reduces hospitalization costs , these savings are often offset by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs , according to the report by a panel of health - care experts .
The report suggested that current review programs are too narrow .
`` The unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital , and not the actual need for a particular procedure , has been the main focus , '' the panel said .
`` As a general rule , prior - review programs have not made case - by - case assessments of the comparative costs of alternative treatments or sites of care . ''
The report said that utilization management should have more of an impact as federal research on the effectiveness of medical treatments helps lead to medical practice guidelines .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Bailit</ENAMEX> , a panel member and a vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Aetna Life -AMP- Casualty</ENAMEX> , said that utilization management will also do a better job of containing costs as it spreads to cover medical services delivered outside of hospitals .
`` There 's pretty good evidence that utilization management has reduced inappropriate hospitalization , '' he said .
But at the same time , spending on physician services and ambulatory care have mushroomed .
`` It 's like squeezing a balloon , '' Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bailit</ENAMEX> said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Rahill</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">A. Foster Higgins -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization management reduces their hospital care bills by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 %</ENAMEX> , but he agreed that for the health - care system as whole , some of these savings are offset by administrative and outpatient care costs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Grossman</ENAMEX> , chairman of the panel , agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high .
`` You have a whole staff standing ready '' to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment , he said .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grossman</ENAMEX> , who also is president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New England Medical Center Hospitals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> , noted that the hospitals he runs deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</ENAMEX> utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements .
The panel urged greater efforts to reduce the complexity , paperwork and cost of utilization review .
`` Utilization management needs to better demonstrate that it reduces the wasteful use of resources , improves the appropriateness of patient care and imposes only reasonable burdens on patients and providers , '' the panel concluded .
