<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Boston Globe</ENAMEX> says its newly redesigned pages have a `` crisper '' look with revamped fixtures aimed at making the paper `` more consistent '' and `` easier to read . ''
Maybe so -- if you can find where your favorite writer went .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beantown</ENAMEX> scribes , who spare no invective when taking on local luminaries such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael `` Pee Wee '' Dukakis</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New England Patriots</ENAMEX> Coach <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond `` Rev. Ray '' Berry</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> poured ridicule on new drawings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Globe</ENAMEX> columnists that replaced old photos in the revamped pages <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">late last night</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Globe</ENAMEX> Managing Editor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Mulvoy</ENAMEX> , bending to the will of his troops , scrapped the new drawings .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</ENAMEX> at least , he says , no pictures or drawings of any kind will adorn the columns .
Trouble was , nobody thought they looked right .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Globe</ENAMEX> columnist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Barnicle</ENAMEX> -- in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> attack on his employer in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">as many weeks</ENAMEX> -- averred that his shadowy countenance was so bad , it looked `` like a face you 'd find on a bottle of miracle elixir that promises to do away with diarrhea in our lifetime . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnicle</ENAMEX> reminded readers that he still has n't forgiven <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Globe</ENAMEX> management for questioning a $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">20</ENAMEX> expense chit he submitted for parking his car while chasing a story .
`` I thought -LCB- the drawing -RCB- a cross between someone you 'd spot whipping open his trench coat ... or a guy who boasted he 'd been <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Manson 's</ENAMEX> roommate for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 19 years</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnicle</ENAMEX> was hardly kinder to the renderings of colleagues <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Madden</ENAMEX> -LRB- `` appears to be a pervert '' -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will McDonough</ENAMEX> -LRB- `` looks as if he drove for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abe Lincoln</ENAMEX> '' -RRB- or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bella English</ENAMEX> , whose `` little girl now screams hysterically every time she sees a newspaper . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynn Staley</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Globe</ENAMEX> 's assistant managing editor for design , acknowledges that the visages were `` on the low end of the likeness spectrum . ''
Rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boston Herald</ENAMEX> columnist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howie Carr</ENAMEX> , who usually rails at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Statehouse</ENAMEX> `` hacks '' and nepotism , argued that the new drawings were designed to hide Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madden</ENAMEX> 's `` rapidly growing forehead '' and the facial defects of `` chinless '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Shaughnessy</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Globe</ENAMEX> sports columnist .
`` But think of the money you , the reader , will save on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Halloween</ENAMEX> , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnicle</ENAMEX> .
`` Instead of buying masks for your kids , just cut out the columnists ' pictures ... .
