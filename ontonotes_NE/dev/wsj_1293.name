The tougher new regulations under the savings - and - loan bailout law are accelerating the thrift industry 's shrinking act .
Largely to meet tougher new capital requirements , thrifts reduced their assets <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.4 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , by selling such assets as mortgage - backed securities and loans .
Industry assets as of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 31</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.31 trillion</ENAMEX> , the lowest since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1988</ENAMEX> .
As thrifts sell assets to improve their capital - to - asset ratio , as required under the new law passed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , they must also reduce liabilities , such as deposits .
As interest rates paid depositors were lowered , thrift withdrawals exceeded deposits by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.1 billion</ENAMEX> , not including interest credited to accounts .
It was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third consecutive month</ENAMEX> in which thrifts shed assets to increase the size of their capital in relation to their assets , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Office of Thrift Supervision</ENAMEX> said .
The asset shrinkage was particularly concentrated in several large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> institutions .
`` The downsizing of the thrift industry is well under way , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bert Ely</ENAMEX> , an industry consultant in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va</ENAMEX> .
`` This suggests the bailout law is having a more dramatic effect than anyone would have imagined so soon . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Barth</ENAMEX> , an economist with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Office of Thrift Supervision</ENAMEX> , also attributed some of the outflow to seasonal factors .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</ENAMEX> when people are paying school tuition , '' he said .
`` That and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry . ''
Not including thrifts under government conservatorship , S-AMP-Ls reduced their assets by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.1 billion</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous month</ENAMEX> , and deposit outflows totaled <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.9 billion</ENAMEX> .
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">264</ENAMEX> insolvent thrifts under government management at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of August</ENAMEX> , assets declined by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.3 billion</ENAMEX> and withdrawals exceeded deposits by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2 billion</ENAMEX> .
Thrifts raised capital mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage - backed securities , which were reduced by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.8 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the prior month</ENAMEX> .
As of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 31</ENAMEX> , thrifts held <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 185 billion</ENAMEX> in mortgage - backed securities .
The deposit numbers for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> marked a swing back to huge outflows after a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> net deposit inflow of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 54 million</ENAMEX> -- the only net inflow in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a year</ENAMEX> .
Deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future , as the industry continues to shrink .
`` I think we are going to see deposit shrinkage continue , unless we see big changes in rates , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ely</ENAMEX> said .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first eight months of 1989</ENAMEX> , thrifts ' withdrawals exceeded deposits by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 44.5 billion</ENAMEX> .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the prior year</ENAMEX> , deposits exceeded withdrawals by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.8 billion</ENAMEX> .
