Good <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</ENAMEX> .
That call to order you just heard reverberates through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</ENAMEX> that the justices convene , but <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> was no everyday session .
Never before has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United States Supreme Court</ENAMEX> taken up a case that could decide a presidential election .
It did today .
That session of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> defeats for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> courts dominate the news <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
We start with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> , specifically at issue , an appeal from the campaign of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Florida Supreme Court</ENAMEX> had exceeded its authority when it ruled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> counties could have more time to hand - count ballots .
Throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour and a half</ENAMEX> of argument , the justices were aggressive in peppering lawyers with questions , and they seemed interested on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> issues .
Was there a federal issue involved that would even require <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to rule ? and if so , did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Florida Supreme Court</ENAMEX> improperly rewrite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> law , as Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> contends ?
A sure sign of the historic nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> 's proceeding , for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time ever , the court immediately released an audiotape of the arguments .
But in the courtroom , listening in person was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Judd</ENAMEX> .
Even now , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</ENAMEX> after that hearing ended , there are still protesters circling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> .
As boisterous as the protesters were , nothing intruded on the ritual inside .
The chief justice and the associate justices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court of the United States</ENAMEX> .
The courtroom was packed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore 's</ENAMEX> top campaign aides , his children , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> senators and congressmen , they were all there .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> save <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> and this honorable court .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> up , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Olson</ENAMEX> lawyer for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> , laying out the campaign 's main claim .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olson</ENAMEX> made it through <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">only 56 seconds</ENAMEX> of his arguments before a justice broke in .
Well , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olson</ENAMEX> --
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra Day O'Connor</ENAMEX> , often the swing vote on this court , demanded to know why the court even had a role in this case .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olson</ENAMEX> argued that a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">century - old</ENAMEX> federal statute prevents laws governing an election from being created after the fact which , he claimed , is just what the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> court did , and also , that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the U.S. Constitution</ENAMEX> gives state legislatures , not the courts , the right to choose electors .
Of all the justices it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</ENAMEX> who seemed most sympathetic to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Florida Supreme Court</ENAMEX> .
Midway through the hearing , Chief Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rehnquist</ENAMEX> seemed to scold his colleagues for being too talkative when he made an unusual offer to the lawyer representing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> 's Attorney General .
And so it went on .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Tribe</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> 's attorney , said the state court did nothing illegal .
It simply provided a way for a close election to be examined .
Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Connor</ENAMEX> again , but this time suggesting the state court had overstepped its authority and perhaps there was a federal case here .
Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonin Scalia</ENAMEX> also pressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tribe</ENAMEX> .
He said the state court relied on <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Florida Constitution</ENAMEX> to draft its decision , excluding state lawmakers and that violated <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the U.S. Constitution</ENAMEX> .
It was Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breyer</ENAMEX> who asked the most straightforward question of all .
What happens if the court rules in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> ?
The answer from the Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> 's lawyer was , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> wins and all the litigation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> ends .
Not everyone agrees .
They say that no matter which way the court rules , it will not provide nearly so much finality to this presidential election .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX> ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Judd</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> .
Our thanks .
