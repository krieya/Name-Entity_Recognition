On we go in the meantime .
Again , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , there were disturbing hints , and we underscore hints here , that coalition forces may soon face an attack using chemical weapons .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> the story centered on intelligence regarding enemy intentions .
Today the evidence is somewhat more tangible .
Reporting for us , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Ensor</ENAMEX> .
Reporter :
The evidence is accumulating that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> may be planning to use chemical weapons .
Gas masks turning up in abandoned trenches .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nasiriyah</ENAMEX> in a building marked as a hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Marines</ENAMEX> found weapons , atropine antidote kits , and that was not all .
They found <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 3,000</ENAMEX> chemical suits and gas masks as well as a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> military uniforms .
Reporter :
The findings are heightening concerns among coalition forces approaching <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> since , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> should know , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> forces do not use chemical weapons .

There is also intelligence , officials say , suggesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Republican Guard</ENAMEX> units have been issued artillery shells containing chemical agents .
There has been intelligence scraps , who knows how accurate they are , chatter in the system , that suggests that the closer that coalition forces get to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tikrit</ENAMEX> the greater the likelihood and that some command and control arrangements have been put in place .
Reporter :
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> Deputy Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tariq Aziz</ENAMEX> repeated his government 's stand -- it does not have any kind of weapons of mass destruction .
Translator :
When they started to talk about the weapons of mass destruction , we know and we always knew that that was fabrication and lies .
Reporter :
Experts say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein 's</ENAMEX> forces will likely try to hold out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> for as long as possible without using the weapons his government insists it does not have , hoping to build international pressure on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> to back down .
