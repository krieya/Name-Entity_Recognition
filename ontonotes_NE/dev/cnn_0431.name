Comes with someone involved in case of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">22 - year - old</ENAMEX> disabled woman in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> .
They talk about her current predicament .
A mind of toddler , raped while in state care , pregnant , and forced in the spotlight when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeb Bush</ENAMEX> tried to get a guardian appointed for her fetus .
Predicament goes hard enough to describe that .
To continue a pregnancy that her lawyer says she is not aware of but the decision was n't based on the advice of the governor .
Here 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Candyioti</ENAMEX> .
Reporter :
We know her only by her initial , this mother - to - be , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JDS</ENAMEX> .
Only <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">22 years old</ENAMEX> with no known family .
Police say she has the mental capacity of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1 - year - old</ENAMEX> .
According to court filing , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JDS</ENAMEX> has cerebral palsy and she 's autistic .
She did n't become pregnant by choice , she was raped , police say in a group home overseen by the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JDS</ENAMEX> is now <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than six months</ENAMEX> pregnant .
Since she 's incapable of making her own decision , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> judge based his decision on below to give birth on the recommendation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> doctors agreed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JDS</ENAMEX> is , `` in good health . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> sonograms reveal , no obvious or significant fetal abnormalities .
Although , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JDS</ENAMEX> is autistic , a guardian says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JDS</ENAMEX> appears to be responsive not just sitting in a semiconscious state all the time .
Still undecided , an appeal by Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeb Bush</ENAMEX> , who wants the guardian apointed for the fetus .
He says the unborn child must be protected .
However , a spokesman for the governor says he calls the court ruling for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JDS</ENAMEX> , not to abort the baby , compassionate and humane .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> , a judge ordered an abortion for another severely disabled raped woman who had been living in a state - regulated home .
In that case , the young woman 's mother approved the abortion .
And in this case , there are a lot of unanswered questions still .
For example , what will happen to the baby , and what will happen to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JDS</ENAMEX> ?
Of course , according to the guardian , she 's very worried about that , too , and she has warned the court that she hopes the mother will be placed in a better home when all of this is over , one where she is far better protected than she was by the state in a home where police say she was raped .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aaron</ENAMEX> ?
Well , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> questions .
Do they know who the rapist is ?
That 's sort a yes or no , I suppose .
And the other is , Has the state done anything ?
Is it doing anything to tighten up security in these places with respect defenseless people are being attacked ?
Reporter :
Well , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> of all , regarding the rape , they hope to find out who the father is once she gives birth because they will analyze DNA from the baby in order to try to determine paternity in this case , and the governor has ordered a panel of experts now to study this issue of security .
Far better security than is clearly needed for people such as this woman , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JDS</ENAMEX> , living in group homes .
Well , we will wait for the report .
Thank you , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Candiotti</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> .
Coming up on `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Newsnight</ENAMEX> , '' a cease - fire in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> , is there one or is it lots of talk .
Actions say different .
We 'll talk to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> legal representative , their legal adviser when we continue from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
