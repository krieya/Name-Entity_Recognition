<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> scientists said they discovered an antibody that , in laboratory test - tube experiments , kills AIDS - infected cells while preserving healthy cells .
If further experiments are successful , the work would represent a major advance in research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome .
The drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AZT</ENAMEX> , the only treatment currently on the market , claims only to help stop the spread of AIDS , not to cure it .
But several analysts and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> scientists familiar with the study , which was announced at a conference in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagoya</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , expressed skepticism over the significance of the results .
And the researchers themselves acknowledged they still must do much more work before they can say whether the treatment would actually cure humans .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shin Yonehara</ENAMEX> , a research scientist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science</ENAMEX> , said the antibody he discovered works by recognizing an antigen called a Fas - antigen , which is characteristic of an infected cell .
The antibody then kills the cell .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yonehara</ENAMEX> and his partner , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nobuyuki Kobayashi</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yamaguchi University</ENAMEX> , said their experiments showed that the antibody wiped out an average of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> of AIDS - infected cells within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</ENAMEX> .
In some of the experiments , it killed almost all the infected cells , the researchers said .
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fewer than 10 %</ENAMEX> of the healthy cells were killed .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> said they must still do more laboratory tests , then experiment on animals .
They said they hoped to conduct tests on human patients in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late next year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> does n't have enough AIDS patients to do significant experimentation in that country , they said .
The announcement got wide exposure in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> media , and even moved some pharmaceutical stocks <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takashi Kitamura</ENAMEX> , director of the biology department at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Institute of Health</ENAMEX> and secretary of the government 's AIDS - research center , said , `` I 'm not so optimistic of its future use in therapeutic methods . ''
He said some infected cells may not have the relevant antigen and so would n't be killed even after exposure to the antibody .
`` The results seem to be very premature , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitsuru Miyata</ENAMEX> , editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nikkei Biotechnology</ENAMEX> , a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> industry newsletter .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kobayashi</ENAMEX> responded that he thought the antibody could potentially kill all infected cells .
But he and Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yonehara</ENAMEX> said there were still several uncertainties , particularly regarding possible side effects .
`` Our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose , but it can also kill other cells , '' said Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yonehara</ENAMEX> .
`` We do n't know the effect of our antibody on the human body . ''
AIDS is n't considered a widespread problem in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> -- the government reports <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1,000</ENAMEX> known carriers of the virus -- but many companies have poured substantial resources into research in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , hoping to cash in on a possible cure .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kitamura</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 35</ENAMEX> projects are currently under way in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> researchers in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</ENAMEX> have made available <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> possible cures to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> researchers for clinical tests .
He said that when scientists from the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries meet again in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> will present <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</ENAMEX> more drugs for human testing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AZT</ENAMEX> is the world 's only prescription medicine approved for treating the disease .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wellcome PLC</ENAMEX> , a major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical maker , sells the drug under the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Retrovir</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wellcome</ENAMEX> spokesman declined to comment on the discovery of the antibody in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Porter</ENAMEX> , a drug - industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nikko Securities Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> , said if the product were to be successfully developed it would represent `` a potential threat to the long - term viability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Retrovir</ENAMEX> .
