As we said , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christine Todd Whitman</ENAMEX> stepped down and now a whole lot of analysis is taking place as to why she stepped down , the job she 's done when she was in office and the job that has yet to be complete .
From our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> bureau as I was introducing a moment ago , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Fagen</ENAMEX> , the environment writer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">News Day</ENAMEX> .
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitman</ENAMEX> did consider herself sort of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> environmentalist , but now there 's been an awful lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Monday night</ENAMEX> quarterback quarterbacking taking place now that she 's stepped down .
What do you suppose took place here ?
I think many people have watched this administration in action and watched <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christy Whitman</ENAMEX> in action .
The mystery is that she took the job in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> place or did n't leave earlier .
She was quite a misfit for this administration , and she showed that over and over .
She was not good at all at communicating the administration 's message to the public and certainly to the environmental groups and she was even worse at bringing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EPA</ENAMEX> bureaucracy , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EPA</ENAMEX> environmental policy makers ' message to this administration because she saw herself undercut over and over .
That 's interesting because leading into it , while she was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> governor , she sued the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EPA</ENAMEX> and she was very much considering herself to be an environmentalist , and then only to end up becoming the head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EPA</ENAMEX> and then of course , there was a lot of criticism over relaxed regulations .
Let 's hear what she had to say <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Wednesday</ENAMEX> here on CNN just after announcing her resignation .
I 'm not leaving because of clashes with the administration , in fact , I have n't had any .
I report to the President , and he has always asked me to give him my best unadulterated advice .
We have have been on the same page .
I was never supportive of protocol because it did n't do what everyone needs to get done as far as climate change is concerned .
I 'm leaving now because it 's the appropriate time to do it .
Dan , do you agree with that ?
She says the appropriate time .
Do you suppose for personal reasons or perhaps she was out of step with the administration ?
I 'm sure that it was difficult for her personally , but I think the commuter marriage perhaps would have been less stressful if everyday she did n't see herself being undermined and overruled .
I mean if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christy Whitman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> were on the same page , I do n't think I 've seen a book large enough to contain a page that big .
Over and over there were many , many instances over the last --
