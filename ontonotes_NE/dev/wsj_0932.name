The amount of blood surgical patients can donate and store before surgery can be increased by the new genetically engineered drug , EPO .
EPO , or erythropoietin , is a protein the human body makes to stimulate the growth of red blood cells .
A genetically engineered version of the human protein developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Amgen Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thousand Oaks</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , recently has been marketed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ortho Pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX> division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Johnson -AMP- Johnson</ENAMEX> .
A competing version of EPO is being developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Genetics Institute Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX> .
The drug is being used primarily to treat anemias .
A new experiment , reported in this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New England Journal of Medicine</ENAMEX> , involved giving injections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Amgen</ENAMEX> 's EPO to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</ENAMEX> patients who wanted to store units of their own blood .
The patients began receiving EPO injections <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month</ENAMEX> before their scheduled surgery .
They then began donating blood <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</ENAMEX> a week , receiving an EPO injection each time .
If tests indicated a low number of red cells , blood was n't taken .
The EPO - treated patients donated an average of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.4</ENAMEX> units of blood each compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 4.1</ENAMEX> units donated by a similar group of surgical patients who received a placebo injection .
The volume of red cells donated by the EPO - treated patients was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41 %</ENAMEX> higher per donor , the research team representing a number of hospitals and blood banks reported .
