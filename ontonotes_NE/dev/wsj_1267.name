In a nondescript office building south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , human behavior is being monitored , dissected and , ultimately , manipulated .
A squiggly line snakes across a video screen , gyrating erratically as subjects with hand - held computers register their second - by - <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">second</ENAMEX> reactions to a speaker 's remarks .
Agreement , disapproval , boredom and distraction all can be inferred from the subjects ' twist of a dial .
In another experiment , an elaborate chart with color codes reveals how people 's opinions were shaped -- and how they can be reshaped .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Vinson</ENAMEX> , who oversees the experiments , is n't some white - coated researcher .
He heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Litigation Sciences Inc.</ENAMEX> , the nation 's largest legal consulting firm , which is helping corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> prepare for high - stakes litigation by predicting and shaping jurors ' reactions .
In the process , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> is quietly but inexorably reshaping the world of law .
Little known outside the legal world but a powerhouse within , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi -AMP- Saatchi PLC</ENAMEX> , employs <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</ENAMEX> psychologists , sociologists , marketers , graphic artists and technicians .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty - one</ENAMEX> of its workers are Ph. D.s .
Among other services , the firm provides pre-trial opinion polls , creates profiles of `` ideal '' jurors , sets up mock trials and `` shadow '' juries , coaches lawyers and witnesses , and designs courtroom graphics .
Much like their cohorts in political consulting and product marketing , the litigation advisers encourage their clients to play down complex or ambiguous matters , simplify their messages and provide their target audiences with a psychological craving to make the desired choice .
With jury verdicts getting bigger all the time , companies are increasingly willing to pay huge sums for such advice .
Recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> helped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pennzoil Co.</ENAMEX> win a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.5 billion</ENAMEX> jury verdict against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texaco Inc</ENAMEX> .
It advised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Football League</ENAMEX> in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United States Football League</ENAMEX> .
And it helped win defense verdicts in product - liability suits involving scores of products , ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Firestone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">500</ENAMEX> tires to the anti-nausea drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bendectin</ENAMEX> .
Largely as a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> has more than doubled in size in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</ENAMEX> .
Its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> revenue was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 million</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , competitors are being spawned <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">almost daily</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 300</ENAMEX> new businesses -- many just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - person shops -- have sprung up .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinson</ENAMEX> estimates the industry 's total revenues approach <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</ENAMEX> .
In any high - stakes case , you can be sure that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> side or the other -- or even both -- is using litigation consultants .
Despite their ubiquity , the consultants are n't entirely welcome .
Some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists ' vision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen .
In the film classic `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Twelve Angry Men</ENAMEX> , '' the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror 's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</ENAMEX> of conflict and debate , that jury focuses on the facts with near - perfect objectivity .
In real life , jurors may not always work that way , but some court observers question why they should n't be encouraged to do so rather than be programmed not to .
Litigation consulting is , as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> trial attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Zoeller</ENAMEX> puts it , `` highly manipulative . ''
He adds , `` The notion they try to sell is that juries do n't make decisions rationally .
But the effort is also being made to try and cause jurors not to decide things rationally .
I find it troubling . ''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zoeller</ENAMEX> also acknowledges that consultants can be very effective .
`` It 's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough , it 's almost malpractice not to use them , '' he says .
Others complain that the consultants ' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services .
`` The affluent people and the corporations can buy it , the poor radicals -LCB- in political cases -RCB- get it free , and everybody in between is at a disadvantage , and that 's not the kind of system we want , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amitai Etzioni</ENAMEX> , a prominent sociologist who teaches at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">George Washington University</ENAMEX> .
Sophisticated trial consulting grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1960s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1970s</ENAMEX> before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases .
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">The Harrisburg 7 trial</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</ENAMEX> , in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Berrigan</ENAMEX> and others were charged with plotting anti-war - related violence , was a landmark .
In that case , a group of left - leaning sociologists interviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">252</ENAMEX> registered voters around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Harrisburg</ENAMEX> .
The researchers discovered that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Episcopalians</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Presbyterians</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Methodists</ENAMEX> and fundamantalist <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Protestants</ENAMEX> were nearly always against the defendants ; the lawyers resolved to try to keep them off the jury .
The defense also learned that college - educated people were uncharacteristically conservative about <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Vietnam War</ENAMEX> .
A more blue - collar panel became a second aim .
Ultimately , that carefully picked jury deadlocked with a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> - 2 vote to acquit , and the prosecution decided not to retry the case .
Litigation consulting had arrived .
The fledgling science went corporate in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> hired a marketing professor to help defend a complex antitrust case .
The problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> trial lawyers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Barr</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boies</ENAMEX> was how to make such a highly technical case understandable .
As the trial progressed , they were eager to know if the jury was keeping up with them .
The solution devised by the professor was to hire <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> people who would mirror the actual jury demographically , sit in on the trial and report their reactions to him .
He then briefed Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barr</ENAMEX> , who had the chance to tilt their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</ENAMEX> 's presentation accordingly .
Thus , the `` shadow '' jury was born .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinson</ENAMEX> , the professor , got the law bug and formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> .
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> won the case . -RRB-
`` The hardest thing in any complex case is to retain objectivity and , in some sense , your ignorance , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cravath , Swaine -AMP- Moore</ENAMEX> .
`` What you look for in a shadow jury is very much what you do when you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it .
A shadow jury is a way to do that in a more systematic and organized way . ''
The approach worked well in the recent antitrust case in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Energy Transportation Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Santa Fe Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> over the transport of semi-liquefied coal -- the kind of case likely to make almost anyone 's eyes glaze over .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Energy Transportation retained Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> , at a cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">several hundred thousand dollars</ENAMEX> , to poll , pre-try , profile and shadow .
Just before the actual closing arguments , the firm put the case to a vote of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> shadow jurors , each of whom was being paid $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">150</ENAMEX> a day .
The jurors , who did n't know which side had retained them , decided for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Energy Transportation</ENAMEX> , and awarded <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</ENAMEX> in damages .
The real jury returned <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">days later</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 345 million</ENAMEX> victory for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Energy Transportation</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's just like weather forecasting , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Energy Transportation</ENAMEX> trial attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Reasoner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vinson -AMP- Elkins</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's often wrong , but it 's better than consulting an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> rain dancer . ''
Forecasting is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</ENAMEX> part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Litigation Sciences '</ENAMEX> work .
Changing the outcome of the trial is what really matters .
And to the uninitiated , some of the firm 's approaches may seem chillingly manipulative .
Theoretically , jurors are supposed to weigh the evidence in a case logically and objectively .
Instead , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinson</ENAMEX> says , interviews with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of jurors reveal that they start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try to shoe - horn the facts of the case to fit their views .
Pre-trial polling helps the consultants develop a profile of the right type of juror .
If it is a case in which the client seeks punitive damages , for example , depressed , underemployed people are far more likely to grant them .
Someone with a master 's degree in classical arts who works in a deli would be ideal , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> advises .
So would someone recently divorced or widowed .
-LRB- Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> generally represents the defense , its job is usually to help the lawyers identify and remove such people from the jury . -RRB-
For personal - injury cases , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> seeks defense jurors who believe that most people , including victims , get what they deserve .
Such people also typically hold negative attitudes toward the physically handicapped , the poor , blacks and women .
The consultants help the defense lawyers find such jurors by asking questions about potential jurors ' attitudes toward volunteer work , or toward particular movies or books .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> does n't make moral distinctions .
If a client needs prejudiced jurors , the firm will help find them .
As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinson</ENAMEX> explains it , `` We do n't control the facts .
They are what they are .
But any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy to employ .
In our system of advocacy , the trial lawyer is duty bound to present the best case he possibly can . ''
Once a jury is selected , the consultants often continue to determine what the jurors ' attitudes are likely to be and help shape the lawyers ' presentation accordingly .
Logic plays a minimal role here .
More important are what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LSI</ENAMEX> calls `` psychological anchors '' -- a few focal points calculated to appeal to the jury on a gut level .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> personal - injury case , a woman claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a pool , but the fall did n't explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of her arms was discolored bluish .
By repeatedly drawing the jury 's attention to the arm , the defense lawyers planted doubt about the origin of the woman 's injuries .
The ploy worked .
The defense won .
In a classic defense of a personal - injury case , the consultants concentrate on encouraging the jury to shift the blame .
`` The ideal defense in a case involving an accident is to persuade the jurors to hold the accident victim responsible for his or her plight , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinson</ENAMEX> has written .
Slick graphics , pre-tested for effectiveness , also play a major role in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Litigation Sciences '</ENAMEX> operation .
Studies show , the consultants say , that people absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it visually .
Computer - generated videos help .
`` The average <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> watches <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">seven hours</ENAMEX> of TV a day .
They are very visually sophisticated , '' explains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LSI</ENAMEX> graphics specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Seltzer</ENAMEX> .
Lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this .
Supporters acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate , but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics .
`` They may not have been able to articulate it all , but they did it , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Gillers</ENAMEX> , a legal ethics expert at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New York University</ENAMEX> law school .
`` What you have here is intuition made manifest . ''
Many lawyers maintain that all 's fair in the adversary system as long as no one tampers with the evidence .
Others point out that lawyers in small communities have always had a feel for public sentiment -- and used that to advantage .
Litigation consulting is n't a guarantee of a favorable outcome .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> concedes that in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> cases it was flatout wrong in its predictions .
A few attorneys offer horror stories of jobs botched by consultants or of overpriced services -- as when one lawyer paid a consultant -LRB- not at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> -RRB- $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">70,000</ENAMEX> to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more informative interviews with the same jurors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The American Lawyer</ENAMEX> magazine .
Some litigators scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury tick .
`` The essence of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Ostrager</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Simpson Thacher -AMP- Bartlett</ENAMEX> , who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shell Oil Co</ENAMEX> .
He says he used consultants in the case but `` found them to be virtually useless . ''
But most lawyers accept that the marketplace has spoken .
And the question remains whether the jury system can maintain its integrity while undergoing such a skillful massage .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a decade</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Etzioni</ENAMEX> , the sociologist , has been a leading critic of the masseurs .
`` There 's no reason to believe that juries rule inappropriately , '' he says .
`` But the last thing you want to do is manipulate the subconscious to make them think better .
What you then do is you make them think inappropriately . ''
To hamper the work of litigation scientists , he suggests that courts sharply limit the number of jurors that lawyers can remove from the jury panel through so - called peremptory challenges -- exclusions that do n't require explanations .
In most civil cases , judges allow each side <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> such challenges .
For complex cases , judges sometimes allow many more .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Etzioni</ENAMEX> also suggests forbidding anyone from gathering background information about the jurors .
-LRB- Some courts release names and addresses , and researchers can drive by houses , look up credit ratings , and even question neighbors . -RRB-
Furthermore , he says , psychologists should not be allowed to analyze jurors ' personalities .
Even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boies</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> lawyer to use Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinson</ENAMEX> 's services , cautions against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning -LRB- known as voir dire -RRB- or giving out personal information about the jurors .
`` The more extensive the voir dire , the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective , and I do n't think courts should lend themselves to that , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boies</ENAMEX> says .
