Posting station : BBS Unnamed space station -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thu Feb 1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">23:53:45</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2007</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> people are descendants of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Han</ENAMEX> race -LRB- proved by modern genetics -RRB- , and they inherited their culture from us as well .
More or less they can somehow talk practically and realistically .
Before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year N</ENAMEX> , most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Koreans</ENAMEX> were the descendants of northwestern nomads ; they were pressured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Han</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">N years</ENAMEX> , and they bear animosity .
If in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">those years</ENAMEX> the " Great <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East Asian</ENAMEX> Circle of Common Glory " is unfortunately achieved , it should be a bit more bearable than in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Manchus</ENAMEX> shaved our heads .
For the long - term , if we let the descendants of the overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Han</ENAMEX> come to force the Great <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East Asian</ENAMEX> Circle of Glory , it wo n't be as good as if we make it happen ourselves .
Then we 'll send troops to be stationed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> and follow the system of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Manchus</ENAMEX> from those times , setting up a frankpledge system , with the bride spending her wedding night with the lord of the frankpledge .
Restoring those olden days will ensure that everybody on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Korean</ENAMEX> peninsula is a descendant of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Han</ENAMEX> race , ^_^ .
