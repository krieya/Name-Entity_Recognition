<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 400,000</ENAMEX> commuters trying to find their way through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Bay area 's</ENAMEX> quake - torn transportation system wedged cheek - to - jowl into subways , sat in traffic jams on major freeways or waited forlornly for buses <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
In other words , it was a better - than - average <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> commute .
City officials feared widespread gridlock on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</ENAMEX> that normal business operations were resumed following <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Tuesday 's</ENAMEX> earthquake .
The massive temblor , which killed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 61</ENAMEX> people , severed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> , a major artery to the east , and closed most ramps leading to and from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 101</ENAMEX> , the biggest artery to the south .
It will take <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</ENAMEX> to repair the bridge , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</ENAMEX> to repair some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">101</ENAMEX> connections .
But in spite of a wind - driven rainstorm , gridlock never materialized , mainly because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bay Area Rapid Transit</ENAMEX> subway system carried <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> more passengers than normal .
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time in memory , it was standing - room only in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BART</ENAMEX> 's sleek , modern railcars .
Moreover , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> main bridges still connecting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the East Bay</ENAMEX> did n't charge tolls , allowing traffic to zip through without stopping .
Officials also suspect that traffic benefited from steps by major employers to get workers to come in at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">odd hours</ENAMEX> , or that many workers are still staying at home .
Many commuters who normally drove across <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> , which is shut down for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</ENAMEX> because of damage to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> span , actually may have reached work a bit faster on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BART</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , provided they could find a parking space at the system 's jammed stations .
In the best of times , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> is the worst commute in the region , often experiencing back - ups of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">20 to 30 minutes</ENAMEX> or more .
Not that getting into town was easy .
Storm flooding caused back - ups on the freeway , and many commuters had to find rides to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BART</ENAMEX> 's stations , because parking lots were full before dawn .
Bus schedules were sometimes in disarray , stranding commuters such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn Sullivan</ENAMEX> .
Her commute from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Petaluma</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , normally takes <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour and 15 minutes</ENAMEX> , via <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Golden Gate Bridge</ENAMEX> , which connects <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">North Bay</ENAMEX> area .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , she was still waiting at a bus stop after <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</ENAMEX> , trying to transfer to a bus going to the financial district .
`` It 's worse than I thought , '' she said .
`` I do n't know where all the buses are . ''
But while traffic was heavy early in the commute over <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Golden Gate</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">8 a.m.</ENAMEX> it already had thinned out .
`` It 's one of the smoothest commutes I 've ever had , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Catania</ENAMEX> , an insurance broker on the bus from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mill Valley</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marin County</ENAMEX> .
`` It looks like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a holiday</ENAMEX> .
I think a lot of people got scared and stayed home . ''
However , a spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BankAmerica Corp.</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's absenteeism at the bank holding company was no greater than on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">an average day</ENAMEX> .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the San Mateo Bridge</ENAMEX> , which connects the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> peninsula with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the East Bay</ENAMEX> , police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved .
`` Everybody pretty much pitched in and cooperated , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan Perez</ENAMEX> , a sergeant with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the California Highway Patrol</ENAMEX> .
There were many indications that <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the new work hours</ENAMEX> implemented by major corporations played a big role .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">The Golden Gate</ENAMEX> handled as many cars as normally <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , but over <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</ENAMEX> rather than the usual <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">two - hour</ENAMEX> crush .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bechtel Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , the giant closely held engineering concern , says it has instituted a <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">6 a.m. to 8 p.m.</ENAMEX> flextime arrangement , whereby employees may select any <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">eight - hour</ENAMEX> period during <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">those hours</ENAMEX> to go to work .
Of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bechtel</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,500</ENAMEX> employees , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 4,000</ENAMEX> work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one - third</ENAMEX> of them commuting from stricken <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East Bay</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pacific Gas -AMP- Electric Co.</ENAMEX> is offering its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> employees a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - tier flextime schedule -- either <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">6 a.m. to 2 p.m.</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10 a.m. to 6 p.m</ENAMEX> .
The flextime may cut by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost a third</ENAMEX> the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PG-AMP-E</ENAMEX> employees working conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">9 - 5 hours</ENAMEX> , a spokesman says .
Some of the utility 's employees may opt for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a four - day workweek</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10 hours</ENAMEX> a day , to cut the commute by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</ENAMEX> .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pacific Telesis Group</ENAMEX> , flextime is left up to individual working groups , because some of the telephone company 's employees must be on - site during <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">normal business hours</ENAMEX> , a spokeswoman says .
Some individuals went to some lengths on their own to avoid the anticipated gridlock .
One senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bechtel</ENAMEX> said he got up at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">3 a.m.</ENAMEX> to drive into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the East Bay</ENAMEX> .
But transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last .
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> transportation official said drivers who did n't use car pools were committing `` an anti-social act , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two - thirds</ENAMEX> of the motorists crossing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Golden Gate</ENAMEX> were alone , compared with the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</ENAMEX> rate .
And some commuters , relieved by the absence of gridlock , were planning to return to their old ways .
