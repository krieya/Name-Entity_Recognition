Do n't jump yet .
The stock market 's swoon may turn out to be good news for the economy .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">one wild hour</ENAMEX> of trading , the market managed to accomplish what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration has been trying to do , unsuccessfully , for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</ENAMEX> .
It is forcing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar .
The resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could reinvigorate <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> business -- indeed , the entire economy .
This may sound strangely optimistic .
After all , until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</ENAMEX> , the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy .
When it went down , by all tradition , the economy followed .
That has changed , partly because <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the two years</ENAMEX> following the worst stock - market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash was `` a false alarm however you view it , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">University of Chicago</ENAMEX> economist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Zarnowitz</ENAMEX> .
The market seems increasingly disconnected from the rest of the nation .
Its spasms ca n't be traced to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy .
`` The market <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> has a life of its own , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Akers</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> .
`` There 's nothing rational about this kind of action . ''
Of course , the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> .
Sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> now relies for financial sustenance .
The financial - services industry was battered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash .
What 's more , although the stock market is far less overvalued <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy is weaker .
Growth is slower .
Profits are softer .
Debt burdens are heavier .
But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> , which until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> had been resisting moves to ease credit , is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest - rate policies .
But the experience of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash suggests the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> is likely to bring down short - term interest rates in its effort to calm markets .
Anticipating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> 's move , money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the Federal Funds rate to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.625 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Friday</ENAMEX> , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.820 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> before .
Tiny movements in the rate , which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans , are usually among the few visible tracks that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> leaves on the monetary markets .
The dollar also began to decline <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors to reassess their desire to invest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> officials have been arguing for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> that the dollar 's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals , threatening to extinguish the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</ENAMEX> .
The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> was right about the overpriced dollar .
A modest drop in the dollar -- only a modest one , mind you -- would be welcomed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
That was n't the case in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse , producing panic among foreign investors and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
Another big difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> is n't so comforting .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third quarter of 1987</ENAMEX> , the economy spurted at an inflation - adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 %</ENAMEX> .
The consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.3 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third quarter of 1989</ENAMEX> , which ended <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ago</ENAMEX> .
The plunge in stock prices `` is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down , '' says economist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Chimerine</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WEFA Group</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bala Cynwyd</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , forecasting company .
`` A lot of pent - up demand is gone . ''
Consumer spending did drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the months</ENAMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Black Monday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> -- `` but only slightly and for a short period of time , '' recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zarnowitz</ENAMEX> , a longtime student of business cycles .
`` That was offset by strength elsewhere .
-LCB- The effects -RCB- were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected .
'' Today , he frets , exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> and if consumers retrench in reaction .
What 's more , the corporate borrowing binge has n't abated in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</ENAMEX> .
`` We 've had <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two more years</ENAMEX> of significant accumulation of debt ... just at the time when earnings are being squeezed , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chimerine</ENAMEX> notes .
The more a company relies on borrowed money , the greater its sensitivity to an economic slowdown .
A company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm ; a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> , of course , knows that very well -- hence its readiness to pump credit into the economy <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</ENAMEX> .
But , in the process , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> risks reigniting inflation .
Even before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's events , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvard University</ENAMEX> economist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Friedman</ENAMEX> was arguing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets , banks and highly leveraged corporations .
The biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession , he reasons ; it 's an outbreak of uncontrolled inflation .
In the end , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> collapse suggested , the economy does n't move in lockstep with stock prices .
The economy does , however , depend on the confidence of businesses , consumers and foreign investors .
A panic on Wall Street does n't exactly inspire confidence .
Surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</ENAMEX> - point drop is n't likely to make much of a dent ; multiply that a few times over , though , and it will .
If the reactions of executives gathered <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hot Springs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX> , for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Business Council</ENAMEX> meetings are typical , business leaders were n't overly rattled by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's decline .
And if foreign investors become a tad more cautious -- well , the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> can stand it .
On the bottom line , the most comforting fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years ago</ENAMEX> , about the only point of comparison was the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</ENAMEX> crash and the subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Depression</ENAMEX> .
The doomsayers had a receptive audience .
The prosperity that followed <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Black Monday</ENAMEX> permits a more optimistic view <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
At the very least , the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation 's success in handling the last go - around .
As Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> -RRB- observed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> avoided a meltdown last time .
They are more sophisticated this time .
