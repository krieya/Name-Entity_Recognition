The results so far have been good .
Where do these media professionals come from ?
What do they take home with them ?
Is this helpful in consolidating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> diplomatic relations ?
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Television News Seminar for Friendly Nations</ENAMEX> began on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February 21</ENAMEX> , and will last for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">19 days</ENAMEX> .

Through these activities , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GIO</ENAMEX> hopes to give these citizens from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> 's diplomatic - partner states both knowledge and warm hospitality .
Most of those attending this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> 's course come from anglophone countries in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Caribbean Basin</ENAMEX> .

<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</ENAMEX> high - level media professionals , media owners , and front - line journalists are in attendance .
According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GIO</ENAMEX> , the study session is the result of agreements to boost journalistic exchange , and is an innovative and concrete way to implement these agreements .
Most of those attending hold high positions in their domestic media .
During their stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , they are not only introduced to media elites in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and to the local media environment and facilities , but can also gain a greater knowledge of the land and people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Republic of China</ENAMEX> .
This they can take home to share with their fellow citizens , thereby helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> 's diplomatic partners and their peoples to understand <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> better .
The sessions have been run by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Broadcasting Development Fund</ENAMEX> .
Lecturers are mainly broadcasting and journalism experts from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</ENAMEX> they include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kuan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Hsia</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jason Blatt</ENAMEX> .
The course includes classes on political broadcasting , international broadcasting information / propaganda strategies , and digital television broadcast development , as well as visits to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Central Broadcasting Corporation</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taiwan Television Corporation</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern TV</ENAMEX> , and other media outlets .
Generally speaking , the participants are very interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's high - tech industries and products .
Visits to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Kuanghua</ENAMEX> computer market have proven especially popular .
The visitors are generally favorably impressed by the prosperity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei City</ENAMEX> and by the consumer behavior of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> .
In a television interview , television news producer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus Bailey</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maitland TV</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grenada</ENAMEX> said that he has learned a great deal about the editing facilities and techniques used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> television , and that he would be able to apply this information in his own television production work when he returned home .
This experience , he said , has deepened his desire to get further involved in television production work .
He added that he would very much enjoy an opportunity to work together with colleagues from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> television .
Section chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Chu</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GIO</ENAMEX> , who has been involved in organizing the camp <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> times , says that all the participants are very satisfied with the course .
After returning home most of them produce newspaper accounts of their experience .
Unfortunately , it is very difficult for them to apply the technical infomation they learned , because in most cases they lack the hardware and facilities available in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
Thus they are only able to apply the theoretical insights they picked up to their own media work at home .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chu</ENAMEX> says that the concrete results of the course will only become visible with a longer time frame .
This is just like overall relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries : They can only be consolidated by a long period of continual exchange .

Butterflies , flying birds , swimming fish , and peacocks .
These may not have the flash of the large electrically lit lanterns found at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the CKS Memorial</ENAMEX> , but the traditional handmade lanterns at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Lungshan Temple</ENAMEX> have an enduring beauty all their own .
