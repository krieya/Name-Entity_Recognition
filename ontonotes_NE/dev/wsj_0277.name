Buying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller Group Inc.</ENAMEX> is right up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Estate Co. 's</ENAMEX> alley in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> sense : The huge <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> real estate company is entering a long - term relationship with a similarly conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> owner of tony urban property .
But in another sense , the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 846 million</ENAMEX> purchase is uncharacteristically nervy , industry analysts say .
The usually cautious giant will become the majority owner of the company that owns <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York 's</ENAMEX> beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rockefeller Center</ENAMEX> at a time when tensions over <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> purchases of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> property are at an all - time high .
Officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller Group</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> prefer to focus on the affinities , nearly dismissing the threat of a backlash from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> public .
`` We think there will be positive as well as negative reactions , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Pettit</ENAMEX> , senior vice president and chief financial officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller Group</ENAMEX> .
`` On balance , we think it will be positive . ''
But some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> government officials and businessmen worry that the prominent purchase is just the sort of deal that should be avoided for the time being .
In particular , they criticize the timing , coming as it does on the heels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony Corp. 's</ENAMEX> controversial purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc</ENAMEX> .
`` Officially , yes , we encourage the free flow of direct investment , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> official .
`` But they did n't have to choose this particular moment . ''
During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</ENAMEX> , government officials and leading business organizations have repeatedly urged <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> companies to refrain from flashy real estate purchases in the
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980s</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's other major real estate purchases in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dai - Ichi Seimei America Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 670 million</ENAMEX> purchase of an office building at 153 East 53rd St. in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsui Fudosan Inc. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 610 million</ENAMEX> purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Exxon Building</ENAMEX> , part of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rockefeller Center</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Arco Plaza</ENAMEX> was sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shuwa Corp.</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 620 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sumitomo Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> paid <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 million</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">IBM Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
Altogether , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> commercial real estate grew from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.3 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 7.1 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> .
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> companies have taken the warnings by the country 's leaders to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties .
Critics say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Estate 's</ENAMEX> decision to buy into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> reflects the degree to which companies are irritated by the pressure to act for the good of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
`` Those who have no money and are n't buying think it 's right to refrain , but those with money who want to buy for themselves pay no attention , '' says an official of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> - U.S . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Business Council</ENAMEX> .
But to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> , the acquisition has just the elements that should win support from both sides .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> of all , it is a friendly acquisition in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> sought out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> and asked it to buy a majority share .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> companies found a similarity in their business and development philosophies and intend to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications .
Finally , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> has no plans to interfere with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> 's management beyond taking a place on the board .
`` We 'll continue to work with them , in keeping with the reputation of the company , and we 'll rely very much on their leadership , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jotaro Takagi</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> may well have found its match in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> , a company of long history , strong government ties and sound resources .
In asset terms , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> is the largest real estate firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
The core of its holdings is <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">190,000 square meters</ENAMEX> of incredibly expensive property in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Marunouchi district</ENAMEX> , the business and financial center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , often jokingly called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mitsubishi Village</ENAMEX> . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> family company acquired that property from the government <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">some 100 years ago</ENAMEX> when it was a portion of samurai residential land running from the moat of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Imperial Palace</ENAMEX> east toward the hodgepodge of tiny shops and twisted alleys that made up the merchants ' district .
At the time , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> had just opened its doors to the world after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about 250 years</ENAMEX> of isolation and needed a Western - style business center .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> built the government 's dream development , the story goes , in exchange for the official decision to locate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> 's central railway station there .
That was just an early step in a relationship with government that has earned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> group the dubious moniker of `` seisho , '' literally government - business , a title that has the pejorative connotation of doing the government 's bidding , but also suggests the clout inherent in maintaining such close ties .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</ENAMEX> of companies in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> group .
It 's known for its cautiousness in part because it has had little need for bold overseas ventures : In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year ended March 31</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57.4 %</ENAMEX> of its total revenue came from office building management .
Its earnings can rise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % to 12 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</ENAMEX> simply from the natural turnover of tenants and automatic rent increases , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graeme McDonald</ENAMEX> , an industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">James Capel Pacific Ltd</ENAMEX> .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the latest fiscal year</ENAMEX> , the company 's net income jumped a robust <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">35.5 billion yen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250.2 million</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> purchase will catapult it firmly into the overseas real estate business , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> area where it has lagged notably behind <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> competitors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsui</ENAMEX> , which had purchased <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Exxon Building</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> companies need to invest in overseas real estate for diversification , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoshio Shima</ENAMEX> , an industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Goldman Sachs -LRB- Japan -RRB- Corp</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> is n't the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> overseas purchase for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> -- it has already played a leading role in designing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Citicorp Plaza</ENAMEX> .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> investment is its largest .
Nonetheless , it will barely make a dent in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Estate 's</ENAMEX> finances , analysts say .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> has n't decided how it will raise the funds for the purchase , which are due in cash <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next April</ENAMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marunouchi</ENAMEX> holdings alone are estimated to have a market value of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as 10 trillion yen</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">11 trillion yen</ENAMEX> .
Moreover , as a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> group , which is headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's largest banks , it is sure to win a favorable loan .
Analysts say the company also could easily issue new convertible bonds or warrants .
Meanwhile , at home , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> has control of some major projects .
It is the largest private - sector landowner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Minato - Mirai 21</ENAMEX> project , a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">multibillion - yen</ENAMEX> development in the port city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yokohama</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">about an hour</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> .
The project is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of a select group of public projects opened to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> firms under a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - Japan construction trade agreement reached <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
The centerpiece of that complex , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Landmark Tower</ENAMEX> , will be <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's tallest building when it is completed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> is also pushing ahead with a controversial plan to redevelop <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marunouchi</ENAMEX> into a business center of high - tech buildings , a project budgeted for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">six trillion yen</ENAMEX> .
