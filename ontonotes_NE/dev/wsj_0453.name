The commercial was absolutely silent .
Breaking into the raucous Chicago Bears - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cleveland</ENAMEX> Browns match during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> football game , it was nothing but simple block letters superimposed on the TV screen .
`` Due to the earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> is donating its commercial air time to broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Red Cross</ENAMEX> Emergency Relief messages .
Please contribute what you can , '' the ad said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> logo flashed on the screen for a moment , and then came a taped plea for donations from former President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> -- followed by the silent print telling viewers where to call .
Within <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</ENAMEX> , viewers pledged over $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">400,000</ENAMEX> , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Red Cross</ENAMEX> executive .
Call it disaster marketing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan Motor</ENAMEX> is just one of a slew of advertisers that have hitched their ads to the devastating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> quake and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .
Sometimes , the ads attempt to raise money ; always , they try to boost good will .
By advertising disaster relief , these companies are hoping to don a white hat and come out a hero .
But the strategy can backfire ; if the ads appear too self - serving , the companies may end up looking like rank opportunists instead of good Samaritans .
That has n't deterred plenty of companies .
Along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grand Metropolitan PLC 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Burger King</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New York Life Insurance</ENAMEX> have tied ads to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Red Cross</ENAMEX> donations .
Other ads do n't bother with the fundraising ; a touching , if self - congratulatory , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Telephone -AMP- Telegraph</ENAMEX> ad that aired <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> intermixed footage of the devastation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charleston</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.C.</ENAMEX> , with interviews of people recounting how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> helped .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> , `` we felt we wanted to do something to help them gather <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">money</ENAMEX> , and we had this airtime on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Monday Night Football</ENAMEX> , '' explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooke Mitzel</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> advertising creative manager .
`` What did we get out of it ?
We got some exposure ... and pretty much good will . ''
The ads are just the latest evidence of how television advertising is getting faster on the draw .
While TV commercials typically take <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</ENAMEX> to produce , advertisers in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past couple of years</ENAMEX> have learned to turn on a dime , to crash out ads in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">days</ENAMEX> or even <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</ENAMEX> .
The big brokerage houses learned the art of the instant commercial after the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash , when they turned out reassuring ads inviting investors right back into the stock market .
They trotted out another crop of instant commercials after the sudden market dip <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks ago</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> created its quake ad in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a weekend</ENAMEX> .
But as advertisers latch onto disasters with increasing frequency , they risk hurting themselves as much as helping the cause .
They chance alienating the customers they hope to woo by looking like opportunistic sharks .
`` People see extra messages in advertising , and if a manufacturer is clearly trying to get something out of it ... if it 's too transparent ... then consumers will see through that , '' warns <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Philip Jones</ENAMEX> , chairman of the advertising department at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Newhouse School of Public Communications</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Syracuse University</ENAMEX> .
`` It can backfire because companies can step across the line and go too far , be too pushy , '' agrees <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Stibel</ENAMEX> , a principal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New England Consulting Group</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Westport</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Conn</ENAMEX> .
`` The ultimate form of charity is when you do n't tell anyone . ''
Still , he says that only a few of the quake - related campaigns have been `` tasteless '' and that `` the majority have been truly beneficial to the people who need the help .
We do n't consider that ambulance chasing . ''
The companies running the disaster ads certainly do n't see themselves as ambulance chasers , either .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Burger King 's</ENAMEX> chief executive officer , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Gibbons</ENAMEX> , stars in ads saying that the fast - food chain will donate <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Red Cross</ENAMEX> for every purchase of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Doubles</ENAMEX> hamburger .
The campaign , which started <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> and runs through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 23</ENAMEX> , with funds earmarked for both the quake and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX> , `` was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> 's idea , '' a spokeswoman says .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> felt very committed .
He felt we should be giving something back . ''
While the campaign was Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gibbons</ENAMEX> 's idea , however , he wo n't be paying for it : The donations will come out of the chain 's national advertising fund , which is financed by the franchisees .
And by basing donations on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Doubles</ENAMEX> , a new double - hamburger line the fast - food chain is trying to push , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Burger King</ENAMEX> works a sales pitch into its public - service message .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota</ENAMEX> 's upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> division , a sponsor of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the World Series</ENAMEX> , also put in a plug for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Red Cross</ENAMEX> donations in a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Series</ENAMEX> game it sponsored .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">The World Series</ENAMEX> is brought to you by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> , who urges you to help relieve the suffering caused by the recent earthquake ... , '' the game announcer said .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New York Life</ENAMEX> made a plea for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Red Cross</ENAMEX> donations in newspaper ads in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area , latching onto the coattails of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Red Cross 's</ENAMEX> impeccable reputation : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Red Cross</ENAMEX> has been helping people for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">125 years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New York Life</ENAMEX> has been doing the same for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">over 140 years</ENAMEX> . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Craig</ENAMEX> , advertising manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Red Cross</ENAMEX> , readily admits `` they 're piggybacking on our reputation . ''
But she has no problem with that , she says : `` In the meanwhile , they 're helping us . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Red Cross</ENAMEX> does n't track contributions raised by the disaster ads , but it has amassed <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 46.6 million</ENAMEX> since it first launched its hurricane relief effort <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 23</ENAMEX> .
