<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lara</ENAMEX> hijacking in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> has been captured by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> forces in or near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> .
This was the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Italian</ENAMEX> ship that was taken -- that was captured by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> terrorists back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> and some may remember the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Clinghover</ENAMEX> .
He was in a wheelchair and the terrorists shot him and pushed him over the side of the ship into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> where he obviously , died .
This man , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Abbas</ENAMEX> has lived an itinerant life , he 's been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tunas</ENAMEX> , he 's been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX> and he 's been living under the protection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> , but he is wanted for murder in Italy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> .
There are charges , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> charges which have expired but could , I am told , possibly be re -- restarted for piracy , hostage taking and conspiracy .
So this is one of the oldest cases of terrorism that is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the oldest cases that has not been closed to date .
Now looks as if this man <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Absaas</ENAMEX> is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> hands .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX> ?
