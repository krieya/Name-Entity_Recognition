There are some bad habits that a great majority of people have .
They think there is no harm in them , and that they are even good habits , though they might put our health on the edge .
We can mention some of them in brief below :
drinking tea after eating .
It is known that tea contains tannin , a substance that inhibits the absorption of iron by the intestines , which deprives the body of it .
Consequently , the body could become anemic .
There is no doubt that tea is beneficial at more than one level , but we should be cautious of excessive drinking of it , as its detriments could outweigh its benefits
It is better to drink tea outside of meal times .
As for the quantity , it ranges from two <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">to three</ENAMEX> cups per day , no more .
Whoever drinks more , has only himself to blame .
Using frying oil over and over .
Frying oil repeatedly makes it oxidize and , as a result it releases compounds that are harmful to the body , especially to the arteries .
Moreover , research has shown that these compounds play a role in causing cancer .
The best thing that can be done is to throw away oil after frying in it for the first time .
Some try to add new oil to old oil .
This is like the saying " pouring oil on fire . "
Adding salt to meat before it is grilled .
This habit is very bad , because salt absorbs water from the meat , and this drains the minerals and vitamins from it , particularly iron .
Meat should first be grilled and then the salt added to it .
