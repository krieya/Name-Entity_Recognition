This city is girding for gridlock <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</ENAMEX> of commuters avoid travel routes ravaged by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week 's</ENAMEX> earthquake .
Estimates of damage in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> - county <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area neared <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion</ENAMEX> , excluding the cost of repairing the region 's transportation system .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">The Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> , the main artery into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> from the east , will be closed for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at least several weeks</ENAMEX> .
Part of the bridge collapsed in the quake , which registered <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.9</ENAMEX> on the Richter scale .
The bridge normally carries <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</ENAMEX> commuters a day .
Also , most of the ramps connecting the city to its main link to the south , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">101</ENAMEX> freeway , have been closed for repairs .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bay Area Rapid Transit</ENAMEX> system , which runs subway trains beneath the bay , is braced for a doubling of its daily regular ridership to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300,000</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BART</ENAMEX> has increased service to <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</ENAMEX> a day in preparation for the onslaught .
Most unusual will be water - borne commuters from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East Bay</ENAMEX> towns of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX> .
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">32 years</ENAMEX> , ferry service has been restored between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the East Bay</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Red and White Fleet</ENAMEX> , which operates regular commuter ferry service to and from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marin County</ENAMEX> , and tourist tours of the bay , is offering <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East Bay</ENAMEX> commuters a chance to ride the waves for the price of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</ENAMEX> round - trip .
That tariff is too stiff for some <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Financial District</ENAMEX> wage earners .
`` I 'll stay with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BART</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> secretary , swallowing her fears about using the transbay tube .
Officials expect <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Golden Gate Bridge</ENAMEX> to be swamped with an extra load of commuters , including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East Bay</ENAMEX> residents making a long detour .
`` We 're anticipating quite a traffic crunch , '' said one official .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 23,000</ENAMEX> people typically travel over <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Golden Gate Bridge</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">commute hours</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 130,000</ENAMEX> vehicles cross during a <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">24 - hour</ENAMEX> period .
Meetings canceled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Apple Computer Inc. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> sales force and by other groups raised the specter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants .
It also raised hackles of the city 's tourism boosters .
`` Other cities are calling -LCB- groups booked here for tours and conferences -RCB- and -- not to be crass -- stealing our booking list , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Shafer</ENAMEX> , a spokesman for Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Agnos</ENAMEX> .
City officials stuck by their estimate of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</ENAMEX> in damage to the quake - shocked city .
The other <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Bay area</ENAMEX> counties have increased their total damage estimates to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.8 billion</ENAMEX> .
All estimates exclude highway repair , which could exceed <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> .
Among the expensive unknowns are stretches of elevated freeway in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> that were closed because of quake - inflicted damage .
The most worrisome stretch is <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.2 miles</ENAMEX> of waterfront highway known as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Embarcadero Freeway</ENAMEX> .
Until it was closed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> , it had provided the quickest series of exits for commuters from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> heading into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Financial District</ENAMEX> .
Engineers say it will take <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at least eight months</ENAMEX> to repair the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Embarcadero</ENAMEX> structure .
As part of the quake recovery effort , the city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Building Department</ENAMEX> has surveyed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3,000</ENAMEX> buildings , including all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Financial District 's</ENAMEX> high - rises .
The preliminary conclusion from a survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</ENAMEX> downtown high - rises is that `` we were incredibly lucky , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Kornfield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco 's</ENAMEX> chief building inspector .
While many of these buildings sustained heavy damage , little of that involved major structural damage .
City building codes require construction that can resist temblors .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Leach</ENAMEX> , a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lloyd 's of London</ENAMEX> , said the insurance market has n't yet been able to estimate the total potential claims from the disaster .
`` The extent of the claims wo n't be known for some time , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leach</ENAMEX> said .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , during a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> to survey quake damage , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> promised to `` meet the federal government 's obligation '' to assist relief efforts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> officials plan to ask <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</ENAMEX> or more of federal aid , in the form of grants and low - interest loans .
The state has a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> reserve , and is expected to add <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> to that fund in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next year</ENAMEX> .
Some of that money will be available for highway repair and special emergency aid , but members of the legislature are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax to raise money for earthquake relief .
However , state initiatives restrict the ability of the legislature to raise such taxes unless the voters approve in a statewide referendum .
