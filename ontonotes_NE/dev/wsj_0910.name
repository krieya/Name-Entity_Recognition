The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> government , with a view to becoming more politically active in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Latin America</ENAMEX> , is expected to announce tomorrow its application to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Organization of American States</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> - based regional agency .
The expected <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> move has been welcomed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration even though <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> has opposed such <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> actions as the trade embargo against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> , the invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grenada</ENAMEX> and the military support for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Contra</ENAMEX> guerrillas .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Latin American</ENAMEX> countries have long urged <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OAS</ENAMEX> in the hopes that it would be a counterweight to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , which for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</ENAMEX> tended to dominate the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</ENAMEX> - nation organization .
Even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> also has supported <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> membership , it has n't been a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> priority .
`` The fact that we might not side with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> may be a reason why <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> 's membership in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OAS</ENAMEX> has n't been , over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</ENAMEX> , an item high on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> agenda , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allan Gotlieb</ENAMEX> , former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> ambassador to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> application is expected to be announced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mulroney</ENAMEX> , who is attending a centenary celebration of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Costa Rican</ENAMEX> democracy .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the hemisphere , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mulroney</ENAMEX> said recently .
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> political commentators have opposed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> 's joining what they see as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - dominated organization .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> could do plenty of things to get serious about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Latin America</ENAMEX> without running the risk of getting caught in the cross fire '' between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Latin American</ENAMEX> members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OAS</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Simpson</ENAMEX> , a columnist in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Globe -AMP- Mail</ENAMEX> newspaper .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> , at times , could be an awkward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OAS</ENAMEX> partner for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> if its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Nations</ENAMEX> voting record is an indication .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.N. General Assembly</ENAMEX> votes <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> voted the same as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 63 %</ENAMEX> of the time .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> voted the same as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76 %</ENAMEX> of the time , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79 %</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Birns</ENAMEX> , director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Council on Hemispheric Affairs</ENAMEX> , a liberal research group , said that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Latin American</ENAMEX> countries would be `` profoundly disappointed '' if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> were to follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> lead in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OAS</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Latin Americans</ENAMEX> see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> as a non-interventionist power that respects their sovereignty , '' he said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OAS</ENAMEX> , which tries to promote peace and economic development within the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Americas</ENAMEX> , is attempting to find a settlement of the current <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> political crisis .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> has been suspended from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OAS</ENAMEX> membership , but the organization 's members are discussing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> 's reinstatement .
