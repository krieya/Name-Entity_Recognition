<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kay Peterson</ENAMEX> mounts her bicycle and grinds up yet another steep , rocky path seemingly suitable only for mountain goats .
After a tortuous climb , she is rewarded by a picture - postcard vista : a glade of golden aspens under an azure <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Indian - summer</ENAMEX> sky .
This place is <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 miles</ENAMEX> into the back country -- a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day - long</ENAMEX> trudge for a hiker , but reached by Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> others in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a mere two hours</ENAMEX> of pedaling fat - tired mountain bikes .
`` This , '' says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> , `` is what it 's all about . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Twelve hundred miles</ENAMEX> away , rangers at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Napa County</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , state park are among the many who do n't quite share the enthusiasm .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This summer</ENAMEX> , speeding bikers were blamed for an accident in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Napa County</ENAMEX> park , in which a horse -- spooked on a trail that was closed to bikers -- broke its leg .
The animal had to be destroyed ; the bikers fled and were never found .
In numerous parks near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , rangers have been forced to close trails , set up speed traps and use radar guns to curb fast and reckless riding .
They have even sent helicopters in pursuit of bikers after hikers and equestrians complained they were being driven from trails .
`` We were being overrun , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Fiala</ENAMEX> , trails coordinator of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the East Bay Regional Park District</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years ago</ENAMEX> , the district decided to limit the bikes to fire roads in its <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">65,000 hilly acres</ENAMEX> .
From <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 200,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six years ago</ENAMEX> , the number of mountain bikes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> is expected to grow to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least half</ENAMEX> that growth will have come in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</ENAMEX> alone .
The controversy kicked up by the proliferation of these all - terrain bicycles is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the most divisive storms to blow through the national conservation movement in recent memory .
Bikers -- many of them ardent environmentalists -- proclaim their sport an efficient , safe , fitness - promoting way to get back to nature , while asserting a right , as taxpayers , to pedal on public lands .
But the bikes ' burgeoning numbers , safety concerns and fear that they damage fragile landscapes have prompted pleas , from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Sierras</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Eastern Seaboard</ENAMEX> , to ban them from the back country .
Key to the issue is that the bikes , in skillful hands , can go virtually anywhere , and in reckless hands can become vehicles of terror .
An adept bicyclist can leap from a dead stop to the top of a picnic table without losing balance .
Such skills allow riders to fly down treacherous mountain grades at speeds of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to 40 miles an hour</ENAMEX> -- a thrill for the cyclist but a nightmare for unsuspecting hikers or equestrians .
For harried public - land managers across the nation , the response is increasingly to shut the gates .
The state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , following the lead of some regional parks , recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all hiking paths in state parks to mountain bicycles .
The move largely consigns them to roads used by motorized vehicles .
Most other states have enacted similar bans .
The bikes are unwelcome on trails in national parks .
Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Forest Service</ENAMEX> , whose lenient `` multiple - use '' philosophy permits motorized vehicles on <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands of miles</ENAMEX> of its trails across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , has begun to close some lands to the bikes , including major portions of the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pacific Crest Trail</ENAMEX> , which stretches from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> .
Often these closings come after vigorous anti-bike lobbying by conservation organizations , the politically potent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sierra Club</ENAMEX> among them .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sierra</ENAMEX> has been instrumental in securing a number of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> bans .
It has been waging an all - out campaign to beat back a proposal , pushed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> bike groups , to allow the cycles in federally designated wilderness areas , where they are now prohibited .
Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sierra</ENAMEX> 's hard - line stance has created something of a rift in the organization , which estimates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</ENAMEX> members own mountain bikes .
Pressure from these members prompted the club recently to soften its anti-bike rhetoric ; it no longer , for example , lumps the bikes into the same category as motorcycles and other terrain - marring off - road vehicles .
But the club still insists that public lands ought to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate the bikes wo n't injure the environment or other users .
`` I have a mountain bike , yet as a hiker I 've been run off the road by kids careening down a fire trail on them , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Coan</ENAMEX> , an official at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sierra</ENAMEX> 's headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , echoing the concerns of many members .
`` People who feel that cyclists should be banned from an area are n't looking at the whole picture , '' complains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Langton</ENAMEX> , associate editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mountain and City Biking</ENAMEX> magazine in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canoga Park</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Langton</ENAMEX> is among the legions of bikers who got their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> taste of wilderness as hikers or backpackers .
He says fellow bikers show the same concern for the land that they demonstrated as hikers ; many are appalled that the conservation community would suddenly consider them the enemy .
To fight back , activists such as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Langton</ENAMEX> are forming groups to lobby land managers over access issues and undertake education programs to show that the bikes can responsibly share trails .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Langton</ENAMEX> 's group , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Concerned Off - Road Bicyclists Association</ENAMEX> , mounted petition drives to help keep open certain <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Santa Monica Mountain</ENAMEX> trails designated for closing .
Biking groups in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> have won similar concessions , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Blumenthal</ENAMEX> , mountain bike editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bicycling</ENAMEX> magazine .
These groups have been trying to improve the mountain biker 's image ; in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> - area park district where a ranger was clobbered by a cyclist <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</ENAMEX> bikers have formed a volunteer patrol to help rangers enforce regulations , and to school riders in proper trail etiquette .
Even staunch anti-bike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sierra</ENAMEX> members concede that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> of all riders cause most of the problems .
While some are renegade riders who simply scorn regulations , much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that can be corrected through `` education and peer pressure , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Hasenauer</ENAMEX> , a director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Mountain Biking Association</ENAMEX> .
`` I think we 're making progress . ''
Few would have foreseen such a furor when , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade ago</ENAMEX> , some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marin County</ENAMEX> bicycle enthusiasts created a hybrid bike using fat tires , lightweight metallurgy and multi-gear technology .
They wanted a machine that would allow them to pedal into rugged terrain then inaccessible to cycles .
They got a machine more responsive , more stable and in many ways easier to ride than the thin - tired racing bikes that then were the rage .
When the bikes first entered mass production in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> , they were dismissed as a fad .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 million</ENAMEX> bicycles sold in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> were mountain bikes .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , a bellwether market , they accounted for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 80 %</ENAMEX> of all bike sales .
The majority of the bikes never even make it into the high country .
City dwellers love them because they shift smoothly in traffic , bounce easily over curbs and roll through road glass with far fewer flat tires than racing bikes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crested Butte</ENAMEX> , population <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,200</ENAMEX> , is a bastion of the sport .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> estimate , everyone here <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">under 50</ENAMEX> owns <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</ENAMEX> bike .
The town is home to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame</ENAMEX> and it hosts the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Fat Tire Bike Week</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This summer</ENAMEX> , the jamboree attracted more visitors than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the busiest week</ENAMEX> of the town 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">winter ski season</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Lindsey</ENAMEX> , chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Fat Tire Bike</ENAMEX> celebration , muses that the bike 's popularity may be a combination of technology and nostalgia .
`` The mountain bike feels as comfortable as the ` paperboy ' bike you had as a kid , but it can do so much more , '' he says .
