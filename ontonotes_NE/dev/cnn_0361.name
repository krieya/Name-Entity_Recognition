Night opens on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS John C. Stennis</ENAMEX> . ''

For <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the next 12 hours</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</ENAMEX> , planes from the carrier will fly missions over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> .

To adjust their eyes for night vision , crew members make their way through passageways glowing in dim red light .
On the flight deck , a walkover check for debris is lit only by flashlight .
The dangers of the flight deck being blown overboard by jets , slight sliced by propellers or other hazards that are hard enough to avoid in daylight are all the more intense at night .
The intricate coordination of launch and recovery plays out as a dance in the darkness .
The complexity of it all has been described as a ballet and if it is a ballet , the choreographer of the flight deck is this man here .
He is the handler .
