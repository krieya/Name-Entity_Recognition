There is a talk of bringing international aid workers back to the refugee camps of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Timor</ENAMEX> to help <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor 's</ENAMEX> refugees stranded there .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The United Nations</ENAMEX> and the government of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> are trying to work out a plan to do it , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VOA</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breck Ardery</ENAMEX> reports from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">UN</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Namibia</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> Ambassador <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Angava</ENAMEX> who recently lead a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Security Council</ENAMEX> delegation to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor</ENAMEX> and to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> , told reporters the plan involves a joint security assessment of conditions in the camps .
What we have proposed and the government of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> is willing to embark on discussions with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jakarta</ENAMEX> is for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> security experts to be sent to the camps and to assess the situation , and of course , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor</ENAMEX> perhaps as a whole , to assess the situation , together with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indonesian</ENAMEX> military and police , and it would be on the basis of their assessment that a decision would then be taken as to whether the humanitarian agents should go back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Timor</ENAMEX> or not .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angava</ENAMEX> said the government of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> has increased security in the refugee camps since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
There are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</ENAMEX> of refugees from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor</ENAMEX> in the camps , but the exact number is in dispute .
International relief workers were evacuated from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Timor</ENAMEX> after an incident on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 6th</ENAMEX> , in which <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> aid workers were killed .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indonesian</ENAMEX> government has arrested <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> people in connection with the murders .
The situation in the refugee camps of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Timor</ENAMEX> has been an ongoing source of concern for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> transitional administration in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor</ENAMEX> that is helping to prepare that territory for independence .
Numbers of anti-independence militia groups have been intimidating refugees and even sometimes crossing over into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor</ENAMEX> .
Despite the increased presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indonesian</ENAMEX> security forces in the camps , Ambassador <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angava</ENAMEX> says , there is evidence the militias still have a lot of influence .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angava</ENAMEX> says he and his delegation talked with some refugees who indicated they were reluctant to speak freely , because of the presence of the militias .
