The Human Resources Industry :
A Cooling Economy Heats Up the Competition
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teng Sue - feng</ENAMEX> / tr. by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Newell</ENAMEX> -RRB-
As the global economy enters a down - turn , unemployment , like an already - stretched balloon being filled relentlessly with air , threatens to burst and spoil the dream of economic security .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last October</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's unemployment rate surpassed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</ENAMEX> , and now <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 300,000</ENAMEX> people are jobless .
As the economy fades , business increases for human resources companies , so that the condition of the market for HR firms becomes a reflection of the overall employment situation .
It is estimated that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> , an ordinary person will change jobs an average of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> times in a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - 40 year</ENAMEX> working lifespan .
People revolve in a circle whose defining points are employment , job shifts , and unemployment .
So long as people want to find work or change their jobs , the human resources industry has a future .
And the rise of Internet technology has brought a revolution to this market which had changed so little for so long .
Take this job and ....
The largest human resources company in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the 104 Job Bank</ENAMEX> .
The firm 's name comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> number for directory assistance , and suggests that " To look for a job should be as easy as getting a phone number from the operator . "
The company currently has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 55,000</ENAMEX> jobs and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65,000</ENAMEX> job - seekers on file .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">104</ENAMEX> vice president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Su</ENAMEX> says that there are no reliable statistics for the value of the human resources market , because newspapers refuse to disclose their revenues from classified ads .
But , based on the spaces used and prices charged , it could reach as high as <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 10 billion</ENAMEX> , and even a conservative estimate would be <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 3 - 4 billion</ENAMEX> , of which <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> would be in the Internet employment services market .
An indicator of how good this market looks comes from the actions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Daily News</ENAMEX> group .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UDN</ENAMEX> is one of the investors behind a new employment magazine called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Biung</ENAMEX> , which is designed in the pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> employment magazines , and hit the market in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October of 2000</ENAMEX> .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UDN</ENAMEX> group also opened a website called " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">udnjob</ENAMEX> . "
Why does this venerable media giant look so favorably on the human resources market ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson Lee</ENAMEX> , vice-president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UDN - Biung</ENAMEX> , the company that publishes <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Biung</ENAMEX> , who has many years of experience in publishing , says that there is a limit to how many people are reached by classified advertising .
Based on a survey conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AC Nielsen</ENAMEX> , only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 3 %</ENAMEX> of individuals buy newspapers to read the classified ads .
Moreover , from a firm 's point of view , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> confesses , classified ads are " in fact rather expensive . "
It costs <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">over NT$ 10,000</ENAMEX> for an ad of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about five centimeters square</ENAMEX> .
From the newspaper 's point of view , classified ads are n't such a hot property either , since most of the profit goes to the middlemen who take the ads .
These limitations to the traditional job hunting formula are unlikely to be resolved in the short term , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> explains : " Looking at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> experience , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Asahi Shimbun</ENAMEX> has a daily circulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10 million</ENAMEX> , but only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> page of classified advertising .
Those looking for new jobs rely more on employment magazines . "
The attraction for similar magazines in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> is being helped along by the current fad for things <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> , and also by changes in how publications are being sold , with convenience stores getting publications on to the shelves much faster than traditional bookstores ever could .
" With changes in the larger environment and the maturing of the market , this is the time to jump in . "
" The economy is in a downturn , but the human resources market always goes against the current , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , where the " bubble economy " phenomenon has been the worst , there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of human resources firms competing .
The leading company had an after - tax income <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 90 million</ENAMEX> .
Though there have been suggestions that the Internet is already becoming the main way to find employment , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> contends that " the obstacles to entry are still great " for the ordinary person : You have to have a computer and be online , and you have to know how to find what you are looking for .
When you consider this , print media is still much more convenient .
The big get bigger
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> largest media groups in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , whose flagship papers are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Daily News</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the China Times</ENAMEX> , began invading the human resources market <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> , and existing job banks went on a binge of mergers .
For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Career Magazine</ENAMEX> , which has <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a decade</ENAMEX> of experience in the field , founded an e- counterpart , which then merged with the " <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">37</ENAMEX> " employment website -LRB- the resulting site is now called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">www.Career.com</ENAMEX> -RRB- to provide even more comprehensive services .
The big may have gotten bigger , but that has n't stopped newcomers from jumping into the fray .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Southeast Asia Group</ENAMEX> , which had previously specialized in bringing foreign labor to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the 1111 Manpower Bank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , focusing on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> main markets : education , civil service , finance , technology , and part - time work for students .
" The interesting thing about the job bank industry is that no rules of the game have yet taken shape for the Internet .
There is much room for change and flexibility , and no one can guess how much the market might change , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">1111</ENAMEX> public relations manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Miao</ENAMEX> .
Established firms start with the advantage that many people turn to them out of habit .
But their weakness is that they have information overload , with no special features .
" If latecomers want to transcend the old media , they have to try a different approach .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The 1111 Manpower Bank</ENAMEX> has adopted the strategy of ' surrounding the cities from the countryside , ' and is striving to work with small and medium - sized enterprises , " she explains .
Finding a profitable market niche is something that all the newcomers have in mind .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yam Digital Technology</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">InterServ International</ENAMEX> got together in a joint venture to establish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">HRGini</ENAMEX> , which targets middle - and high - ranking managers in high - tech fields who have incomes in excess of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">one million NT dollars</ENAMEX> per year .
Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Chen</ENAMEX> relates that the company employs state - of - the - art psychological profiling services , with job candidates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> being screened by a psychological consultant in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - on - <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> interviews ; only if the applicant fits the corporate culture will he or she be recommended to the client firm .
Looking to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Greater China</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> reason that people are so optimistic about the human resources market is the performance of the market leader - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">104 Job Bank</ENAMEX> .
It began turning a profit after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only one - and - a - half years</ENAMEX> in operation , and its revenues , which were already <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">over NT$ 100 million</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</ENAMEX> , shot up to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 300 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
The company had <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only five</ENAMEX> staff members when they set up shop in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> ; now , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only four years later</ENAMEX> , there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</ENAMEX> .
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">104</ENAMEX> has commissions from more firms than any other in the market , they do not dare slack off .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Su</ENAMEX> says that " we will always have competition from the traditional media like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">China Times</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Daily News</ENAMEX> , " because after all , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">104</ENAMEX> only works through the Internet .
He does not , however , fear the threat from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CTCareer</ENAMEX> website , which is under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">China Times</ENAMEX> flag , nor is there anything especially novel about the exploitation of both the Internet and magazine formats by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UDN</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Acer Peripherals</ENAMEX> invested in a combination website and magazine , but they exhausted their capital within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</ENAMEX> .
Moreover , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Su</ENAMEX> is skeptical about the survivability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UDN</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Biung</ENAMEX> , " since , at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 20</ENAMEX> per issue , they are selling at a loss . "
But the people at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UDN - Biung</ENAMEX> are very optimistic .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson Lee</ENAMEX> says : " Some people try to open the market with a shovel .
We are using a bulldozer . "
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UDN</ENAMEX> group is undertaking a three - pronged attack to crush their competition : continuing to access the wide readership of newspapers , targeting the high - tech sector through the Internet , and using the magazine format for regional companies with small budgets .
Based on past experience , most companies have used up their employment advertising budgets by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year 's end</ENAMEX> , so the market is at a low ebb .
However , when <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Chinese New Year</ENAMEX> passes , many employees , having collected their annual bonuses , want to change jobs , and this is when the market really heats up .
Although the manpower industry focuses on bringing together employers with job - seekers , there is much more to it these days than passing along CVs .
Firms now offer psychological screening , career - suitability evaluations , job training , and reassignment of staff .
Moreover , all these firms are turning their eyes toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Greater China</ENAMEX> market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The 104 Job Bank</ENAMEX> has been operating beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> for some time , having registered its trademark and set up a website in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PRC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> -LRB- though it uses <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</ENAMEX> in the mainland since that is the number of directory assistance there -RRB- .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">HRGini</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Chen</ENAMEX> says that there is a huge potential client base in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Asia - Pacific region</ENAMEX> for tech - savvy staff .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson Lee</ENAMEX> notes : " If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> can become the main axis of human resources management in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Greater China region</ENAMEX> , not only will this industry not be adversely affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's economic downturn , it will also not be hurt by the large - scale move by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> companies to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PRC</ENAMEX> . "
As we watch the race heating up between amalgamated veteran firms and ambitious newcomers , let us hope that the real winners turn out to be employers and job - seekers .

Magazines are also trying to get a piece of the job - hunting market .
p. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108</ENAMEX>
The husband has been laid off and there is no money for the children 's tuition .
What can one do ?
Women 's groups have protested at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Legislative Yuan</ENAMEX> , calling for more attention to the problem of unemployment .
The government will spend <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than NT$ 60 billion</ENAMEX> on infrastructure projects expected to create <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 40,000</ENAMEX> jobs .
