<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> Undersecretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Mulford</ENAMEX> defended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's efforts this fall to drive down the value of the dollar , saying it helped minimize damage from the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</ENAMEX> - point drop in the stock market <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 13</ENAMEX> .
Testifying before a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> subcommittee , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mulford</ENAMEX> said that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> had n't intervened in foreign - exchange markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early October</ENAMEX> to reduce the dollar 's value , the plunge in the stock market might have provoked a steep fall in the currency that might have `` unhinged financial markets . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mulford</ENAMEX> , responding to critics of intervention , also said intervention is `` highly visible , '' is taken seriously by financial markets and works better than `` was recognized some time ago . ''
Differences between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> on the usefulness of intervention to help restrain the dollar resurfaced at the hearing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> Vice Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Johnson</ENAMEX> , who had dissented from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's policy , told lawmakers , `` I became convinced about what looked to me like an attempt to push the dollar down against the fundamentals in the market . ''
Intervention , he added , is useful only to smooth disorderly markets , not to fundamentally influence the dollar 's value .
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John LaFalce</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y</ENAMEX> . -RRB- said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> refused to testify jointly with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mulford</ENAMEX> and instead asked to appear after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> official had completed his testimony .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> spokesman denied Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LaFalce</ENAMEX> 's statement .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mulford</ENAMEX> said reports of tension between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> have been exaggerated , insisting that they involved `` nuances . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> also said that `` in the scheme of things , these things are minor . ''
On other matters , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mulford</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> is contributing to imbalances in the world economy because of its success as an exporter .
`` The solution is stronger domestic growth -LCB- in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> -RCB- , '' he said .
But because the growth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> economy has been stronger than expected , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mulford</ENAMEX> said , it 's difficult for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> to argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> ought to adopt more stimulative monetary and fiscal policies .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> 's trade surplus is largely with other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> countries rather than with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mulford</ENAMEX> acknowledged .
But nonetheless <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> companies might be more successful in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> markets if not for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> export push , he said .
