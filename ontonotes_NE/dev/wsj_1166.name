Both issues are among the most popular with individual investors .
`` Because of shrinkage in the economy , rates can be expected to decline over a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one - year</ENAMEX> horizon , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norberto Mehl</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Banxquote</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon . ''
Changes in CD yields in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the week ended Tuesday</ENAMEX> were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two months</ENAMEX> .
Interest rates generally began declining <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last spring</ENAMEX> after moving steadily upward for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a year</ENAMEX> .

The brokerage firms , which negotiate rates with the banks and thrifts whose CDs they sell , generally feel they have to offer clients more than they can get on T - bills or from banks and thrifts directly .
T - bills sold at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> 's auction yielded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.90 %</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.77 %</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</ENAMEX> , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.82 % and 7.61 %</ENAMEX> , respectively , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the week before</ENAMEX> .
So - called jumbo CDs , typically in denominations of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">90,000</ENAMEX> and up , also usually follow T - bills and interest rate trends in general more than those aimed at small investors .
Some jumbos posted fractional changes in average yields <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> , both up and down .
The average yield on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">threemonth</ENAMEX> jumbos rose to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.00 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.96 %</ENAMEX> , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> average fell by the same amount to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.89 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Six - month</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">oneyear</ENAMEX> yields were unchanged , on average .
`` The -LRB- CD -RRB- market is unsettled right now , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Banxquote</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehl</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's very easily influenced by changes in the stock market and the junk bond market . ''
The small changes in averages reflect generally unchanged yields at many major banks .
Some , however , lowered yields significantly .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chase Manhattan Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , for example , the yield on a small denomination <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> CD fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a quarter</ENAMEX> of a percentage point to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.06 %</ENAMEX> .
