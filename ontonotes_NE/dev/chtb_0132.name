He said , on the contrary , that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , under the premise of strengthening its financial risk prevention and control , will increase capital utilization benefits and support developing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> - owned enterprise as targets , adhere to not changing reforms utilizing foreign capital , and at the same time will suitably re-adjust and perfect the policies of utilizing foreign capital .
According to reports by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the " People 's Daily "</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xiaoling Wu</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> will be an unforgettable year in the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> economic development .
The financial crisis in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East Asia</ENAMEX> undoubtedly will have greater impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> 's economic development .
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's economy and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's financial system were not directly impacted , currently , the RMB exchange rate is stable , the economy still grew rapidly and healthily according to the development plan , and the inflation rate was controlled at a relatively low level .
But , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> 's financial crisis will produce definite negative effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's economy and use of foreign capital .
We will further deepen financial system reform , strengthen the degree of financial supervision and management , and limit financial risk , to reduce the detrimental effects created by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> 's financial crisis on us to the lowest degree .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xiaoling Wu</ENAMEX> also revealed that , henceforth , in the area of overseas debt issuance , we will implement policy re-adjustments and improvements in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> areas .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , debt issuance bodies will diversify .
Besides insisting that financial institutions be the main foreign financing channels , there will be a few special large - scale state - owned enterprises with good international reputations , with high standards of multinational operations , that have good asset - to - debt ratios , and good benefits , that enter the international capital market to implement debt issuance .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</ENAMEX> , bond structures will diversify .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> of experimentation , issuance methods and features of transferable bonds are accepted domestically .
Henceforth , the main lending bodies will optimize financing structures according to their characteristics and market demand , in making choices in areas such as transferrable bonds , bonds and bank loans , and will systematically develop issuance of project financing bonds , ABS , etc. , that have no recall or limited recall rights , thereby reducing the pressure of financial institutions in foreign lending and promoting project management to become international , to become scientific , and to become transparent .
In short , we will actively utilize every type of financing method with international benefits , reduce costs of our overall financing and reduce our financial risks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</ENAMEX> , we will confirm the qualifications of overseas issuance bodies , completing the transition process from " window management " to credit assessment management of debt issuance bodies , and establish a scientific , transparent system of credit assessment management .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xiaoling Wu</ENAMEX> also revealed that up to now , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's domestic institutions have cumulatively issued <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> dollar equivalent foreign currency debts of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 17 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> on the international capital market , forcefully supporting the rapid , continuous and healthy development of the country 's economy .
According to presentations , it has been <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</ENAMEX> now since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> issued overseas debt .
Reviewing the development over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these 15 years</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's domestic institutions issuing overseas debt , it has fundamentally been successful , from the nation 's macro management to the micro operation of every loan transaction .
