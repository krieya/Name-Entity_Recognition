We 're going to take `` a closer look '' at the man who will be inaugurated <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> .
He won the election .
He has a clear and powerful mandate for change .
He will be the President of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincente Fox .</ENAMEX>
This is an enormous event for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> which has been ruled for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven decades</ENAMEX> by the same party .
It 's a very important new chapter for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mexican</ENAMEX> - American relations , because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX> is promising revolutionary change .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Donaldson</ENAMEX> has recently been to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> to see him .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">58 - year - old</ENAMEX> man who becomes President of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> , strikingly handsome , wily in the ways of modern politics , enormously appealing as a symbol of change , has big plans .
I dream about so many things that we can do , eradicating poverty , eradicating crime , violence , corruption .
I believe in people .
I believe in the fact that people can change themselves .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mexicans</ENAMEX> were voting for change on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">election Day</ENAMEX> , no doubt about it , but it is also clear <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mexicans</ENAMEX> were voting for a man who has charmed and fascinated them , who has become their political Messiah .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX> comes from a farming and ranching family .
His grandfather was an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Irishman</ENAMEX> , but as a young man , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX> left the fields to work for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Coca - Cola company</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX> .
I started as a route salesman working for the company .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Ten years later</ENAMEX> , I was the president of the company .
How do you get to be president of a company in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</ENAMEX> when you start at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 22</ENAMEX> ?
Working hard , working hard , man .
But it will clearly take much more than hard work to make changes that will affect not only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> .
He says he will drive out the drug traffickers .
He promised to reduce poverty , which could mean an open border with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> since fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mexicans</ENAMEX> would want to cross over for jobs .
He 's even promised to stamp out corruption .
Corruption is the evil of all evils .
When you were campaigning , you called the opposition , the PRI , `` blood suckers , '' `` black adders , '' `` leaches . ''
Do you mean that ?
I am inviting them to govern with them together .
But why should they help you ?
You beat them .
You destroyed their power base .
Well , I 'm sure in their heart they still love <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> .
Many people here believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX> is naive .
The danger is probably he can not deliver the promises that he made during the campaign .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Javier Trevino</ENAMEX> was the campaign manager for the ruling party candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX> beat .
If these frustrations occur , what do you think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincente Fox</ENAMEX> will do ?
Nobody knows , exactly , because nobody knows <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincente Fox</ENAMEX> as President .
Many of them say to me , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX> is naive .
He 's not going to be able to do it , and he may go off half - cocked . ''
Well , those who have not been able to do things for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">71 years</ENAMEX> are not the best advice I can get .
I know we <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mexicans</ENAMEX> can .
Optimistic and ha charging , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX> takes office <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> acting like a man who , indeed , believes he can defy the odds and make his dreams for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> come true .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Donaldson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC News</ENAMEX> , on horseback in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> .
