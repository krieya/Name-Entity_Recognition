<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> did not fall asleep till <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">1100</ENAMEX> .
He looked sleepy on the train , but he did n't sleep .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> gave Mom a very clever retort .
On the train Mom noticed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> farting and asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> whether he +wanted to poo .
She also said to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> : " I gave birth to you , how could I not know what you are thinking about ? "
In <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</ENAMEX> when washing his feet at home , Mom said : " Let 's sell our house , buy a house next to Grandma 's , and give Dad the remaining money to start a business with , is that okay ? "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> did not say a word and stared at Dad .
Dad shook his head .
Mom asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> : " Why are you staring at Dad ? "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> replied : " Do n't you know what I am thinking about ?
Why do you still ask me ? "
In <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</ENAMEX> Dad woke him up .
Soaked crackers for breakfast .
Dad fed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> .
Getting ready to go to the kindergarten , Dad said , " Let Mom take you there . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> did not agree : " I want to go with Dad . "
Dad said : " Is it because Dad 's vehicle has a canopy ? "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> did n't say anything .
Dad helped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> put on his gloves and took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> to the kindergarten .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> wanted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX> to tell the teacher : " I lost a tooth and can not eat properly . "
He just did n't want to say it himself .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX> told the teacher , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> also opened his mouth for the teacher to look at it .
He looked very funny .
Then he pulled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX> over to look at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> 's drawer .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX> helped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> clean it up .
There is some other child 's stuff in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> 's drawer .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> took it out and put it back into the child 's drawer .
When moving the chair , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> pushed it : Some children in our class move chairs just like that .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX> wanted to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> did not want it .
He wanted to move it by himself .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX> came back in the evening , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> was running around holding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mom</ENAMEX> 's cell phone , talking to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle</ENAMEX> over the phone .
He promised <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> that from now on he would take <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle</ENAMEX> 's call .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> was calling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle</ENAMEX> " stupid , " just like he called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX> .
After finishing the call , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> showed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX> the math book he got from the auction and told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX> : " I know how to do math . "
He also said : " <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mom</ENAMEX> and I went to pop the rice ovalettes .
The rice ovalettes were still moist , so they did n't get fully popped . "
He then play the keyboard by himself , turning down the volume so as not to disturb the old grandma next door from her rest .
What a thoughtful kid !
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX> had had a bit too much to drink and did not talk much to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qingqing</ENAMEX> before he fell asleep .
