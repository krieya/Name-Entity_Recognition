Although his team lost <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the World Series</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">San Francisco Giants</ENAMEX> owner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Lurie</ENAMEX> hopes to have a new home for them .
He is an avid fan of a proposition on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week 's</ENAMEX> ballot to help build a replacement for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Candlestick Park</ENAMEX> .
Small wonder , since he 's asking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> taxpayers to sink up to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</ENAMEX> into the new stadium .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> digs out from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">The Pretty Big One</ENAMEX> , opponents say the last thing the city can afford is an expensive new stadium .
A stadium craze is sweeping the country .
It 's fueled by the increasing profitability of major - league teams .
Something like <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one - third</ENAMEX> of the nation 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</ENAMEX> largest cities are thinking about new stadiums , ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Petersburg</ENAMEX> .
Most boosters claim the new sports complexes will be moneymakers for their city .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pepperdine University</ENAMEX> economist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Baim</ENAMEX> scoffs at that .
He has looked at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</ENAMEX> baseball and football stadiums and found that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</ENAMEX> -- private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dodger Stadium</ENAMEX> -- brought more money into a city than it took out .
Stadiums tend to redistribute existing wealth within a community , not create more of it .
Voters generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega-stadium .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> voters rejected a new ballpark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phoenix</ENAMEX> voters turned thumbs down on a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</ENAMEX> stadium bond and tax proposition .
Its backers fielded every important interest on their team -- a popular mayor , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> , the major media -- and spent $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">100,000</ENAMEX> on promotion .
But voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself , and rejected it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41 %</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , its backers concede the ballpark is at best running even in the polls .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Christopher</ENAMEX> , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> mayor who built <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Candlestick Park</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Giants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</ENAMEX> , wo n't endorse the new ballpark .
He says he had <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Candlestick</ENAMEX> built because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Giants</ENAMEX> claimed they needed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</ENAMEX> parking spaces .
Since the new park will have <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1,500</ENAMEX> spaces , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher</ENAMEX> thinks backers are playing some fiscal `` games '' of their own with the voters .
Stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Miami Dolphins</ENAMEX> owner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Robbie</ENAMEX> disagrees , and he can prove it .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Several years ago</ENAMEX> he gave up trying to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> to improve its city - owned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Orange Bowl</ENAMEX> , and instead built his own <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</ENAMEX> coliseum with private funds .
He did n't see why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit .
`` This stadium shows that anything government can do , we can do better , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robbie</ENAMEX> says .
But to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon Landrieu</ENAMEX> , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> mayor who helped build that city 's cavernous , money - losing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Superdome</ENAMEX> , questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Superdome</ENAMEX> is an exercise in optimism , a statement of faith , '' he has said .
`` It is the very building of it that is important , not how much of it is used or its economics . ''
An <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptian</ENAMEX> Pharaoh could n't have justified his pyramids any better .
But civilization has moved forward since then .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> taxpayers get to vote , most of the time , on whether they want to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs , or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions .
