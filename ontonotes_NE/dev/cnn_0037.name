Experts say there 's no accurate or useful way to profile the personality of a child that might commit violent acts .
That 's according to a new study from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Secret Service</ENAMEX> on school violence .
It shows that attackers , like the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> who killed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</ENAMEX> people at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbine High School</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> , come from a variety of family and ethnic backgrounds .
Academic performance ranged from excellent to failure .
Some -- so far only boys , were considered loners , others popular .
Behavioral problems were common among some children , but others had no such history .
Experts say the study 's information is still useful .
It 's really a fact - based report , and with these facts , a school can move out and actually do prevention , and some of that prevention is to realize that there are boys out there who are in pain who will just mention it slightly because they are afraid to talk about it , and the school can do something about that .
They can respond in a supportive shame - free way and help that boy out before he moves on to targeted violence , instead of saying , Boys will be boys or all boys say these things , so let 's just forget about it .
The study also found <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</ENAMEX> the students who perpetrated attacks were motivated by revenge and had a history of gun use .
