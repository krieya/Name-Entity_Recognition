<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's Inc.</ENAMEX> , the world 's biggest auction house , is taking a huge Wall Street - style risk on the outcome of the sale of art from the estate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John T. Dorrance Jr.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campbell Soup Co.</ENAMEX> heir .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Financial Services</ENAMEX> division has guaranteed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> family that it will receive a minimum of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</ENAMEX> for the collection , regardless of what the bids for the art works total , people close to the transaction say .
The collection , which includes <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> early <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Picassos</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a van Gogh</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monet</ENAMEX> , other paintings , furniture and porcelains , went on sale last night in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> auctions .
What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> is doing closely resembles an underwriting by an investment bank .
A corporation that wants to sell stock or bonds goes to a Wall Street firm , which purchases the securities outright , accepting the financial risk of finding buyers .
If the investment bank can sell the securities at a higher price than it paid the issuer , it makes a profit .
At the initial sale last night , for example -- the sale featuring the Impressionists masters -- bids totaled <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 116 million</ENAMEX> .
That was slightly above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> presale estimate of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 111 million</ENAMEX> .
Normally , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> would have earned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</ENAMEX> of the total in commissions .
Instead , people familiar with the transaction said , the auction house opted to forgo that percentage in order to obtain the collection and in exchange for taking a bigger chunk of proceeds exceeding <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</ENAMEX> .
Art dealers say that while auction houses occasionally guarantee the seller of a highly desirable work of art a minimum price , a financial commitment of this size is unprecedented .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana D. Brooks</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's North America</ENAMEX> division , vehemently denies it offered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> heirs a money - back guarantee , calling such reports `` inaccurate . ''
Buried in the glossy hardbound catalog for the sale , however , appears the statement , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> has an interest in the property in this catalog . ''
Explains a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby</ENAMEX> 's spokeswoman , the statement `` means exactly what it says .
We have some level of financial interest '' in the collection .
`` We do n't disclose specifics . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Mirabello</ENAMEX> , a lawyer for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> estate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> law firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Morgan , Lewis -AMP- Bockius</ENAMEX> , declines to comment on the financial arrangements .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> made the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</ENAMEX> guarantee to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> collection away from its archrival , auction house <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christie 's International PLC</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christie 's</ENAMEX> has handled smaller sales for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> family over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</ENAMEX> .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christie 's</ENAMEX> officials asked why the firm was n't picked to sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> collection , representatives of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> family `` told us it was a question of financial considerations , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Findlay</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christie 's</ENAMEX> head of impressionist and modern paintings .
Collectors who have made their money on Wall Street have become an increasingly important part of the art business and their money has helped fuel the art boom , but recently it appears <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> has been returning the compliment .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1987</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> essentially offered a Wall Street - style `` bridge loan '' of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 27 million</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Australian</ENAMEX> businessman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Bond</ENAMEX> to enable him to purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent van Gogh 's</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Irises</ENAMEX> '' for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 53.9 million</ENAMEX> .
It was the highest bid in history for a work of art .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> said that it has the painting under lock and key because the loan had not been fully repaid .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> is offering such deals because it 's an art sellers ' market , at least where the best works are concerned , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Lerner</ENAMEX> , an attorney and author of the book `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Art Law</ENAMEX> . ''
`` There seems to be a lot of art for sale , but there 's more competition .
The competition gives the seller the ability to cut a better deal , '' he says .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> family will still receive a substantial portion of the auction proceeds <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">above $ 100 million</ENAMEX> , people familiar with the transaction said .
But it 's likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> will take a higher than usual commission , called an override , on the amount exceeding the guarantee .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> has been aggressively promoting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> sale .
At a news conference <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last May</ENAMEX> announcing plans for the auction , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> estimated its value in excess of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</ENAMEX> .
More recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> has predicted the collection will fetch <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 140 million</ENAMEX> .
That 's the highest estimate for a single collection in auction history .
The decision to put the entire collection on the block stunned many , since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> had served as chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Philadelphia Museum of Art</ENAMEX> , and it had been assumed many of the works would be donated to the institution .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night 's</ENAMEX> sale , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</ENAMEX> works that sold were purchased by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Aska International Gallery</ENAMEX> , the art - acquisition unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Aichi Financial</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> conglomerate that owns <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.5 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christie 's</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> guarantee is raising eyebrows in the art world .
`` The consumer has to throw out the idea that the auction house is a disinterested middleman , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> art dealer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Tunick</ENAMEX> .
While he adds that he has no problem with auction houses who sell works in which they have a financial interest , `` It ought not to be hidden in some small print . ''
In such situations , he says , the house `` is going to put the best light on things . ''
For example , an auction house 's comments on the condition of a work of art that is up for sale should be looked at with `` very open eyes , '' he says .
`` There 's more and more of this cash - up - front going on at every level , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Miller</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Art Funding Corp.</ENAMEX> , an art lender .
Dealers and auction houses `` know if they do n't lay out <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half a million</ENAMEX> for this , another one will ; it 's that competitive . ''
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> galleries , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Coe Kerr Gallery</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Beadleston Fine Arts</ENAMEX> , snatched a major art collection owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Askin</ENAMEX> family away from rival auction - house bidders with an up - front payment of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 25 million</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christie</ENAMEX> 's spokeswoman said that while the auction house sometimes waives its seller 's commission to attract art works -- it still gets a commission from the buyer -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christie 's</ENAMEX> wo n't offer financial guarantees because `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christie 's</ENAMEX> believes its primary role is as an auction house , and therefore as an agent -LCB- for buyer and seller -RCB- , not as a bank .
