The federal government suspended sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> savings bonds because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> has n't lifted the ceiling on government debt .
Until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> acts , the government has n't any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> said .
The government 's borrowing authority dropped at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.80 trillion</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.87 trillion</ENAMEX> .
Legislation to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled in the fight over cutting capital - gains taxes .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> has voted to raise the ceiling to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.1 trillion</ENAMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> is n't expected to act until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> at the earliest .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> will default on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 9</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> does n't act by then .
