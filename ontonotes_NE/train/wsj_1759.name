<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Helmsley Enterprises Inc.</ENAMEX> plans to close its company - owned insurance business and is seeking other brokers to take over its policies , according to individuals familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> firm .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Helmsley Enterprises</ENAMEX> is the umbrella organization for companies controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry B. Helmsley</ENAMEX> .
These include office and residential real estate giant , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">HelmsleySpear Inc.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Helmsley Hotels</ENAMEX> .
The insurance brokerage agency , just a fragment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Helmsley</ENAMEX> 's vast empire , would be the first piece of the company to be stripped away since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</ENAMEX> when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmsley</ENAMEX> 's wife , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leona Helmsley</ENAMEX> , was found guilty of tax evasion .
Industry sources estimate the agency brokers property and casualty premiums worth <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 25 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</ENAMEX> , and has revenue , based on a standard <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> commission rate , of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2.5 million</ENAMEX> .
The insurance firm acts as a broker on policies covering buildings managed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">HelmsleySpear</ENAMEX> and others .
Many of the properties are owned through limited partnerships controlled by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmsley</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York State</ENAMEX> law prohibits insurance brokerages from deriving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 %</ENAMEX> of revenue from insuring affiliated companies .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Helmsley</ENAMEX> 's insurance division had slightly exceeded that percentage , sources say , but the division was n't considered significant enough to the company to be restructured , particularly at a difficult time for the firm .
Adverse publicity from the scandal surrounding its founder 's wife and related management strife have put pressure on the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Helmsley</ENAMEX> organization .
However , individuals close to the company insist shuttering the insurance division , a sideline from the company 's core property management business , is n't the beginning of a sale of assets .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Helmsley</ENAMEX> 's insurance premiums are expected to be transferred to several different insurance brokerage companies .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Frank B. Hall Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Briarcliff Manor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> is reportedly working out an agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Helmsley</ENAMEX> .
Officials there declined to comment , as did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Helmsley</ENAMEX> management .
