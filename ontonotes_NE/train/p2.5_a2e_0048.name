In spite of the depressing scene engulfing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> world with its wars and crises , the balance of terror and the fear of escalating wars and crises may motivate those concerned into trying to find a way out of them , after each side has become aware of the dangers of escalation and the impasses ahead .
The past <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</ENAMEX> have seen the greatest degree of military escalation and political aggravation in all the crises in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Middle East</ENAMEX> , and neither escalation nor aggravation has helped achieve the specific agendas of any side that has worked to provoke or inflame these crises .
Without a doubt , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> administration is primarily responsible for igniting new crises or failing to put out old ones in the region .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Six years</ENAMEX> have passed during which first <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon</ENAMEX> then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olmert</ENAMEX> , and with great support from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's administration , used the highest degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> violence against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> people yet could not subjugate the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> or put an end to their resistance .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> military apparatus also conducted an all - out offensive war on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> , with the open support of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's administration , and did not succeed in achieving its goals in spite of the widespread destruction it created .
As for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , it has seen and continues to see the greatest degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> military embroilment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Middle East</ENAMEX> for the first time in the history of the region , which will have a profound effect on the fate of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> interests and the future of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab - American</ENAMEX> relations .
And many political and security crises will replicate from the womb of these wars in the lands of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , the most obvious of which is now the risk of sectarian , ideological and ethnic conflicts , in addition to conflicts relating to politics and the competition for power and authority , and at times even for opposition .
