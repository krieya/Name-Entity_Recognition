Hey , folks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Al - Qasim</ENAMEX> , is the news I heard true ?
Honestly , I did not believe it .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nasri</ENAMEX>
I was talking to a young man from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">al - Qasim</ENAMEX> this afternoon on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Messenger</ENAMEX> ,
and he gave me this news that hit me like a bolt of lightening .
He said : there is a women 's coffee shop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barida</ENAMEX> , and he gave me its name - " <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jothun</ENAMEX> " .
What 's going on , folks ?
A women 's coffee shop , and where ! In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barida</ENAMEX> !
Anyways , I did not believe it .
I sat down in the evening to read a book , but I could n't .
" A women 's coffee shop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barida</ENAMEX> " just locked into my mind .
as if I could feel the sights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Barida</ENAMEX> people on that coffee shop -LRB- with a disco -RRB- I sat imagining that coffee shop .
As soon as you think of that coffee shop , the modern means of doing something sinful comes to your mind -LRB- text messages -RRB- , sealed with the words -LRB- sin and spread it -RRB- .
I sat imagining that coffee shop in its place
I imagined the organization surrounding it ,
I imagined the bearded ones speaking about women who came to sip cappuccinos ,
Drinking that coffee is forbidden by its very name , as everything that is unknown is forbidden .
You will not find " mocca " you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Al - Rasini</ENAMEX> blend .
By God , please , -LRB- a male reciter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Koran</ENAMEX> who blends coffee -RRB- , I mean , a male coffee blend .
What will they offer there ?
Will it be the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Qasimi</ENAMEX> kalija fresh from the bakery to the table ?
Will fatit take the place of gateau and tiramisu ?
We will not find croissants , to be replaced by the same letter -LRB- " carath " -LSB- = leek -RSB- and hot bread -RRB- ,
Will a bunch of be-socked and be-gloved ladies storm that place to report back to their husbands what is happening there ?
Will they volunteer to spread revivalist consciousness among the women -LRB- take your copy -RRB- made up of a bag containing books of horror stories + gloves + socks + <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Virtues of Staying Home tape</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the tape on Forbidden Acts in Shopping Malls</ENAMEX> ,
And so you will not smell the scent of perfume there , perhaps the fragrance of agarwood and frankincense , and maybe henna , the make - up of the women from the revivalist movement
and given the hallucinations of the revivalist women about the Evil Eye , there is no objection to a young girl doing the rounds with a cup into which all present will spit because a girl who visited the place yesterday evening had developed a headache and minds veered towards the illness of the revivalist women -LRB- the Evil Eye -RRB-
Aaaaahhh , how I wish to be standing now in that place
If you were saved from the lion do n't start wishing to hunt it Mona Lisa
Praise be to God
..
This is a good deed from amongst my good deeds on the forum , that I made such creatures get out of here and shut the door behind them
do not forget this service of mine and do n't be afraid
I have forgiven you with a penalty clause
Thanks
Do not stare at the sun to find out its secrets , you might become blind

It seems my transmitted reply angered you more , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nasri</ENAMEX> , because I can see you .. have responded twice , I do not know whether out of hallucinating or the foolish talk from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> .
The blame is on the poster and it might have been a female , I mean , not a male .
Anyways , it does not bother me whether you get your head angry or content , as it is nearer to it all .
I liked the reply of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">No. 69</ENAMEX> , I asked it in the eighties and especially as the question was about you moving from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> predicament to a lesser one .
We are waiting for the answer from you , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cafe Al - Rasini</ENAMEX>
Women are of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> kinds : <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> who makes a home for the man and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> that makes a man for the home , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> is greater .

If you were saved from the lion do n't start wishing to hunt it

A word to the moderators ... Do n't the people of this country , who have been badmouthed by this deviant , deserve respect from you ?
Do n't the members who belong to it deserve respect from you ?
Are n't the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> principles and religious precepts which this relapsed person has made fun of value to you ?
Moderators , you have disciplined , limited and deleted postings lighter than these ...
This member provokes the members , posters and readers with his postings and replies , and defames this forum at other forums ..
This sick person has exploited the free space made available to him to abuse religion , principles and members .
For this reason , it is a negative freedom that does n't work with this sick person .
Freedom is for those who research , debates and proposes serious matters about which he exchanges opinion and thoughts with others in respectful way .
But to badmouth a broad cross - section of the community and make fun of those posting under the pretext of " satirical criticism " , is acceptable neither to yourselves nor to your nations ..
God knows what the intentions are .

Brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mim</ENAMEX> .. This sick person is looking for notoriety
He presents the liberals ' annoying and distressing subjects , then searches in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Google</ENAMEX> to see who copied a subject and who spoke about it ...
The most important thing for him is to become famous ... even at the expense of his honor , if he has any
.. otherwise , what normal , reasonable person gets abused and insulted in a forum , then directs others to that forum , and links to where he was insulted to prove his notoriety !!
I hope the moderators will take serious action against this sick person ..
Because normal people have been stopped ...
and what about this mental ?

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mim</ENAMEX>
Brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ready for the Forum</ENAMEX> Thank you for the brief introduction to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nasri</ENAMEX>
But I still insist on hearing the answer from him directly , my question is still open .
I repeat and I say it again ... If you want it to the private mail , I have no objection .
Only God brings success , no one else .

Our sister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hissa Machiavelli</ENAMEX> It seems that your aspirations are in conflict with your desires just as the first part of your handle cancels its last out .
The disadvantaged wishes and the strong acts , and you have disadvantaged yourself to satisfy others .
However , your contradictory handle has enabled me to invent myself a contradictory handle and call it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The Unfaithful Divorcee</ENAMEX> .
It is shameful to decide that our desires are the correct act , and that they are the ideal for life .
Perhaps this is as a result of a concealed pride , but why do you judge the acts of others as sick and yours as perfect ?
The same rationale that allows you to judge the acts of others has allowed us to judge you !!
My brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Misu</ENAMEX> It seems that your insults are of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> kinds : <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> encoded and the other decoded .
If only you would encode all your replies !
If you were saved from the lion do n't start wishing to hunt it
