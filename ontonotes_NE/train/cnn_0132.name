Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Boxer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> to support the undervote recount .
She says on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Election Day</ENAMEX> , exit polls in the state indicated voters chose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> , and now it 's time to see if that 's true , but not everyone appreciated what she had to say .
I have something I want to say to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> people , and that is , if they were up here speaking , I would not boo them , and I also wanted to mention to them that I come from the state that elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> , who they revere , and also those same people elected me , so I hope that they would have the decency to allow me to speak .
