Why do humans want to raise offspring ,
Some say this is human nature ,
This is voiced from the perspective of natural human instinct .
Yet from the perspective of human socialization , people in different historical periods saw things differently ,
For example , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's period of feudalist society , it was called " raising children to provide for old age , "
But when the retirement system in a society has gradually been established , this opinion no longer holds ,
Have n't some young people chosen so - called DINK families ?
Have n't some people chosen to be what they call single aristocrats ?
And on and on .
Raising a child is a great hassle ,
A mother has to go through various kinds of pregnancy - related discomfort during pregnancy ,
During delivery , it takes a lot of time and energy if it is a natural birth ,
Sometimes she might suffer a cut on her belly .
What are they doing this for .
Of course , according to the opinion of mainstream economists , these women can only be great fools .
