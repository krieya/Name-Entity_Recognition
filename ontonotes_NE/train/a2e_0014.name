Today on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mesopotamia</ENAMEX> channel they brought the photo of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> in the coffin before burial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The coast of Jeddah</ENAMEX>
The photo of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> minutes before the burial was clear .
It was as we know him , except that his face was whiter than it was during the trial ...
The person who lifted the cover off his face kissed him -LRB- may God have mercy on him -RRB- .
My regards .
No matter how much we may disagree civility remains between us .

Thank you , brother .

The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiites</ENAMEX> are the people of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> ..
Yes , but it is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG" S_OFF="1">the -LRB- White -RRB- House</ENAMEX> ..
May every <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Bairam</ENAMEX> come and your scandals be abundant , if God wills .

Concern destroys the stout with wasting away *** and it makes white the forelock of the lad and makes him decrepit .
-LRB- In this user he writes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I am the Arab</ENAMEX> , free pen , and other men and women -RRB-

His affair is with God who is the wisest of judges .
Are we responsible for whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> is among the people of Heaven or Hell ??
Why are we not preoccupied with ourselves and present for them before death befalls us and we are unaware of what awaits us afterwards !!?
What should be mentioned are the good deeds of our deceased <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> only .
We should not utter the profession of faith for anyone who we felt friendly towards or who we sympathized with .
Let us not forget the uncle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prophet</ENAMEX> -LRB- may God bless him and grant him salvation -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Talib</ENAMEX> , and his death in unbelief .
The Prophet eagerly desired that his final deed would be to say " there is no God but Allah , " but Almighty God guides whoever He wishes .
Oh God , we ask you for a good end .
Death suffices for a preacher .

God is glorious .
Emotion is still the thing that moves us away from the facts of the religion by necessity ..
We are not saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> is among the martyrs who are worthy of honors .. and we are not saying that he has not been pardoned ..
Who is it that makes oaths about God !
But the man has attained what he reached ..
It is nonsense to occupy this place by narrating honors and projecting heroism for a mere emotional situation imposed by the circumstances of his execution .
It is bigger and more serious than this ..
I do not belittle the circumstances and the meaning of the event , and I do not forbid you or myself from discussing it ..
But : we have to seek the ruling of the requirements of faith and refer things to God and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">His Prophet</ENAMEX> in every incident and situation so our positions are as well - established as our established facts ..
May God bless you .
God suffices for us and He is the best <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> to trust .

Where is the emotion , brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wabil</ENAMEX> ?
And you , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jawa</ENAMEX> ?
You are bringing this speech from where ?
Who said that he is among the people of Heaven or among the people of Hell ?
Really , just eloquence , and join the people , blonde .
My Regards .
