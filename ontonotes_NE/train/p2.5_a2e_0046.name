<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Dhari</ENAMEX> , the secretary - general of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslim</ENAMEX> Scholars League , and the President of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Green Zone Republic</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Talabani</ENAMEX> accused <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheikh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harith</ENAMEX> of being interested only in igniting nationalist -LRB- i.e. , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kurdish</ENAMEX> -RRB- and sectarian -LRB- i.e. , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunni</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiite</ENAMEX> , of course -RRB- feuds .
For such an accusation to come from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Green Zone</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheikh Harith</ENAMEX> is no strange matter , but for it to come from the President of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republic of Iraq</ENAMEX> - this is indeed strange and objectionable .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talabani</ENAMEX> came to prominence at the head of a group of youths who split from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullah Mustafa Barzani</ENAMEX> , he has been part of all the unrest that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kurds</ENAMEX> have been subject to .
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Baath</ENAMEX> government in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> , from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> , from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talabani</ENAMEX> has not left any party with interests or concerns in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and its affairs without working with them , on one level or another .
Up to the time that his statement was released , he was working to create a rift among the ranks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kurdish</ENAMEX> movement and disputes between them , implicating the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kurds</ENAMEX> in a series of failed armed skirmishes against the central government -LRB- some of which did not fail to serve the interests of foreign forces -RRB- , in starting a destructive <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kurdish</ENAMEX> civil war in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the nineties</ENAMEX> , then getting involved in the plan to invade and occupy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , which has brought the country to the state of hell , destruction and death it finds itself in .
