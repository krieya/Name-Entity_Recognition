Stock - market tremors again shook bond prices , while the dollar turned in a mixed performance .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Early yesterday</ENAMEX> , investors scrambled to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds for safety as stock prices plummeted and fears mounted of a replay of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
But stocks later recovered , erasing most of their early declines .
That cut short the rally in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds and depressed prices moderately below <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Monday 's</ENAMEX> levels .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average , down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 60.25</ENAMEX> points <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early in the day</ENAMEX> , finished <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.65</ENAMEX> points lower at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2638.73</ENAMEX> .
Long - term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> issues declined <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</ENAMEX> a point , or $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5</ENAMEX> for each $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> face amount .
`` The stock market clearly is leading the bond markets , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Conlon</ENAMEX> , an executive vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nikko Securities</ENAMEX> .
`` People are breathing a major sigh of relief that the world did n't end <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> '' or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
Gold , a closely watched barometer of investor anxiety , was little changed .
The dollar initially fell against other major currencies on news that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade deficit surged in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.77 billion</ENAMEX> .
But the dollar later rebounded , finishing slightly higher against the yen although slightly lower against the mark .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> officials sent another signal of their determination to shore up investor confidence .
In an apparent attempt to keep a lid on short - term interest rates , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> once again pumped money into the banking system .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> move was a small gesture , traders said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> officials appear reluctant to ease their credit grip any further because a bold move does n't appear necessary , several investment managers said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> has allowed a key short - term interest rate to decline <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one - quarter</ENAMEX> percentage point .
The federal funds rate on <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</ENAMEX> loans between banks has been hovering <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 8 3/4 %</ENAMEX> , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> previously .
Although stocks have led bonds <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> , some traders predict that relationship will reverse during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few weeks</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nikko</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conlon</ENAMEX> fears a huge wave of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> borrowing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early next month</ENAMEX> will drive down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bond prices .
That , coupled with poor <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">third - quarter</ENAMEX> corporate - earnings comparisons , `` will make trouble for the equity market for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next two to three months</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
But several other traders contend investors have overreacted to junk - bond jitters , and that stock prices will continue to recover .
`` They shot the whole orchestra just because the piano player hit a bad note , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laszlo Birinyi</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Birinyi Associates Inc.</ENAMEX> , referring to the stock market 's plunge <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> on news of trouble in financing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL Corp .</ENAMEX> buy - out .
In major market activity : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bond prices fell .
The yield on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds climbed back above <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> , ending <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.03 %</ENAMEX> .
The dollar was mixed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Late yesterday</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , the dollar rose to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.75 yen</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.80 yen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> , but fell to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8667 marks</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8685 marks</ENAMEX> .
