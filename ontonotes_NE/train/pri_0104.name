Lawyers for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Libyans</ENAMEX> charged with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> airliner bombing say they will call no further witnesses , abruptly ending testimony in the trial .
They closed their case after failing to obtain what they say is crucial evidence from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Castle</ENAMEX> reports .
In an unexpected turn of events , defense lawyers told the trial judges that after calling <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> witnesses , no further evidence will be led on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the accused <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Libyans</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul Basit Ali Mohammad Almed Grahi</ENAMEX> and none at all introduced for the other , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alamin Khaleefa Fima</ENAMEX> .
As a result , neither of the accused will take the stand to give evidence .
The development follows the refusal by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> to cooperate with efforts by the court to recover information regarded by defense lawyers as crucial to their case , that the bombing was carried out by militant <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> , some of whom were members of an organization with links to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> .
