I had a very lonely childhood because I was the only child in the family , and most of my playmates in the neighborhood had moved to the cities .
Life , like that small river in front of my home , flowed quietly without the slightest ripple .
I often stayed on the riverbank by myself , watching the boats pass by .
They were all very small fishing boats , and under each canopy was a household .
I did not know where they came from or where they were going .
It seemed that I never saw the same boat pass by twice .
My mother sometimes asked : " <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huazi</ENAMEX> , why do you go to the riverbank ? "
I said : " To watch the boats . "
I could not see either end of the river .
I started to think that this world must be very large , but that it does not belong to me .
I just stood on the riverbank watching .
The year when I was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> , we also moved to live on a street in the center of a small town .
Uncle <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baocheng</ENAMEX> still lived a lone life by the river by himself .
I would still go visit him .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year 's Day</ENAMEX> and other holidays , my parents would invite him over for meals .
In a flash , I was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve</ENAMEX> and attending a local middle school that had a bad reputation .
Actually I graduated from elementary school with very good grades , but because my parents were not well connected , I was rejected by the best one , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">No. 1</ENAMEX> Middle School .
I was somewhat despondent .
After they received the notice , my parents were very down .
I went out by myself and kept walking until dark .
I found I had come to the riverbank , and thought I might go and drop a visit to Uncle <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baocheng</ENAMEX> .
