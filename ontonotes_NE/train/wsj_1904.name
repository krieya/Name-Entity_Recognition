<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Monopolies and Mergers Commission</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> cleared <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rhone - Poulenc S.A. 's</ENAMEX> purchase of a specialty bulk - chemical unit from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Monsanto Co.</ENAMEX> , saying the purchase was unlikely to have any lasting impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> industrial consumers .
The commission , which was asked to study the deal by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Department of Trade and Industry</ENAMEX> after its announcement in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February</ENAMEX> , said the diversity of global supply of chemicals used in making analgesic drugs was great enough to offset the dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> market share <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rhone - Poulenc</ENAMEX> would gain through the acquisition .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> chemical giant would hold an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</ENAMEX> share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> market for salicylic acid , methyl salicylate and bulk aspirin .
The commission found that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> government attempted to block the merger , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rhone - Poulenc</ENAMEX> would likely respond by closing the salicylates plant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Monsanto</ENAMEX> operates in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wales</ENAMEX> , removing the matter from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> jurisdiction .
