<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform Inc.</ENAMEX> loves to be intimate with its customers , but not with the rest of the public .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">67 - year - old</ENAMEX> maker of brassieres , panties , and lingerie enjoys one of the best - known brand images , but its financial profile is closely guarded by members of the founding family .
`` There are very few companies that can boast of such a close - knit group , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert A. Brawer</ENAMEX> , 52 years old , recently named president , succeeding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beatrice Coleman</ENAMEX> , his mother - in - law , who remains chairman .
`` We are a vanishing breed , '' he muses .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs. Coleman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">73</ENAMEX> , who declined to be interviewed , is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> strategist .
Sales have tripled during her <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">21 - year</ENAMEX> tenure to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 200 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> says it is very profitable but declines to provide specifics .
The company sells image .
Its current ad campaign , on which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> has spent <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 15 million</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fall 1987</ENAMEX> , does n't even show its underwear products , but rather men like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Reeve</ENAMEX> , star of the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Superman</ENAMEX> '' movies , talking about their lingerie turn - ons .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> name `` is part of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> pop culture , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Sinopoli</ENAMEX> , account supervisor of the campaign by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Levine , Huntley , Schmidt -AMP- Beaver</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> ad firm .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> generated such memorable campaigns as `` I dreamed I ... in my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> bra , '' and `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> woman .
You never know where she 'll turn up . ''
`` Capitalizing on the brand is key , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX> , whose immediate plans include further international expansion and getting better control of distribution outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
`` The intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> -RCB- is a force to be reckoned with , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David S. Leibowitz</ENAMEX> , a special situations analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
Although working women are `` forced to wear the uniform of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> , to retain their femininity they are buying better quality , more upscale intimate apparel , '' he said .
Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX> 's appointment as president was long expected , the move on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 25</ENAMEX> precipitated the resignation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Lesk</ENAMEX> as senior vice president of sales and merchandising .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Three days later</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesk</ENAMEX> was named president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Olga Co.</ENAMEX> , a competing intimate apparel division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warnaco Inc</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warnaco</ENAMEX> also owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warners</ENAMEX> , another major intimate apparel maker .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesk</ENAMEX> could n't be reached to comment .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> officials say that after spending <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">24 years</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesk</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">48</ENAMEX> , made it clear he wanted the top job .
`` If you want the presidency of the company , this is n't the firm to work for , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Mogan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">45</ENAMEX> , who was named senior vice president of sales , assuming some of the responsibilities of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesk</ENAMEX> .
The company downplayed the loss of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesk</ENAMEX> and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> people .
`` My style is less informal , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX> says .
Top officers insist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> 's greatest strength is its family ownership .
`` You ca n't go anywhere in this company and find an organizational chart , '' one delights .
`` It is fun competing as a private company , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX> says .
`` You can think long range . ''
Other major players in intimate apparel apparently feel the same way .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warnaco</ENAMEX> was taken private by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Spectrum Group</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 487 million</ENAMEX> .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Playtex Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX> went private for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 680 million</ENAMEX> .
It was then split into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Playtex Apparel Inc.</ENAMEX> , the intimate apparel division , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Playtex Family Products Corp.</ENAMEX> , which makes tampons , hair - care items and other products .
Publicly traded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VF Corp.</ENAMEX> , which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sara Lee Corp.</ENAMEX> , which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bali Co.</ENAMEX> , are also strong forces in intimate apparel .
Buy - out offers for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> are n't infrequent , says Executive Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David C. Masket</ENAMEX> , but they are n't taken very seriously .
When he gets calls , `` I do n't even have to consult '' with Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masket</ENAMEX> says .
The company could command a good price in the market .
`` Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three and a half years</ENAMEX> , apparel companies , many of whom have strong brand names , have been bought at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 60 %</ENAMEX> of sales , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah Bronston</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential - Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> apparel analyst .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX> , along with Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> and her daughter , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth</ENAMEX> , an attorney who is vice chairman , are the family members involved in the operations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> , which employs <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5,000</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX> 's wife , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Stroup</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth</ENAMEX> 's husband , round out the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> - member board .
Each has an equal vote at the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> meetings .
`` We are all very amiable , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX> says .
Executives say Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> is very involved in the day - to - <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> operations , especially product development .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1960s</ENAMEX> she designed a lightweight stretch bra that boosted sales .
Her father , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Rosenthal</ENAMEX> , designed the then - dress making company 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> bra in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</ENAMEX> , which he said gave women a `` maiden form '' compared with the `` boyish form '' they got from the `` flat bandages '' used for support at the time .
While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenthal</ENAMEX> introduced new undergarment designs , his wife , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ida</ENAMEX> , concentrated on sales and other financial matters .
The name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> was coined by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> business partner , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enid Bissett</ENAMEX> .
The company has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</ENAMEX> plants and distribution facilities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> , other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Caribbean</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> products are mainly sold at department stores , but the company has quietly opened a retail store of its own in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omaha</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neb.</ENAMEX> , and has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</ENAMEX> factory outlets , with plans to add more .
Before joining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX> , who holds a doctoral degree in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of Chicago</ENAMEX> , taught at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of Wisconsin</ENAMEX> .
As a senior vice president , he has headed the company 's designer lingerie division , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Oscar de la Renta</ENAMEX> , since its inception in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> .
To maintain exclusivity of that designer line , it is n't labeled with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> name .
While the company has always been family - run , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX> is n't the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> person to marry into the family and subsequently head <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maidenform</ENAMEX> .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> 's husband , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> , a physician , succeeded Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenthal</ENAMEX> as president and served in that post until his death in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</ENAMEX> .
