Of all the ethnic tensions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , which is the most troublesome right now ?
A good bet would be the tension between blacks and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jews</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> .
Or so it must seem to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Mason</ENAMEX> , the veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> comedian appearing in a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> sitcom airing on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</ENAMEX> -LRB- 9:30 - 10 <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">p.m. EDT</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Not only is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> the star of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chicken Soup</ENAMEX> , '' he 's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Duck Soup</ENAMEX> , '' and he 's currently a man in hot water .
Here , in neutral language , is the gist of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> 's remarks , quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Village Voice</ENAMEX> while he was a paid spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> mayoral campaign , and then in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Newsweek</ENAMEX> after he and the campaign parted company .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> said that many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates uncritically .
He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates uncritically .
He said that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jews</ENAMEX> have contributed more to black causes over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</ENAMEX> than vice versa .
Of course , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> did not use neutral language .
As a practitioner of ethnic humor from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the old days</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Borscht Belt</ENAMEX> , live television and the nightclub circuit , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> instinctively reached for the vernacular .
He said <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jews</ENAMEX> were `` sick with complexes '' ; and he called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> 's black opponent , `` a fancy shvartze with a mustache . ''
If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> , would the water be quite so hot ?
It probably would , because few or none of the people upset by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language .
In addition , some of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism .
For example , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> state counsel for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NAACP</ENAMEX> said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> is `` like a dinosaur .
People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . ''
These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group , such as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Polish</ENAMEX> jokes '' ; and the type that is double - edged , aiming inward as well as outward .
The latter typically is the humor of the underdog , and it was perfected by both blacks and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jews</ENAMEX> on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves .
In the hands of a zealot like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenny Bruce</ENAMEX> , this double - edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons .
But wielded by a pro like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Mason</ENAMEX> , it is a constructive form of mischief .
Why constructive ?
Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict .
That 's why it 's dangerous to have well - intentioned thought police , on college campuses and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Kristol</ENAMEX> wrote in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Times</ENAMEX> just before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> donnybrook , `` Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer . ''
The question is , if group conflicts still exist -LRB- as undeniably they do -RRB- , and if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ?
Do n't say the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy .
It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue - collar <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Bostonians</ENAMEX> in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cheers</ENAMEX> '' ; children vs. adults in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Cosby Show</ENAMEX> . ''
But these are not the differences that make headlines .
In `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chicken Soup</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> plays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> bachelor courting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maddie</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">-LRB- Lynn Redgrave -RRB-</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Irish</ENAMEX> widow and mother of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> , against the wishes of his mother -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rita Karin</ENAMEX> -RRB- and her brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brandon Maggart</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
It 's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants .
At least , they both speak with strong accents , as do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maddie</ENAMEX> .
It could n't be more obvious that `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chicken Soup</ENAMEX> '' is being made from an old recipe .
And a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">an Orthodox Jew</ENAMEX> and a member of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">the Nation of Islam</ENAMEX> .
Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</ENAMEX> , the play and movie versions of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Abie 's Irish Rose</ENAMEX> '' made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Irish</ENAMEX> immigrants so popular that its author , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Nichols</ENAMEX> , lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain .
And it has remained there , as evidenced by its reappearance in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> sitcom called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bridget Loves Bernie</ENAMEX> , '' whose sole distinction was that it led to the real - life marriage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meredith Baxter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Birney</ENAMEX> .
Clearly , the question with `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chicken Soup</ENAMEX> '' is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all .
So far , the bubbles have been few and far between .
Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms , ever since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the didactic days</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Lear</ENAMEX> , to preach about social issues .
To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them .
For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> dislikes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> not because he 's a shrewd <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> businessman , but because he quits his well - paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker .
Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> 's comic persona .
The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB- and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old - fashioned <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> mischief to other people as well as to himself .
But too often , these routines lack spark because this sitcom , like all sitcoms , is timid about confronting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> 's stock in trade - ethnic differences .
I 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Catholic</ENAMEX> - Jewish dispute over the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Carmelite</ENAMEX> convent at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Auschwitz</ENAMEX> .
That issue , like racial tensions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> , will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can simmer .
But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about `` caring for other people '' that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss America</ENAMEX> .
At your age , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> , you ought to know that you ca n't make soup without turning up the flame .
