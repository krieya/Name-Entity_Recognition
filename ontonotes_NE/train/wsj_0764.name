Energetic and concrete action has been taken in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 60 days</ENAMEX> against the mafiosi of the drug trade , but it has not been sufficiently effective , because , unfortunately , it came too late .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Ten years ago</ENAMEX> , the newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">El Espectador</ENAMEX> , of which my brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guillermo</ENAMEX> was editor , began warning of the rise of the drug mafias and of their leaders ' aspirations to control <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Colombian</ENAMEX> politics , especially the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> .
Then , when it would have been easier to resist them , nothing was done and my brother was murdered by the drug mafias <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</ENAMEX> .
The most ruthless dictatorships have not censored their press more brutally than the drug mafias censor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX> 's .
The censorship is enforced through terrorism and assassination .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 10 years</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 50</ENAMEX> journalists have been silenced forever , murdered .
Within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two months</ENAMEX> a bomb exploded in the offices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the El Espectador</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bogota</ENAMEX> , destroying a major part of its installations and equipment .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only last week</ENAMEX> the newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vanguardia Liberal</ENAMEX> in the city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bucaramanga</ENAMEX> was bombed , and its installations destroyed .
Journalists and their families are constantly threatened as are the newspaper distribution outlets .
Distribution centers are bombed , and advertisers are intimidated .
Censorship is imposed by terrorism .
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Colombian</ENAMEX> media accept this new and hideous censorship there is little doubt that the drug mafia 's terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers published in the free world .
The solidarity of the uncensored media world - wide against drug terrorism is the only way press freedom can survive .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> people and their government also woke up too late to the menace drugs posed to the moral structure of their country .
Even now , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> attack upon this tremendous problem is timid in relation to the magnitude of the threat .
I can attest that a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Colombian</ENAMEX> visitor to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> was offered drugs <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> times in the few blocks ' walk between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grand Central Terminal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Waldorf Astoria Hotel</ENAMEX> in midtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX> alone -- its government , its people , its newspapers -- does not have the capacity to fight this battle successfully .
All drug - consuming countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , as the major drug consumer , should lead this joint effort .
Reduction , if not the total cessation , of drug consumption is the requirement for victory .
Much is being done in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX> to fight the drug cartel mafia .
Luxurious homes and ranches have been raided by the military authorities , and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 300</ENAMEX> planes and helicopters have been impounded at airports , and a large number of vehicles and launches has been confiscated .
The military has also captured enormous arsenals of powerful and sophisticated weapons , explosives and other war - like materiel .
Much has been accomplished and public opinion decisively supports the government and the army -- but , on the other hand , none of the key drug barons have been captured .
There has been a lot of talk that a large portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Colombian</ENAMEX> economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money .
In my opinion , this is not true .
Laundered drug money has served only to increase , unrealistically , the price of real estate , creating serious problems for low - income people who aspire to own their own homes .
Drug money has also gone to buy expensive cars , airplanes , launches and nightclubs where drugs are consumed .
But most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial institutions outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX> .
In fact , the cooperation of those financial institutions is essential to the success of the drug battle .
What is of much more importance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Colombian</ENAMEX> economy than the supposed benefits of laundered drug money is higher prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX> 's legitimate products .
The price of coffee has gone down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 45 %</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the year</ENAMEX> , to the lowest level -LRB- after inflation -RRB- since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Great Depression</ENAMEX> .
Market conditions point to even lower prices <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">27 - year - old</ENAMEX> coffee cartel had to be formally dissolved <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</ENAMEX> .
As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX> will earn <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</ENAMEX> less from its coffee <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> than last .
Our coffee growers face reductions in their income , and this tempts them to contemplate substituting coca crops for coffee .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> interests occasionally try to impose barriers to the import of another important <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Colombian</ENAMEX> export -- cut flowers -- into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> market .
A just price and an open market for what <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Colombian</ENAMEX> produces and exports should be the policy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
I take advantage of this opportunity given to me by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> to make a plea to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the millions</ENAMEX> of readers of this newspaper , to become soldiers dedicated to the fight against the use of drugs .
Each <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</ENAMEX> of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world who fight this terrible scourge .
A crusade of NO to the consumption of drugs is imperative .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cano</ENAMEX> is president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">El Espectador</ENAMEX> , a newspaper founded by his grandfather .
