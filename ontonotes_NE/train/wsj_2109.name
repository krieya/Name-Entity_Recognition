<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Geographic</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</ENAMEX> - largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> magazine , is attracting more readers than ever and offers the glossy , high - toned pages that upscale advertisers love .
So why did advertising pages plunge by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 10 %</ENAMEX> and ad revenue by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.2 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half</ENAMEX> ?
To hear advertisers tell it , the magazine just has n't kept up with the times .
Despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the Third World , it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to flip through in search of topless tribe women .
Worse , it lagged behind competitors in offering now - standard gimmicks , from regional editions to discounts for frequent advertisers .
But now , the magazine is attempting to fight back , with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign .
Advertisers do n't think of the magazine first , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan McCraw</ENAMEX> , who joined in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April</ENAMEX> as national advertising director .
`` What we want to do is take a more aggressive stance .
People did n't believe we were in tune with the marketplace , and in many ways we were n't . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">101 - year - old</ENAMEX> magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much fervor before .
It largely rested on its hard - to - fault demographics : <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.8 million</ENAMEX> subscribers in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half</ENAMEX> , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.5 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</ENAMEX> ; an average age of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">42</ENAMEX> for readers -- at the height of their consuming years ; loyalty to the tune of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</ENAMEX> average subscription renewal rate .
The magazine had its best year yet in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , when it celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">its centennial</ENAMEX> and racked up a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</ENAMEX> gain in ad pages , to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">283</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , when the hullabaloo surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">its centennial</ENAMEX> died , so too did some advertiser interest .
The reason , ad executives say , is that the entire magazine business has been soft -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Geographic</ENAMEX> has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market .
Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices -- $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">130,000</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - color page , vs. $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">47,000</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Smithsonian</ENAMEX> , a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation .
When ad dollars are tight , the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers , who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all .
Even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Geographic</ENAMEX> offers far more readers than does a magazine like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Smithsonian</ENAMEX> , `` the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Glass</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> media manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bozell Inc</ENAMEX> .
To combat that problem , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Geographic</ENAMEX> , like other magazines , began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines -- for example , ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</ENAMEX> markets .
But the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions , and until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> offered fewer of them than did competitors .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Time</ENAMEX> magazine , for example , has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</ENAMEX> separate editions going to different regions , top management , and other groups .
Another sticking point for advertisers was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Geographic 's</ENAMEX> tradition of lumping its ads together , usually at the beginning or end of the magazine , rather than spreading ads out among its articles , as most magazines do .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Geographic 's</ENAMEX> smaller - than - average size means extra production costs for advertisers .
But Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCraw</ENAMEX> says the magazine is fighting back .
It now offers <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> regional editions , it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles , and it has been beefing up its sales force .
And it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief executives , marketing directors , and media executives just that .
The centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign , into which the magazine will pour <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 500,000</ENAMEX> , mostly in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few weeks</ENAMEX> .
The campaign , created by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Omnicom Group 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DDB Needham</ENAMEX> agency , takes advantage of the eye - catching photography that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Geographic</ENAMEX> is known for .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> ad , a photo of the interior of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Sainte - Chapelle</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> is paired with the headline , `` The only book more respected than ours does n't accept advertising . ''
Another ad pictures a tree ant , magnified <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</ENAMEX> times , with the headline , `` For impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions . ''
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCraw</ENAMEX> says she wants the campaign to help attract advertisers in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> categories , including corporate , financial services , consumer electronics , insurance and food .
Her goal : to top <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</ENAMEX> ad pages in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 274</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
Whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain .
`` The ad campaign is meant to contemporize the thought of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Geographic</ENAMEX> , '' she says .
`` We want it to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">'90s</ENAMEX> kind of image . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WCRS</ENAMEX> Plans Ad - Unit Sale
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WCRS Group</ENAMEX> hopes to announce , perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , an agreement to sell the majority of its ad unit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eurocom</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> ad executive said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WCRS</ENAMEX> has been in discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eurocom</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</ENAMEX> .
However , when negotiations bogged down recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WCRS</ENAMEX> 's chief executive , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Scott</ENAMEX> , met in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> with another <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> firm , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BDDP</ENAMEX> .
According to the executive , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BDDP</ENAMEX> 's involvement prompted renewed vigor in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WCRS</ENAMEX> - Eurocom talks and the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> agencies were hoping to hammer out details by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
Executives of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> agencies could n't be reached <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</ENAMEX> .
