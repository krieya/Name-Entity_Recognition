<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Justice Department</ENAMEX> said it is seeking to join a private lawsuit challenging a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> suburb 's zoning ordinance that sharply restricts the locations available to group homes for the handicapped .
This would be the department 's first suit challenging a local zoning ordinance under <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> amendments to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Fair Housing Act</ENAMEX> .
Under those amendments , which took effect in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March of this year</ENAMEX> , the federal government can intervene in private housing - discrimination lawsuits .
The ordinance , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moon Township</ENAMEX> , prohibits locating a group home for the handicapped within <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</ENAMEX> of another such facility .
In papers filed with the federal district court in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> alleged that the ordinance , by limiting the number of group homes that can be established in the township , makes housing unavailable on account of handicap .
The private suit was brought by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> mentally retarded people who live in a group home in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moon</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Smith</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moon Township</ENAMEX> manager , said the ordinance is intended to prevent the concentration of group homes for the mentally retarded from changing `` the character and flavor of the neighborhood . ''
He said the ordinance also will benefit the mentally retarded .
`` Our intent is to spread them out '' to insure they are well integrated into the community , he said .
