Yet another superstore chain has come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 9</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tesco</ENAMEX> said hello to consumers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> when it formally opened its clean , bright and spacious store .
There are now about <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> retailers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> with individual stores of at least <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several thousand ping</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a ping</ENAMEX> equals <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36 square feet</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
With the full adoption of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - day</ENAMEX> weekends every other week , people in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> have had to figure out what to do with these new days off .
Visiting superstores - with their ample parking , restaurants and piles of consumer goods - has become a major leisure - time activity .
What kind of social changes does <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's consumer behavior reflect ?
Is densely populated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> well suited to absorb all these stores , which are sprouting up like mushrooms after a rain ?
Waves of traffic are heading out from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> toward the suburbs , toward the open expanses in the riverbed area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neihu</ENAMEX> .
Once the cars pass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Minchuan or the Second Macarthur Bridge</ENAMEX> , the landscape becomes dotted with the large signs of major retailers .
These include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Costco</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> largest superstore retailer in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">B-AMP-Q</ENAMEX> , the largest do - it - yourself hardware chain in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RT - Mart</ENAMEX> .
Shopping at these large stores has quickly become a part of leisure - time life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
A Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chao</ENAMEX> , who lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neihu</ENAMEX> , explains that on weekends or vacation days the whole family sleeps late .
Once they are up , if there 's nothing special on the agenda , they go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">B-AMP-Q</ENAMEX> to look at stuff for the home .
Then when they get tired , they go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Costco</ENAMEX> for some Pizza or muffins .
Finally , they end up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RT - Mart</ENAMEX> , where they buy groceries .
The whole trip takes <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">about half the day</ENAMEX> .
She had thought that these stores were only crowded on the weekends , but on a rainy weekday in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> she decided she did n't feel like cooking and went to buy some prepared foods at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the RT - Mart 's</ENAMEX> deli department .
She discovered that there was n't a single open parking space among the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> floors of the parking structure .
She was quite surprised to find that business was so good on a weekday .
" Shopping at one of these superstores is a lot like shopping at a department store , " says a Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ko</ENAMEX> , who works as an engineer for a chemical company in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kaohsiung</ENAMEX> .
" You go when you 're bored . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ko</ENAMEX> has discovered that as more and more of these stores have opened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kaohsiung</ENAMEX> , he and his wife go to department stores less , because in department stores you can only buy clothes , but in superstores you can buy daily necessities , hardware and so forth , and the selection is better .
Shocking the world
The performance of these large retailers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> has been startling , and superstore chains from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> have been arriving on these shores <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> after another .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A hundred - some</ENAMEX> foreign stores do <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 110 billion</ENAMEX> in business a year .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Finance 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Office of Statistics</ENAMEX> , business in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first quarter of 2000</ENAMEX> for these stores was up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.54 %</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the same quarter the previous year</ENAMEX> , a higher rate of growth than for convenience stores , supermarkets or department stores .
Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Dutch</ENAMEX> firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Makro</ENAMEX> opened its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> store in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taoyuan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> , superstores have enjoyed tremendous growth .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> retailer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Carrefour</ENAMEX> followed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Makro</ENAMEX> 's lead , opening a store in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Costco</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> began planning its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> store in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> wholesale outlet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Casino</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A year earlier</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ruentex</ENAMEX> group , which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RT - Mart</ENAMEX> , bought out <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> competitors and increased its number of stores to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">That same year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tesco</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> began to look for sites .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly three years</ENAMEX> of preparation , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</ENAMEX> they finally opened their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> store in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taoyuan</ENAMEX> .
No one had expected that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> superstores would be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> to establish a foothold in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , which had long taken its cues from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Tien</ENAMEX> , the head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Carrefour</ENAMEX> 's public affairs division in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , relates that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wal</ENAMEX>
