Applause
d the extra $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">400</ENAMEX> per child to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> families <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</ENAMEX> .
All together these tax reductions will help <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> , and a significant part of the benefit to our economy will come within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two years</ENAMEX> of the plan .
A family of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> with an income of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">40,000</ENAMEX> would receive a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96 %</ENAMEX> reduction in federal income taxes .
Instead of paying $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,178</ENAMEX> per year , the family would pay $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">45</ENAMEX> a year .
Applause
That means extra money in the family budget year after year .
That money can cover a lot of bills .
That money can help families with purchases they have been delaying .
That money will be in circulation , which will be good for our economy .
Applause
And this plan will help our small business sector .
The benefits of the growth plan will come from increased consumer spending and , as importantly , from a lower income tax rates on the small businesses themselves .
It is important for our fellow citizens to understand that most small businesses pay their business taxes at the individual rates .
Most small businesses are sole proprietorships , limited partnerships , are subchapter SS , and , therefore , when you reduce individual tax rates , you benefit small business formation .
As a matter of fact , under this plan , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 23 million</ENAMEX> small business owners will see their taxes cut , which leaves more money for investment , more money for growth , more money for job creation .
A growing economy also needs small business investment , and our tax code should encourage investment .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> a small business can deduct a maximum of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">25,000</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</ENAMEX> in which they buy equipment .
We need to triple the amount that can be deducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</ENAMEX> in which they buy equipment .
Applause
So I propose to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> that they ought to limit -- limit ought to be increased to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">75,000</ENAMEX> and that limit ought to be indexed to inflation .
By doing so , we promote greater investment in machinery , and when a small business buys machine that enhances their company 's productivity as well as it means machinery manufacturer is likely to have more work available .
More investment equals jobs , and what we are interested in in this administration is helping people who look for work find a job .
Applause
We can also promote economic growth and job creation by removing the double tax on dividends .
Applause
Taxing corporate income once is fair .
It is not fair for the federal government to tax the same money twice .
The burden of double taxation falls on the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</ENAMEX> of individuals who receive dividends , falls especially hard on seniors who receive <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> of all dividend income .
Removal of double taxation would put more money in the hands of investors .
It would encourage more investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> businesses .
Economists say that this plan will help our stock markets , and since <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> families own stock , the reform will help them save and help our economy grow .
Now , these measures were presented to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first week of this year</ENAMEX> .
The pro-growth package was urgent in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> .
It 's even more urgent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
Applause
It is important for you all to understand and for our fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> to understand the tax relief that I have proposed and will push for until enacted would create -- applause will create <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4 million</ENAMEX> new jobs by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 2004</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> time , this nation has experienced war , a recession and a national emergency , which has caused our government to run a deficit .
The best way to reduce the deficit is with more growth in our economy , which means more revenues to our treasury , and less spending in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington , D.C</ENAMEX> .
applause
I am pleased that both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> have passed budget resolutions that show real spending restraint , and now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> must focus on a robust and effective growth package .
We need <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 550 billion</ENAMEX> in that package because the more tax relief that goes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> people , the more jobs we will create in this economy .
Applause
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">The last few months</ENAMEX> have been a time of challenge for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> .
Our resolve has been tested , yet we have the great resources of national strength , and national character , to overcome every challenge we face .
Our confidence and our optimism have never waivered .
We are defending the peace of the world .
We 're bringing freedom to corners of the world who have n't seen freedom in years .
We 're all building the prosperity of our country .
This is a unique moment in our history and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> people are rising to meet it .
I want to thank each of you for your hard work .
I want to thank each of you for the faith you have shown in this country 's future .
May <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> bless you , and may <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> continue to bless <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> .
