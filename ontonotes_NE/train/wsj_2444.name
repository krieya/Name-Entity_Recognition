Of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm , few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease .
To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment , however , the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms .
It must also evaluate the real - estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective .
Specifically , it must understand how real - estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities .
When a regional economy catches cold , the local real - estate market gets pneumonia .
In other words , real - estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , plummet much further than a local economy in recession .
This was seen in the late <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1960s</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1970s</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
But the reverse is also true : When a region 's economy rebounds from a slowdown , these real - estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy .
Why do local real - estate markets overreact to regional economic cycles ?
Because real - estate purchases and leases are such major long - term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Metropolitan Detroit</ENAMEX> was written off economically during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</ENAMEX> , as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment .
Area employment dropped by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</ENAMEX> from its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</ENAMEX> peak and retail sales were down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</ENAMEX> .
However , the real - estate market was hurt even more .
For example , residential building permits in the trough year of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> were off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76 %</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</ENAMEX> peak level .
Once metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> 's economy rallied in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980s</ENAMEX> , real estate rebounded .
Building permits , for example , soared a staggering <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">400 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1982 and the peak year of 1986</ENAMEX> .
Where , savvy corporations and professional firms are now asking , are <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's opportunities ?
Look no further than metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of the most depressed , overbuilt and potentially undervalued real - estate markets in the nation .
Of course , some observers have touted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five years</ENAMEX> as a counter-cyclical play .
But now appears to be the time to act .
Metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> 's economy did drop and then flatten in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</ENAMEX> after its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> peak .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980s</ENAMEX> , employment was down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 5 %</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> peak and retail sales were off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</ENAMEX> .
The real - estate market suffered even more severe setbacks .
Office construction dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97 %</ENAMEX> .
The vacancy rate soared <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</ENAMEX> in nearly every product category , and more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> of office space was vacant .
To some observers , the empty office buildings of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> 's `` see - through skyline '' were indicative of a very troubled economy .
As usual , the real - estate market had overreacted .
Actually , the region 's economy retained a firm foundation .
Metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> 's population has held steady over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past six years</ENAMEX> .
And personal income , after slumping in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980s</ENAMEX> , has returned to its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> level in real dollar terms .
Today , metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> 's real - estate market is poised for a significant turnaround .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 42,000</ENAMEX> jobs were added in metro <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , primarily in biotechnology , petrochemical processing , and the computer industry .
This growth puts <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> in the top <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> metro areas in the nation <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
And forecasts project a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 % to 3 %</ENAMEX> growth rate in jobs over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few years</ENAMEX> -- nearly twice the national average .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> is another metropolitan area where the commercial real - estate market has overreacted to the region 's economic trends , although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> .
By some measures , metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> 's economy has actually improved in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past four years</ENAMEX> .
Its population has continued to increase since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the peak year</ENAMEX> of the economic cycle .
Employment is now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</ENAMEX> higher than in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</ENAMEX> .
Buying income in real dollars actually increased <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1983 and 1987</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the most recent year</ENAMEX> available -RRB- .
The rates of increase , however , are less than the rapid growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the boom years</ENAMEX> , and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy .
In a self - fulfilling prophecy , therefore , the region 's real - estate market all but collapsed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
Housing building permits are down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 75 %</ENAMEX> from their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</ENAMEX> peaks .
Although no one can predict when metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> 's real - estate market will rebound , major public works projects costing <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">several billion dollars</ENAMEX> are under way or planned -- such as a new convention center , a major beltway encircling the metropolitan area , and a new regional airport .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> 's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as next year</ENAMEX> -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real - estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound .
What real - estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> 's or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> 's ?
Generally , overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1980s</ENAMEX> peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
Vacancy rates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % to 19 %</ENAMEX> range <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> may easily rise to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">low to mid-20 %</ENAMEX> range in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</ENAMEX> .
Under these conditions , even a flattening out of economic growth -- `` catching cold '' -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia .
Those looking for real - estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short - term -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - year</ENAMEX> -RRB- lease and wait for the bargains ahead .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leinberger</ENAMEX> is managing partner of a real - estate advisory firm based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif</ENAMEX> .
