And at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">one forty - five Universal time</ENAMEX> you are listening to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Voice of America</ENAMEX> .
Monkey experiments by an international research team have reversed the brain degeneration typical of Parkinson 's Disease by placing repair proteins inside a disabled AIDS virus .
As we hear from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David McAlary</ENAMEX> , the work is being hailed as a breakthrough in an effort to end Parkinson 's deterioration .
Patients with advanced Parkinson 's are easy to spot .
Degeneration of brain cells or neurons causes them to shake , shuffle and stoop .
The neurons produce less and less of the chemical dopamine that helps relay signals between them .
Dopamine replacement with drugs is the main therapy but it loses effectiveness as the disease progresses .
The next step is transplanting nerve tissue from a fetus to replace the lost dopamine neurons , but that is a costly , risky surgery .
Now a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Swiss</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> group has successfully tested a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> approach in monkeys , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> that delivers the seeds of a dopamine neuron nourishment protein directly to the brain by injection .
It works as a protectant of the cell so to stop the disease in its tracks .
This is study leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffery Codover</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rush Presbyterian St. Lukes Medical Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
The stimulating brain protein his team used is called GDNF .
Previous studies have shown that GDNF keeps dopamine cells healthy but the problem has been getting it to the brain .
As a defense , the brain 's blood vessels prevent most compounds from entering from the blood stream making it difficult to design a Parkinson 's drug .
To overcome this , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Codover</ENAMEX> 's team injected a gene to make GDNF right into the monkey 's brains .
To transport the gene , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Louisiane University</ENAMEX> researchers devised an HIV virus stripped of its infecting machinery .
When they injected the altered virus into brains of aging animals with early Parkinson 's it conveyed the attached GDNF gene efficiently , causing dopamine cells to produce the rescue protein on site .
When we delivered GDNF via gene therapy in these aged monkeys we were able to completely reverse all the cellular changes , degenerative changes that are seen in aged monkeys as they relate to Parkinson 's Disease .
The researchers report in the journal <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Science</ENAMEX> that the gene therapy also restored coordinated movement in young monkeys in which Parkinson 's was chemically induced .
The benefits of the treatment appear permanent or at least very long - lasting as GDNF genes continually produce the rescue protein .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Codover</ENAMEX> says that in people , it would be tested as preventive therapy rather than one for existing symptoms .
Most current clinical trials in Parkinson 's Disease are directed towards symptomatic therapy or towards more advanced patients .
This type of therapy is directed towards more early patients with the emphasis on preventing the progression of the disease rather than replacing lost neurons or more symptomatic types of benefits .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockholm</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Carolinska Institute</ENAMEX> neuroscientist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lars Olson</ENAMEX> says if gene delivery works well in people , it would be the best Parkinson 's treatment yet .
It would be better because you would n't have to take medication and you would n't have to do cell transplantation either .
It might be a treatment that you would have to do only once or perhaps a few times during life with the illness .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olson</ENAMEX> says the treatment might also be applied to other brain diseases in which nerve cells degenerate , but he warns of a major hurdle in assuring patients get the proper dose of gene therapy because too much is bad .
If you over - stimulate other neighboring dopamine neurons you might get side effects similar to some of the symptoms seen in schizophrenia for instance .
For use in patients one would like to have a system where the activity of the delivered gene could be controlled .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffery Cooover</ENAMEX> says he is now testing ways of regulating gene delivery in monkeys .
He hopes to try the procedure in people within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> government review .
