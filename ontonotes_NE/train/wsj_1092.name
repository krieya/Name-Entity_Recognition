This is in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atsushi Kageyama 's</ENAMEX> Manager 's Journal , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Looking for the Real Thing in Sony</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- editorial page , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 2</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Though I agree with many of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kageyama</ENAMEX> 's comments , I believe he points the gun in the wrong direction : It is n't the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> who must be criticized for not understanding the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> culture , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> who insist on forcing their culture on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> want us to accept their culture , but they refuse to accept the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> culture .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> managers ca n't expect <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> to behave as if they were <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> ; instead , they must manage <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> are expected to conform to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> culture when in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
What is wrong with expecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> to conform to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> norms when they locate here ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> place native or native speakers in charge of subsidiaries overseas .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> multinationals do likewise ; even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , their affiliates are usually run by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> managers .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> insist upon <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> managers everywhere they set up shop .
Do the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> feel so superior that they can not find capable <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> managers ?

Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kageyama</ENAMEX> suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kotobuki Electronics Industries</ENAMEX> workers were having difficulty understanding their foreign bosses ' perspective .
While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kageyama</ENAMEX> does an excellent job of explaining the differences , both cultural and philosophic , I question his perspective .
Would he suggest that employees of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> company doing business in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> conform to their new bosses ' culture and philosophy ?
Obviously not .
Thus the conclusion is that the burden rests with management to understand / adopt the culture and philosophy of the country in which they are operating .
The workers can be motivated , and the company reach its full potential , only when management embraces the employees ' perspective .

I believe Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kageyama</ENAMEX> left out <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> major aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> culture that permeated his piece : the belief in the superiority of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> culture and behavior vs. others .
A manager should not have to rebut the opinions of his employees about the style of his management .
Instead , he should listen to see how that criticism can be used constructively to advance his objective of carrying out a set of tasks through the efforts of his subordinates .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> culture vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> culture is irrelevant .
The key is how a manager from one culture can motivate employees from another .
For Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kageyama</ENAMEX> to argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> employees must passively accept a direct imposition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> way of doing things is outright cultural chauvinism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> order .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> are neglecting the opportunity to synthesize a new corporate culture based on a fusion of the best aspects of both national cultures .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kageyama</ENAMEX> is accurate to deny a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="5">anti-American</ENAMEX> bias .
It is more difficult to deny a general bigotry in seeing things only the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> way .
When the response to criticism is only a better explanation of policies without altering the reasons for the criticism , I am convinced that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kageyama</ENAMEX> has still failed to attack the root cause of the problem and is simply treating symptoms .
