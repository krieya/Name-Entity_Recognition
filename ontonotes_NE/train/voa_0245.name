Welcome back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VOA News</ENAMEX> now coming to you from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
I am <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Riggs</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> could begin a marathon round of peace talks as early as <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> has not yet said whether it will take part .
Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Barak</ENAMEX> is postponing until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> his government 's response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> 's proposal for talks .
Correspondent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurie Cassman</ENAMEX> reports from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> is under pressure to go ahead with the peace effort .
Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> is to meet with his top ministers involved in the peace process on <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Saturday night</ENAMEX> to decide what response to give to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat</ENAMEX> 's proposal .
The meeting was delayed a day in protest after the brutal killing of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> youth in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the West Bank</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> have proposed a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten - day</ENAMEX> non-stop negotiating session to narrow differences over key issues blocking a final peace agreement .
If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> says yes , the marathon meeting will probably take place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Red Sea</ENAMEX> resort of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taba</ENAMEX> just across the border from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> TV says the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> already are sending an advanced team to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taba</ENAMEX> to prepare for the meeting .
The talks would come in an awkward moment for Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> who is facing an uphill battle to keep his job .
The latest opinion polls show right wing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Likud Party</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ariel Sharon</ENAMEX> could easily win the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February 6th</ENAMEX> election .
Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> had hoped for a peace deal to clinch victory .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ariel Sharon</ENAMEX> has already said he would not honor Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> 's compromise proposals .
He says his negotiating position with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> would be much tougher .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon</ENAMEX> 's peace plan would retain <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> sovereignty over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Golan Heights</ENAMEX> , which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> seized from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the 1967 Arab - Israeli war</ENAMEX> .
The plan would also cut in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Bank</ENAMEX> land <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> is to turn over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sharon</ENAMEX> talks of long term interest talks push for a single final peace settlement .
