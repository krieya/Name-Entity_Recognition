As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen Boehm</ENAMEX> , who owns an art porcelain company , sipped her luncheon cocktail , she reeled off the names of a few pals -- Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> , Princess <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah Ferguson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kluge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton Petrie</ENAMEX> .
Then , flashing a diamond ring as big as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ritz</ENAMEX> -LRB- `` my day diamond , darling '' -RRB- , she told her <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> companions that she is on the `` board '' of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Vatican Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> .
As it turns out , the board has a lot of important members , including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winton Blount</ENAMEX> -LRB- former postmaster general of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Gaisman</ENAMEX> -LRB- widow of the inventor of auto - strop razor -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Murphy</ENAMEX> -LRB- an investment banker at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch -AMP- Co</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
But Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boehm</ENAMEX> did n't mention any of them .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen Boehm</ENAMEX> has a way with names , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Revson</ENAMEX> , a gossip columnist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Newsday</ENAMEX> -LRB- and son of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Revson</ENAMEX> , a founder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Revlon</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Like which are droppable and which are not .
With <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall social season</ENAMEX> well under way , name - droppers are out in force , trying to impress their betters and sometimes put down their lessers .
But the truth is that almost everyone , from real - estate agents to city fathers , name - drops ; and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle who claims he lived next door to the cartoonist who did <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Katzenjammer Kids</ENAMEX> .
-LRB- In case you have forgotten , his name was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Dirks</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
`` Name - dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Freudenberger</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> psychoanalyst , with a high - powered clientele .
`` It can be an avenue of entrance to a certain sector of society ... .
It provides some people a needed sense of affiliation and can help open up a conversation with someone you do n't know . ''
Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Long Island</ENAMEX> matron in the theater district <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</ENAMEX> who swore to a stranger that she once met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liza Minnelli</ENAMEX> .
`` I was having a drink in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sardi 's</ENAMEX> , when all of a sudden I saw a woman 's backside coming up the steps on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> floor and she was wearing sequined slacks .
I knew it was someone important , so I followed her into the ladies room and sure enough , it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liza</ENAMEX> .
So I said , ` Hello . '
And she said , ` Hello . '
Can you imagine ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liza</ENAMEX> said hello to me . ''
Some people must drop names -- call it an irresistible impulse .
`` They ca n't help talking about the big important people they know , even if they do n't really know them , '' says Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freudenberger</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beauregard Houston - Montgomery</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> writer who changed his name from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Stretch</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> , is an inveterate name - dropper .
`` I do it innately and pathologically , and while it may occasionally get me into trouble , it 's also gotten me access to parties and society , '' he says .
Name - dropping recently helped Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Houston - Montgomery</ENAMEX> crash a party <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fame</ENAMEX> magazine threw for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,809</ENAMEX> people mentioned in the diaries of the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Warhol</ENAMEX> .
`` I guess I might have asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beauregard</ENAMEX> to leave , but he drops so many good names , we decided to let him stay , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Greenberg</ENAMEX> , publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fame</ENAMEX> .
`` After all , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warhol</ENAMEX> was the ultimate namedropper , dropping <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> a day in his diaries .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beauregard</ENAMEX> was mentioned twice -- although very briefly and in passing . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Houston - Montgomery</ENAMEX> says that at the party he waved to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Forbes</ENAMEX> , publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Forbes</ENAMEX> magazine -LRB- `` We've been in the columns together '' -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Boone</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> art dealer -LRB- `` I think she knows me , but I 'm not sure '' -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridget Fonda</ENAMEX> , the actress -LRB- `` She knows me , but we 're not really the best of friends '' -RRB- .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Revson</ENAMEX> , the gossip columnist , says there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before attending a party .
These droppers do n't flaunt only their friendships with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trumps</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooke Astor</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Georgette Mosbacher</ENAMEX> .
`` They even drop semi-obscure names like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfgang Flottl</ENAMEX> , whom everybody <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> apparently has heard of but no one really knows , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Revson</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's the one - upsmanship of name - dropping that counts . ''
But name - dropping has other benefits , often civic .
In the name of civic pride and from the desire to nullify a negative image , some city promoters seek to link their municipality with the most recognizable names the city has to offer .
Take <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> .
It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Cuyahoga River</ENAMEX> caught fire , because former Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Perk</ENAMEX> set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame</ENAMEX> was recently refused an urban - development grant .
Some people call it `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Mistake on the Lake</ENAMEX> '' -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Lake Erie</ENAMEX> , that is .
`` It helps to point out how many important people came through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> on their way to the top , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Miller</ENAMEX> , executive director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New Cleveland Campaign</ENAMEX> , a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> notes that actor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Newman</ENAMEX> 's family owned a sporting - goods store in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> , that the late actress <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Hamilton</ENAMEX> , who played the bad witch in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Wizard Of Oz</ENAMEX> , '' once ran a nursery school in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> and that comedian <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Hope</ENAMEX> 's father , a stonemason , once worked on a church next to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Severence Hall</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> 's main concert hall .
`` Power names like that do n't hurt the city 's reputation , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> says .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> , an average family can gain cachet from moving into a home vacated by the famous or near famous .
`` Why we even just sold a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> - bedroom house in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van Nuys</ENAMEX> and were able to keep the price firm in a weak real - estate market by noting that the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lone Ranger</ENAMEX> lived there , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Rambo</ENAMEX> , a sales associate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jon Douglas Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> real - estate agency .
`` Most people ca n't even remember his name . ''
-LRB- It is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hart</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rambo</ENAMEX> says that a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.2 - acre</ENAMEX> property overlooking <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the San Fernando Valley</ENAMEX> is priced at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 million</ENAMEX> because the late actor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erroll Flynn</ENAMEX> once lived there .
`` If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flynn</ENAMEX> had n't lived there , the property might have been priced <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</ENAMEX> lower , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rambo</ENAMEX> , noting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flynn</ENAMEX> 's house has been bulldozed , and only the swimming pool remains .
Press agents and public - relations practitioners are notorious name - droppers .
And some even do it with malice aforethought .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Len Kessler</ENAMEX> , a financial publicist in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , sometimes uses it to get the attention of journalists who try to avoid him .
He says that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Dorfman</ENAMEX> , a financial columnist with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USA Today</ENAMEX> , has n't returned his phone calls , he leaves messages with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorfman</ENAMEX> 's office saying that he has an important story on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meshulam Riklis</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX> .
He admits he has no story on any of them on these occasions .
`` But it does get him to return my calls , and it makes me feel better for the times he 's given me the brushoff , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kessler</ENAMEX> says .
There are , of course , obvious dangers to blatant , unsubstantiated name - dropping .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffry Thal</ENAMEX> , a publicity agent for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Lantz Office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , warns that dropping the wrong name labels the dropper as a fake and a fraud .
`` Get caught and you 're dead in the water , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thal</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thal</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Taylor</ENAMEX> , a client , `` hates being called ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liz</ENAMEX> . ' ...
If directors or producers phone me and say they know ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liz</ENAMEX> , ' I know they 've never met her .
She prefers ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth</ENAMEX> . ' ''
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> society , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Buckley</ENAMEX> , the very social wife of author <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Buckley</ENAMEX> , has the nicknames `` Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buckles</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patsy</ENAMEX> . ''
And her husband sometimes calls her `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ducky</ENAMEX> . ''
`` But call her ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patty</ENAMEX> , ' and it 's a sure giveaway you 're not in her circle , because she does n't use that name , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Kron</ENAMEX> , editor - in - chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Avenue</ENAMEX> magazine , a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> publication sent to all the right names .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Spencer Churchill</ENAMEX> , a nephew of the late Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Churchill</ENAMEX> , former prime minister of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Britain</ENAMEX> , is n't that impressed with most name - droppers he meets .
That 's because they only drop `` mere names , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churchill</ENAMEX> .
Currently writing his memoirs , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churchill</ENAMEX> , an artist , tells how tycoons such as the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Paul Getty</ENAMEX> , the oil billionnaire , were , in fact , known only by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> initial , their last .
`` When you 're at the club , you ask whether they 've spoken to ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G</ENAMEX> . '
Now they know who you mean and you know who you mean .
But no one else does .
Now that 's name - dropping , if you know what I mean .
