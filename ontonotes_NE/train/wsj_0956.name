In a corner of the cavernous , new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nippon Convention Center</ENAMEX> sits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mazda Motor Corp. 's</ENAMEX> advanced - technology display .
The highlight : a `` fragrance control system . ''
With the touch of a button , drivers can choose from lavender , jasmine , mint or perfume scents , all blown in through the car 's air - conditioning system .
The soft , wafting aromas will `` improve ride comfort , '' the display attests , and a proud employee says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mazda</ENAMEX> hopes to move the system out of the lab and into its cars in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> .
Welcome to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">28th</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tokyo Motor Show</ENAMEX> .
Here you can find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> displaying a `` live fish transporter , '' a truck akin to an aquarium on wheels , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan Motor Co.</ENAMEX> with its `` keyless '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boga</ENAMEX> , whose doors unlock upon recognizing the owner 's fingerprints .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Suzuki Motor Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Escudome</ENAMEX> sport vehicle features a pop - out rear tent and invites drivers to go `` back to the nature . ''
But this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">biennial</ENAMEX> event , the world 's largest display of cars and trucks , has its serious side , including the first major exhibitions of future engines and vehicle - suspension systems .
It 's also the prime showcase for a country whose world dominance in the industry is increasingly acknowledged , and therein lies the draw .
Even the biggest auto shows in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> are largely regional affairs , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> show is international .
Virtually every automotive analyst in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> showed up .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> - to - Tokyo flights were booked solid <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Motor City</ENAMEX> executives , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald E. Petersen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> Vice Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Greenwald</ENAMEX> , flocked to see the future .
Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> came , for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">24 years</ENAMEX> , to show off its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lada Niva</ENAMEX> sedan and its futuristic dark - blue `` Kompakt '' model .
Here 's a firsthand look at what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> hosts sported , and what the foreign visitors saw .
New Technology
The hottest displays were items that insulate passengers from bumps , potholes and other rigors of the road .
These `` active suspension systems '' electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car 's ride .
Existing suspension systems try to absorb bounces , but active suspension provides power to counter the jolts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> , in a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</ENAMEX> - page tract , modestly compares its `` hydraulic active suspension '' to a cheetah , and equates the various parts to the animal 's heart , brain , nerves and blood vessels .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> grandly touted its system in a car that splits in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> to reveal the suspension 's inner workings .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissan</ENAMEX> says it will introduce its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> system <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Infiniti</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Q45</ENAMEX> luxury sedan , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Celica</ENAMEX> coupe will go on sale with the suspension device <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next spring</ENAMEX> .
But drivers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> must wait : The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> , for now , are keeping active suspension for domestic use only .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> 's Big Three auto makers say their systems are still under development .
In the engine department , several companies displayed experimental models that within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</ENAMEX> could provide power equal to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's engines and yet take up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only half</ENAMEX> the space , allowing for shorter hoods .
In the so - called <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - stroke engines , which are expected to get sharply higher gas mileage , each piston goes up and down only once to provide power .
By contrast , the pistons in conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - stroke engines must move up and down twice in each power cycle .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - stroke engine displays by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fuji Heavy Industries</ENAMEX> , the maker of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Subaru</ENAMEX> cars , drew plenty of interest from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto executives , who are rushing to develop <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - stroke engines .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda Motor Co.</ENAMEX> shows a more conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> - cylinder engine in the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accord Inspire</ENAMEX> model , which made its debut <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">just this month</ENAMEX> -- in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> only .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> - cylinder engine provides a compromise between the fuel - economy of a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - cylinder , and the power of a V - <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</ENAMEX> .
It is rumored to be bound for a new model in the luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Acura</ENAMEX> line in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda</ENAMEX> officials would n't comment .
Odd Cars , Funny Names
There 's plenty of whimsy here , but it is n't always clear whether it 's intentional .
The show 's symbol is a woman riding on a snail , not your usual metaphor for speed and agility .
But the sponsors have an explanation : `` Through the character associated with a snail , '' they say , `` important values such as harmony with nature and aspirations for the future are sought . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> auto makers are known for coming up with funny names , but <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> the practice seems to have reached a new high -- or low .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda</ENAMEX> has a tiny motorcycle called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Monkey</ENAMEX> , and a slightly larger cousin , the Gorilla .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> has a futuristic delivery truck called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Guppy</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mazda</ENAMEX> has the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bongo</ENAMEX> truck and , under its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Autozam</ENAMEX> nameplate , a `` microvan '' called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scrum</ENAMEX> .
Its buglike <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Carol</ENAMEX> minicar is `` designed with softness , gentleness and warmheartedness . ''
But the court jester appears to be <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's smallest car maker , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daihatsu Motor Co</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of its futuristic concepts is the bubblelike <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sneaker</ENAMEX> , which seats just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> person in front and could hold a small child and bag of groceries in the rear .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Daihatsu</ENAMEX> also has <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the Fellow 90</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the Leeza Spider</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the Hijet Dumbo</ENAMEX> .
The jokes are n't just on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> , though .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Regie Nationale des Usines Renault</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> auto maker , has a concept car called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Megane</ENAMEX> .
The name is supposed to connote feminine grandeur , but in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> it means `` eyeglasses . ''
Foreign Presence
Foreign auto makers are taking <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Tokyo Motor Show</ENAMEX> more seriously than ever .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AB Volvo</ENAMEX> invites passers - by to play `` the role of the test dummy '' by hopping in a car that simulates a crash to show just how its seat - belt tightener works .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hyundai Motor Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> has its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> - ever exhibit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> is sponsoring its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> independent display in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</ENAMEX> , and it includes a boxy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Buick</ENAMEX> station wagon with wood - grain side panels .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler</ENAMEX> also have exhibits , although theirs are tucked in a separate room with the less - popular automotive parts section .
`` We 've got to get out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> mentality and be part of the world mentality , '' declares <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles M. Jordan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> 's vice president for design , in explaining his pilgrimage to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Tokyo Show</ENAMEX> .
Even so , traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> cockiness is n't terribly endangered .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> officials , for example , crowed about their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> - ever <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tokyo Grand Prix</ENAMEX> racing victory .
True , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> was declared the winner <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> , but only after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda</ENAMEX> driver who crossed the finish line <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> was disqualified because it hit another car and skid momentarily out of bounds .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , still criticizes <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> styling .
`` It 's hard for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> , '' he says , `` to get a feeling in a car , to get a passion in a car , to get emotion in a car .
