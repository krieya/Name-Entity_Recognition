As a woman who sees herself as belonging to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">conservative</ENAMEX> society , I have lived for many years of my life in ignorance of this world ...
My knowledge about male interests and their level of thinking and thought was limited to " what I saw " from my male relatives ... a small number I compared a whole world to ...
I began to read and think ... and found that the circle was wider than I had thought ...
My reading broadened ... and as it did , so did my wonder !
The relationship between men and women has never , in my opinion , been one of conflict ... also in comparison to my little world .
We might have a few lighthearted clashes ...
But I never thought there would be people on this earth who would embrace these ideas as belief !
I have read a lot about the marginalization of women ... their degradation ... their undervaluing ... by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> and foreigners ... by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> and disbelievers ... by the ancients and contemporary people .
Such talk would be met with anger and counter-attacks by some women ... by evasion and disregard by some ... and submission and defeat by others .
I have read a lot of proverbs that belittle women ...
But I have never read a proverb by a woman making fun of men ... how sensible women are ! :-LRB-
What is even nicer is that I did not find an offensive proverb about women by people whose intellect , knowledge , ideas and religion I value !
And if something like that came out of one of them at some moment ... they would quickly express regret and apologize !
We have lived for many years hearing , seeing and reading comparisons between men and women ...
It has come to be a received fact for some ...
Others dare to act upon some legal proofs to confirm men 's superiority over women in every aspect ... without exception ! Until we almost started to believe this .
This was how it was years ago ... until the worldwide web -LRB- internet -RRB- came !
I have navigated the depths of this sea for seven years .
And I still do ... dropping my anchor one day and raising it another . Facing clear , calm days ... and facing storms and hurricanes .
