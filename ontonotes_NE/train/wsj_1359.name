<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ENAMEX> said it will start enforcing stiffer regulations <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 31</ENAMEX> for so - called gray - market imports of vehicles .
The regulations , required under legislation enacted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , will apply to imports of vehicles that were n't built to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government auto safety standards and were intended for use in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> or elsewhere abroad .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials estimated that gray - market imports total <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,100</ENAMEX> units a year , a small part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three million</ENAMEX> vehicles exported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</ENAMEX> .
According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NHTSA</ENAMEX> , the new regulations will prohibit anyone other than an importer that has registered with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government , or a person who has a contract with a registered importer , from permanently importing a vehicle that does n't meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto safety standards .
The registered importer would be required to bring such vehicles into compliance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> safety standards , compared with the current situation in which anyone can bring in such vehicles and modify them to meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> standards .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> tightened auto safety standards for gray - market imports after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto dealers , including franchised foreign - car dealers , complained that they often were blamed when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> buyers of such vehicles found that the cars could n't meet <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto safety standards .
