From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> news in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> this is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Meet the Press</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Russert</ENAMEX> /.
Our issues <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this Sunday</ENAMEX> the war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> tensions with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> and the future of this woman our guest the Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Condoleezza Rice</ENAMEX> /.
Then will there be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> staff shake - up /?
And what is at stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two thousand six</ENAMEX> midterm elections /?
Insight and analysis from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Broder</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Washington Post</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elisabeth Bumiller White</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> correspondent for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Times</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Cook</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Journal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Harwood</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNBC</ENAMEX> /.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> as we begin <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth year</ENAMEX> of the war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> we are joined by the Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> /.
Welcome back Madame Secretary /.
Good morning /.
nice to be with you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> /.
Very disturbing headlines in the papers <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> helping <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
and this is how it was captured in the paper /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> officials collected intelligence on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> troop movements and attack plans from inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> military command leading the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two thousand and three</ENAMEX> invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and passed that information on to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> military study /.
The intelligence report which the study said were provided to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> ambassador in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> during the height of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> assault warned accurately that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> formations intended to bypass <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> cities on their thrust towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> /.
The reports provided some specific numbers on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> troop units ' locations according to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> documents dated <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April oh three</ENAMEX> and later captured by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> /.
Have you told the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> what is going on /?
Well we 're trying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> to m- make sure we understand fully what the documents say /.
Uh these are documents that were found uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> stores /.
and obviously <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> we would take very seriously uh any suggestion that uh this may have been done uh maybe to the detriment of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> forces /.
And so uh we will certainly raise it with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> government /.
We want to uh take a real hard look at the documents and then raise it with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> government /.
But these are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> documents a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> report /.
Y- yes /.
You believe the report /.
Oh I I certainly think there is uh a lot to this report /.
but we really have n't a cha- had a chance to look at the documents in uh detail /.
Intend to do that and then to raise it with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> government /.
I would hope the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> government will take it seriously /.
Will there be an investigation as to who leaked the information to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> /?
Well I we 'll just have to see /.
I d- I do n't want to get ahead of us /.
but obviously we take very seriously uh any suggestion that uh this may have been done at the beginning of the war /.
That would be a quite serious charge /.
Was it -- could it have been deliberate misinformation /?
I do n't know /.
I think we really have to take a look at the documents /.
We 're finding <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands and thousands and thousands</ENAMEX> of documents /.
And uh we 're going to find some uh i- i- -- some important and uh surprising things in these documents /.
I think we have to step back take a hard look at the documents /.
but I definitely -- we will raise it with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> government /.
When we <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> went into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> we had some unexpected encounters with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Fedayeen</ENAMEX> /.
and we lost uh <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> men that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> may have been responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> deaths /.
Well I do n't want to try hypothetically to to know what impact this might have had /.
I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> thing we need to do is take a good hard look at the documents /.
and then we definitely want to raise it with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> government /.
And again I would hope that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> government would uh would take it seriously and and give us a serious answer on what they find /.
Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June of two thousand one</ENAMEX> the president said he looked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Putin</ENAMEX> in the eye /.
He got a sense of his soul found him to be very straightforward and very trustworthy /.
Does the president still believe that President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> is straightforward and trustworthy /?
I really do think that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> have generally done what they said they would do /.
They said they were going to oppose <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Iraq War</ENAMEX> and they did /.
and they told us that from the very beginning /.
Uh so I do n't have an argument there /.
and I do n't want to jump to the conclusion that this was something that was ordered out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kremlin</ENAMEX> /.
We have to look at the documents /.
We have to go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> government /.
but I would hope that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> government would take seriously uh any suggestion uh that they may have passed uh data to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> uh at the advent of the war /.
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> ambassador is the source /.
How could <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> not have known /.
and how could it be straightforward and honest for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> /?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> we have to get to the bottom of the facts of this /.
We will most certainly raise it with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> government /.
I I 've said several times it 's a serious matter /.
but uh I do n't want to jump out ahead and start making accusations about what uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> may or may not have known /.
This is something in a relationship that we have with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> that really is candid and where we do talk about difficult things all the time , where I think we 'll be able to talk about this and talk about it uh honestly /.
Why wo n't the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> help us get sanctions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> and try to stop them from developing nuclear weapons /?
Well we 're not yet at the stage where we 're seeking sanctions /.
Uh what we 're doing now is uh we 're seeking a presidential statement that would make clear to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> the international community 's determination that it live up to the obligations that everyone thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> has /.
We 're working through it /.
Uh we have a s- -- the same strategy here /.
We have the same uh view of the problem /.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> do not want a nuclear rec- weapon in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> either /.
It 's been very clear in everything that they have tried to do in the way that they set up the civil nuclear cooporation with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bushehr</ENAMEX> in what they offered the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> also do not believe that there should be enrichment and reprocessing capability on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> soil /.
And uh enrichment and reprocessing capability is the core here /.
If you 're able to enrich and reprocess then the ability to build a bomb is is there /.
And so we and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> and certainly the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Europeans</ENAMEX> have the same view of what is -- what is to be prevented /.
Uh yes we 've had some tactical differences on how to get there /.
but uh I talked with my <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> counterpart uh on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> /.
We agreed that our people would go back and work very hard <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</ENAMEX> and we 'll see where we are on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> /.
Um we 're considering whether it might be a good idea to get um after we have a presidential statement uh get ministers together again uh with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the P five</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the permanent five</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Security Council</ENAMEX> plus <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> uh to talk about charting a course forward because everybody takes very seriously <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> 's intransigence and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> 's unwillingness uh to do what the international community is bid- -- is uh determined that it will do /.
It is the policy of our government that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> will not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon /.
I- i- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> can not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon /.
That is the view of the international community not just the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> /.
This article is in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Times</ENAMEX> /.
The reality is that most of us think the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> are probably going to get a weapon or the technology to make one sooner or later an administration official acknowledged <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks ago</ENAMEX> refusing to talk on the record because such an admission amounts to a concession that dragging <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> in front of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations Security Council</ENAMEX> may prove an exercise in futility /.
The optomists around here about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> just hope we can delay the day by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten or twenty years</ENAMEX> and that by that time we 'll have a different relationship with a different <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> government /.
That seems like a much different policy /.
Well I since I do n't know who this anonymous person is I ca n't tell you what uh w- what relationship they may have to the policy /.
I 'll tell you who does n't think that /.
I do n't believe uh that /.
I do n't believe that the President believes that because we 're doing everything that we can to uh send a strong signal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> that they have no choice /.
If they wish to be a part of the international community they have no choice but to give up ambitions that could lead to the technologies that would lead to a nuclear weapon /.
Uh if the international community stays really solid here <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> can not stand the kind of isolation from the international community that for instance <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> endures almost by choice /.
We really do have a chance to solve this diplomatically /.
but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> I would be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> to say we ca n't afford to waste time /.
That 's why we need our our people in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> to really work toward this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> phase /.
We need to see if that has a an effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> /.
and if it does not have an effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> we need to move to the next phase /.
Which is /?
The next phase is uh to look to uh further uh options in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Security Council</ENAMEX> /.
For instance perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the chapter seven resolution</ENAMEX> /.
Which is /?
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter seven resolution</ENAMEX> essentially gives uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Security Council</ENAMEX> the ability to compel a state to act /.
Uh it i- can um say that there would be consequences if actions are not taken /.
Including military /?
Well uh no one ever takes anything off the table /.
but I believe we 're a long way from uh from that /.
We have the possibilities of financial measures that could be taken uh bans against travel /.
There are -- there are a lot of uh options once you 're in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Security Council</ENAMEX> /.
That 's why it was very important to get this uh dossier <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> dossier to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Security Council</ENAMEX> and why the diplomacy that we 've been working over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last uh couple of years</ENAMEX> to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Europeans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> on the same page and to now bring the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> along uh has been so important /.
D- do you believe if the President chose to embark on military action with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> he would go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> for authorization <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> /?
I 'm not going to speculate on that /.
The president uh v- is uh v- clear that he keeps all of his options on the table /.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> I think speculating about how we might uh set up military action is n't helpful at a time when we really are concentrating on the diplomacy /.
But I want to be very clear /.
But you would n't go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> /?
Well eh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> of course the uh administration went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> uh the last time /.
And I would just uh ask people to look at the history of how this president has uh has acted /.
He has uh taken <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> as a full partner in these matters /.
but I 'm not going to get into a discussion of what the President may or may not do uh constitutionally /.
Let me turn back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
The war now in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">its fourth year</ENAMEX> /.
and these are the grim statistics /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> troops killed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thousand three hundred and sixteen</ENAMEX> . Wounded injured <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seventeen thousand two hundred seventy - one</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> killed an estimate num- estimated number is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thirty thousand</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundred and thirty thousand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> troops on the ground /.
When you were planning the war some <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three and a half years ago</ENAMEX> did you have any idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> into the war those are the numbers that you would be confronting /?
Well I certainly thought that it would be difficult /.
Um I do n't think anyone um knew precisely what we would be facing in terms of numbers /.
And look /.
every one of those deaths is uh mourned by people in the administration uh because these are families that have lost um husbands and wives and daughters and sons /.
Um but we also know that nothing of value is ever won without sacrifice /.
We 're in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> because the um <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States of America</ENAMEX> faces a different kind of enemy and a different kind of war /.
And we have to have a different kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> if we 're ever going to resolve the uh the the problems of an ideology of hatred that was so great that people flew airplanes into buildings /.
Iraq was a -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> was a threat /.
Now that the /-
B- but but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> was not related to flying airplanes into buildings /.
No /.
and we have never said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> /-
u- uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> was not related to the events of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">September eleventh</ENAMEX> /.
But if you really believe that the only thing that happened on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">September eleventh</ENAMEX> was people flew airplanes into buildings I think you have a very narrow view of what we faced on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">September eleventh</ENAMEX> /.
We faced the um the outcome of an ideology of hatred throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> that had to be dealt with /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> was a part of that old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> /.
The new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> will be a part of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> /.
and we will all be safer /.
But Madame Secretary weapons of mass destruction was the primary rationale given to go into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Myers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> news broke a story <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> foreign minister Mister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sabri</ENAMEX> w- became a spy for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> and and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> /.
And this is how it was reported /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein 's</ENAMEX> last foreign minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naji Sabri</ENAMEX> paid spy for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="1">+French</ENAMEX> intelligence later turned him over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> to supply information about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> its chemical biological nuclear weapon program <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than six months</ENAMEX> before the war began in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March of oh three</ENAMEX> according {to} former intelligence officials /.
The sources said he provided information {the?} <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> dictator had ambitions for a nuclear program but it was not active and that no biological weapons were being produced or stockpiled although research was under way /.
That 's a far cry from what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> people were told /.
Of course <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> this was a single source among multiple sources /.
And the problem was that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> was unwilling after multiple revel- resolutions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Security Council</ENAMEX> to account for his uh weapons programs /.
Uh we all remember that the accounting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> mission that was suppo- uh weapons inspection mission that was supposed to uh look into its weapons program could not account for large stockpiles /.
We all thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> had weapons of mass destruction /.
He certainly had a a very healthy appetite for them /.
and he had used them before both against his own people and against his neighbors /.
He was a threat /.
This was someone flying uh against our aircraft or or i- shooting at our aircraft as they flew the no - fly zone /.
He 'd invaded his neighbors /.
But the point is that now that he 's gone <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> has an opportunity to be a different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> in a different kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> /.
I know it 's hard /.
And I know that the numbers that you 've put up are difficult to see /.
And I know that the violence on TV is difficult /.
But I would ask people to uh to look at the perspective here of what is really going on in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
Under this -- uh the violence under the specter of this violence you have <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> now <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunni</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kurds</ENAMEX> and others determined to form a government of national unity /.
That 's extraordinary in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> 's history where they 've always settled their differences by violence not by politics /.
And when they succeed in that you uh they are going to have the basis for a very uh different kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
and I think they 're going to succeed /.
But people are being asked to take your judgement on this as we sit here this morning and refer to previous judgements the administration made /.
Weapons of mass destruction there were none /.
We would be greeted as liberators /.
this is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years later</ENAMEX> /.
That th- it would not take <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> troops to occupy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Franks</ENAMEX> according to the book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cobra Two</ENAMEX> said we 'd be down to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thirty thousand</ENAMEX> troops in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November of oh three</ENAMEX> /.
The cost of the war the budget director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> said it 'd be <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">fifty billion dollars</ENAMEX> /.
It 's now over <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">three hundred and fifty billion dollars</ENAMEX> /.
Each judgement has proven to be wrong /.
The judgement that has not proven to be wrong uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> is that the region is changing in fundemental ways and the region is better without <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> /.
Yes it is true that uh everyone thought he had weapons of mass destruction /.
He did not /.
It is by the way the case that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> are delighted to be rid of him /.
And some Iraqis uh most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> in fact uh are willing and uh want to keep coalition forces there until they can uh take care of this themselves /.
But we do have to keep things in historical perspective /.
These people are doing something that is quite unknown in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> /.
and one has to ask what was the alternative /?
Was the alternative to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> in power uh continuing to threaten his neighbors continuing with his uh windfall profits from the oil for food scandal continuing to repress uh his people and build mass graves uh continuing to uh use those oil for food profits to again build the infrastructure for his weapons of mass destruction /?
But many will say he was contained by the no - fly zone /.
Ah I do n't think that there is anyone -- I I do not think that he was in a box /.
He was in a box /.
It i- the oil for food program alone shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">the billions of dollars</ENAMEX> that he was collecting /-
He was not just going to build palaces /.
This was someone who had an insatiable appetite uh to dominate his region /.
Now without <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> you can look across the region and see that uh a lot is changing thanks to the President 's democracy uh promotion and the hard work of people in those countries /.
You have <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Syrian</ENAMEX> forces out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> /.
You have uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> out of uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
The people of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> are taking on authoritarian governments across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> has given women the right to vote /.
I 'd be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> to say that these big historical changes are turbulent and they 're difficult /.
But the notion that somehow there was a placid <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> , that if we just left it alone , if we 'd just not invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , if we had just not overthrown dictators , if we {had?} just not challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Syrian</ENAMEX> power in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> everything would be just fine uh is simply not true /.
It was <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">that Middle East</ENAMEX> the malignancy of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> that we quote unquote disturbed that led directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the September eleventh event</ENAMEX> /.
The President said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> that whether there 'll be troops in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> for the f- unforeseeable future will be determined by the next president meaning we 're going to have troops in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> at least through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January of oh nine</ENAMEX> /.
Oh the President was asked this question in a particular way /.
and he e- answered that uh some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> troops may well be there for the next president /.
But I would just point to what uh the President has said continually which is that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> forces are going to come down uh commensurate with the need as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> forces stand up /.
and they are indeed standing up /.
General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casey</ENAMEX> has talked about a significant reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> forces over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next year</ENAMEX> /.
and that significant reduction is because <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> forces are taking and holding territory now because during this most recent uptick of sectarian violence the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> army uh uh behaved very very well /.
So <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> forces are getting better /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> forces are ceding territory /.
and I think it 's entirely uh probable that we will see a significant draw - down of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> forces over the next uh <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> /.
That 's what General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casey</ENAMEX> believes /.
Was /-
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> /.
It 's all dependent on the ground but this i- on on events on the ground /.
but as General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casey</ENAMEX> has said we see the progress with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> forces /.
We see the progress of the political process /.
And uh there 's every reason to believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> forces can start to draw down /.
Is the insurgency in its last throes /?
Well the insurgency uh politicially is certainly in in danger because {of?} the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> who stood outside of the political process /.
But in terms of violence is it in its last throes /?
Well i- the insurgency is still able to uh to pull off violence and kill innocent children or kill an innocent school teacher /.
Yes they are able to do that /.
and they might be able to do that some ti- for some time /.
But what they 've not been able to do is to disrupt the political process /.
What they 've not been able to do is to set <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> uh one against another in the political process /.
They 've not been able to stop three elections /.
They 're not able to stop formation of uh the government /.
Uh a few violent people can always uh grab headlines and can always kill innocent people /.
It 's more than a few /.
Well it 's a few in terms of the population of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> /.
But it could not exist without being enabled by the population /.
Well the population is less and less enabling every day /.
There are reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zarqawi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al - Qaeda</ENAMEX> meet stiff resistance indeed violent resistance from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> tribes /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunnis</ENAMEX> are now a part of the political process /.
And I know that people wonder when will the government formation finish /.
Uh it it seems to be dragging on after the election /.
But I would just note I read the other day someone said well they 're dividing up the spoils of the offices /.
That 's not what they 're doing in this process /.
They are writing a government program on which the national unity will govern /.
They are writing the rules by which they will govern /.
And they 're defi- -- they 're trying to determining who will take key positions /.
So this is uh an extraordinary matter an extraordinary scene with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunni</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kurds</ENAMEX> all working together toward a unity government /.
Let me turn to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> /.
There 's a story moving on the wires that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghan</ENAMEX> court has just dismissed the charges against this gentleman who had converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christianity</ENAMEX> /.
Are you aware that was going to happen /?
I I ca n't confirm uh that particular report uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> /.
I know that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghans</ENAMEX> are working on it /.
They 've been very aware um of the issue and of the concerns about the issue /.
This is a young democracy that is uh working with a constitution that uh like many constitutions when they 're <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> born uh e- th- the conflicts have to be worked out /.
W- we have our own history of conflicts that had to be worked out after a new constitution /.
And so um the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghans</ENAMEX> are working working on it /.
but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> has stood solidly for religious freedom uh as a a a bedrock the bedrock of uh of uh democracy /.
and um we 'll see /.
but I ca n't confirm that specifically /.
Should <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christian</ENAMEX> missionaries be encouraged to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> /?
Well I think that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghans</ENAMEX> are uh pleased to get uh the help that they can get /.
We need to be respectful of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghan</ENAMEX> sovereignty /.
Including <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christian</ENAMEX> missionaries /.
We have to be respectful of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghan</ENAMEX> sovereignty and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> respectful of the fact that this is a country that is coming out of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty - five years</ENAMEX> of civil war a country that 's going to have to find its own way and a country that is going through <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the most difficult uh debates that any society goes through /.
and that is the proper role of religion in uh the politics of the state /.
It 's a debate by the way that all of us went through at some point in our history /.
But Madame Secretary we talk all the time about spreading democracy /.
and your own state department report on human rights abuses said Afghanistan ha- -- eh says that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Christianity</ENAMEX> is punishable by death that a missionaries <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christian</ENAMEX> missionaries are not welcome that women can not get a a passport or leave the country without permission of a man /.
This is a far cry from the responsibilities and rights given to most people who live in a democracy /.
I- it 's also a far cry from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> /.
This is a country that has come an enormous way in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> where yes the uh issues of the constitution are going to be debated in this very traditional society that is trying now to move to a modern political system /.
I would just ask people to remember how hard this was for us /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> I am I hate to say <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty one years</ENAMEX> old /.
but it 's in my lifetime that uh black <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> were guaranteed the right to vote /.
Who are we to be uh so uh eh so insistent that people must do this overnight /?
We 're d- working with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghan</ENAMEX> government /.
They 're moving in a democratic fashion /.
It 's going to be hard /.
But when something arises uh as with Mister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rahman</ENAMEX> it is the obligation of the international community and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> and there has been support across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> for this that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghans</ENAMEX> be reminded that in their own constitution they have enshrined the universal declaration on human rights which guarantees certain religious freedoms /.
We did n't have that constitution with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> to work with /.
So <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christians</ENAMEX> should be able to worship /?
People should be able to convert to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christianity</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> /.
O- of course <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> /.
That our eh the universal declaration of human rights is is clear on this /.
but I would have to say that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghans</ENAMEX> are going to have to work through some of the difficulties and contradictions /.
But it ca n't be done on a case by case business /.
It has to be ensured /.
They will have to work through court cases as we have to interpret the +constitution /.
They will have to work through individual cases /.
And I 'm quite certain that the evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghan</ENAMEX> democracy is going in the right direction /.
But I would just remind people that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years ago</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> was executing people wantonly in uh stadiums for playing music /.
This is a country that has come a very very long way /.
and women were not being educated uh at all /.
It was punishable to educate women /.
This is a place that has come a long long way /.
Let 's support them in uh their quest to become a a modern democracy /.
You mentioned you 're <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty one</ENAMEX> /.
and I 'm curious if it 's time for a career change /.
We 've discussed uh uh future options for you on this program /.
Here was the headline all across the paper /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NFL</ENAMEX> commisioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Tagliabue</ENAMEX> step down in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> /.
and here 's our conversations in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two thousand one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> on this subject /.
In your next life you want to be commisioner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NFL</ENAMEX> /?
Right /.
I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NFL</ENAMEX> is really a terrific institution /.
and I 'd love to be associated with it <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> day /.
Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> /?
Uh I- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> I 'm going off to be commisioner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NFL</ENAMEX> /.
remember /?
I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Tagliabue</ENAMEX> 's doing a fine job as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NFL</ENAMEX> commisioner /.
but um I look forward to uh the day that he decides to retire /.
and uh I I very much think that the the best job in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's got to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NFL</ENAMEX> commisioner /.
You just announced your candidacy /.
I I still think the best job in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> may be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NFL</ENAMEX> commisioner /.
It 's a little too soon for me /.
I 've got lots to do as Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> /.
and I I think my ship came in /.
It 's going to have to leave the port without me /.
So you 're not interested /?
No not interested /.
Now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Barns</ENAMEX> a reporter uh uh has close t- ties to the eh sources to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> wrote this in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</ENAMEX> /.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> the president 's most spectacular move would be to annoint a presidential successor /.
This would require Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> to resign /.
His replacement /?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Condoleezza Rice</ENAMEX> who Mister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> regards highly /.
We 've got a great vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> in uh Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> /.
Uh he is uh doing a fantastic job for the president and uh for the country /.
Um he is really <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the strongest uh supporters th- that uh I 've drawn on from time to time /.
and uh he 's doing a great job /.
I think I 'd better try to be Secretary of St- /-
You just gave a whole list of things I have to work on as Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> /.
But if the President c- -- if the President came to you and said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney</ENAMEX> 's going to resign I want you to be my vice president because I want you to run in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two thousand eight</ENAMEX> you would n't say no /.
I- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> ah I think we 've been through this conversation about <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two thousand and eight</ENAMEX> /.
Not not going to t- -- I 'm not going to do that /.
That 's not what I want to do with my life /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Bush</ENAMEX> said you 'd make an excellent president and I do n't think we can talk her into running /.
Uh well that 's is -- I really appreciate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> lady who I admire very much uh thinks that /.
but the last part of that 's right /.
Will not happen /.
I do n't think it 's going to happen /.
Madame Secretary as always we thank you for shar- sharing your views /.
Thank you very much /.
Coming next , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Broder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elisabeth Bumiller</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Cook</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Harwood</ENAMEX> interpret the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> political landscape tackle the issue of immigration and look at the midterm elections in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two thousand six</ENAMEX> /.
Right here on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Meet the Press</ENAMEX> /.
The politics of immigration Iraq and the midterm congressional elections /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Broder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elisabeth Bumiller</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Cook</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Harwood</ENAMEX> a round table after this station break /.
And we are back /.
Welcome all /.
Immigration /.
Look at these scenes and these pictures from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five hundred thousand</ENAMEX> people according to police estimates turned out to protest some of the immigration reforms that are being discussed debated perhaps legislated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Broder</ENAMEX> how big of a political issue is immigration /.
and what are the potential pitfalls for politicians as they try to navigate the issue /?
It started as a border issue in uh states that have common boundaries with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> particularly /.
Uh it has now become a national issue /.
Talking to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> Governor of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> it 's a big issue in his state /.
Suburban t- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> districts now find large <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hispanic</ENAMEX> populations /.
It has become a much tougher issue for politicians of both parties but particularly I think for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> /.
The polling we have seen with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">eighty - eight percent</ENAMEX> say it 's a serious problem /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">sixty - two percent</ENAMEX> say that illegal illegal immigrants should not be allowed to become citizens /.
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">sixty percent</ENAMEX> say that we should n't even give them guest worker status to come here temporarily /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elisabeth Bumiller</ENAMEX> you wrote a piece in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Times</ENAMEX> quote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is facing a difficult path on immigration talking about the joint pressures on President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> from the business community we need these people to work because <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> wo n't do the jobs and the conservative community saying i- illegal immigrants get them out /.
What does he do /?
He 's trying to uh thread the needle and walk a very fine line between both of these groups /.
I mean inches he 's a you know a governor of -- he 's a former governor of a border state /.
so he this is very close to his political experience /.
Emotionally he is i- -- in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early days</ENAMEX> of this debate in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two thousand four</ENAMEX> he was giving very emotional speeches about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> the land of immigrants /.
and he was proposing this this very what many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> said was a very generous guest worker program /.
Um he has pulled back a lot now ah under under onslaught from from conservatives /.
and now he 's emphasizing the border security part of his plan /.
He 's trying to do both /.
There 's a lot -- as we know there 's a lot of different proposals on the hill right now /.
We 'll see some of them <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> /.
Um <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> is hanging back waiting to see what what comes out of th- -- out of the smoke /.
and then we 'll -- we 'll weigh in /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Cook</ENAMEX> it appears that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> people have very firm views about immigration and that the President and other politicians are kind of trying to nuance the issue /.
Is that possible /?
Well it 's a funny issue /.
If you ask me what 's the most important problem facing the country it 's a small single digit issue /.
but then once you raise it boy emotions run high /.
and it 's hard to split the baby /.
And and I can see where the president 's trying to go the let 's build build a wall or build a barrier stop illegal immigration /.
But for the people we have we got to mainstream them and keep this workforce going because that 's important for agribusiness and business /.
Is that politically acceptable to conservatives /?
Eh it 's not acceptable to anybody /.
but it 's the only way I think /-
I mean they 're going to have to figure out a way to split the baby because one way or the other is is is is just not going to work /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> /?
Well let 's do n't forget <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> are also split on this issue /.
Lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">African - Americans</ENAMEX> are not very sympathetic with the cause of the guest worker program /.
Uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> one of the ways <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elisabeth</ENAMEX> mentioned trying to thread the needle one of the things they were looking at is trying to push the final resolution of this until after the midterm election /.
That also could happen on some budget issues as well as a way of trying to make some sort of common cause between moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> and moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> /.
You know in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two thousand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two thousand four</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> /.
You look at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two thousand eight</ENAMEX> that electoral college map /.
and you look at states like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> some real potential swing states /.
And this issue could be very decisive as we play it through /.
Well let 's do- do n't forget <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> other thing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> /.
This was raised in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> governor 's race <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">republican</ENAMEX> candidate who went after some of these job centers that attract illegal immigrants /.
Did n't work for him /.
so sometimes the emotion of the issue does n't always prevail /.
Let me turn to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> the big discussion in our country about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> the way the issue is being covered by the media /.
Uh Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Sunday</ENAMEX> made these comments /.
There 's a constant sort of perception if you will that is created because what 's newsworthy is the car bomb in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> it 's not all the work that went on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</ENAMEX> other provinces in terms of making progress towards rebuilding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
Secretary of Defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> weighed in /.
The terrorists seem to recognize that they 're losing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
I believe that history will show that to be the case /.
Fortunately history is not made up of daily headlines blogs on the websites or the latest sensational attack /.
And then <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this Wednesday</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> went to a town meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> of his supporters /.
and here 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the questions that was asked /.
And I ask you this from the bottom of my heart for a solution to this because it seems that our major media networks do n't want to portray the good . They just want to focus /-
Okay hold on <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a second</ENAMEX> /.
They just want to focus on another car bomb /.
or they just want to focus on some more bloodshed /.
Does that issue work that th- it 's the mainstream media that 's distorting the good news that 's coming out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /?
I think it helps with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">republican</ENAMEX> base /.
but I do n't think it helps with swing voters at all /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> of all it 's the nature of news /.
I mean on the evening news at night a car that is n't in a wreck is n't in the news /.
A house that does n't burn a building that does n't burn a killing that does n't take place /.
News is when -- is the aberration is the change from normalcy /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</ENAMEX> this uh <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty</ENAMEX> journalists so far have been killed over there /.
Um I mean it 's -- it 's -- it 's -- I mean getting out there and looking around wandering around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> looking for good news sounds to me like a good way to get killed /.
And then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> thing is that I I do n't know if they really want to try to sell this because people do n't think that that uh that everything 's fine /.
I mea- I think this is just an extenuation of holding the banner that says mission accomplished /.
The people do n't think it 's well /.
They can see that it 's not going well /.
And what happens in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</ENAMEX> provinces does n't matter /.
What if they think that this thing is just really going to hell in a handbasket um it 's ki- -- I mean that 's what -- you know that 's that /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Broder /?</ENAMEX>
The ombudsman at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Post</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah Howell</ENAMEX> has a very thoughtful analysis of this question in the paper <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> which I would refer people to /.
I think the answer is that when there is this level of violence and turmoil in a country that has to be the heart of the story that the press is is telling /.
The other parts of it do get told /.
but they do not dominate the news /.
and they ca n't dominate the news given the realities of that country /.
Nor should they dominate the news /.
It 's a very weak argument /.
When when you have as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX> said journalists over there who can not move around the country to report because they know that that they 're in danger of being killed at any moment that tells you about the state of security in the country /.
It 's not good /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The White House /?</ENAMEX>
Y- the other thing that 's interesting what you did n't show was the President 's response to her /.
I was there <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</ENAMEX> /.
and he was very very careful not to jump on her bandwagon /.
In fact uh I mean obviously he did n't have to /.
She did it for him /.
but the point is he said look , wait <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a minute</ENAMEX> /.
You know um I understand your frustration /.
but um we have a free press in this country /.
We ca n't tell them what to do /.
He pulled back somewhat from her comment /.
and I think you 're right <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX> that they are n't -- they know they ca n't sell this and when they 've tried in the past it has backfired on them /.
But the President also said do n't be afraid to go to blogs and find out some more information /.
Yes I mean s- I mean I 'm d- -- I 'm -- these are gradations here in Wh- -- in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> response /.
But is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> convinced that in order to secure the base of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republican Party</ENAMEX> for the President it does n't hurt to go after the media a little bit /?
Not n- of course not /.
They do it all the time /.
And uh and they complain all the time about about about what we do /.
But but I I have noticed this past week <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott McClellan</ENAMEX> saying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> Press Secretary you know we 're not blaming the media for the war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
He said that a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">couple</ENAMEX> times <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> /.
And so so it 's -- i- they 're -- they 're -- again they 're being a little more careful here than usual /.
And did you really fall asleep in that press pool /.
or was that a cheap shot by the President /?
That 's completely inaccurate /.
I wo n't say I have n't nodded off in previous speeches but not that one /.
There is a difference +between -- difference +between meditation and sleep /.
The uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Broder</ENAMEX> let me turn to the the rebellion that I sense with some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> members uh particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republican Party</ENAMEX> when you go talk to them privately /.
You captured it in your column this way /.
The conflict over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Dubai Ports World</ENAMEX> brought to the surface deep - seated resentments from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capitol</ENAMEX> end of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pennsylvania Avenue</ENAMEX> toward the people around the President and surprisingly toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> himself /.
The harmony that had prevailed during most of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's tenure the deference that a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> has generally shown to his wishes disappeared /.
Even the normal circumspection with which congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> treat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> withered in the heat of this dispute /.
And then this /.
Congressman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Davis</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> a committee chairman told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Post</ENAMEX> this is probably the worst administration ever in getting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> ' opinion on anything /.
Ouch /.
Well you had heard this kind of comment all of us had privately from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> on the hill /.
But the fact that somebody like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Davis</ENAMEX> former chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee</ENAMEX> is saying it publicly on the record s- uh gives you a measure of the sort of fall - off of any sense of either loyalty or intimidation whatever you want to call it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> /.
Uh they uh feel that they 're on their own and that the President is going to take care of his business but they 're going to take care of their own /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of the things being talked about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elisabeth Bumiller</ENAMEX> is the staff shake - up at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> /.
This is how you reported it /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> say that had pushed Mister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> uh not to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Rove</ENAMEX> the chief uh political operator Deputy uh Chief of Staff but rather to bring in someone at the same level or above perhaps as minister without portfolio /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> said Mister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> should view it as replacing a top - notch pitcher struggling in the later innings of a baseball game rather than as a vote of no - confidence in a friend /.
So who 's the reliever /?
Well there 's lots of names that they /-
You 've heard them as well as I have /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Gillespie</ENAMEX> uh you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Paxon</ENAMEX> /.
there 's lots of names /.
Um the question is are they going to do it /.
and and right now there 's -- there 's a lot of talk at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> /.
There 's no indication that the President has signed on to this idea /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Rove</ENAMEX> has told people that he thinks that bringing somebody in without a clear line of authority is a mistake /.
It and and uh th- the bottom line is what is this going to d- -- is this going to help with the war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /?
It 's going to help with -- you know tha- that 's -- it 's -- is it goi- -- you know we 're n- -- we 're not talking about changing policies here /.
we 're changing about -- you know changing you know some some personnel /.
so i- that 's /-
it 's unclear if anything 's going to happen /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> /?
Well chances are pretty good something will happen /.
The President of course did n't rule out the idea of bringing someone on /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Paxon</ENAMEX> 's a possibility /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vin Weber</ENAMEX> 's also a possibility /.
And I think over time you could see some changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> staff as well /.
When you look at sort of the the big three or or th- the biggest names in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Card</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Rove</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Bartlett</ENAMEX> you could see some change over time /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Card</ENAMEX> probably the most likely to leave at some point /.
He 's almost uh already the longest serving Chief of Staff ever /.
You could see some change there /.
On on the verge of dethroning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman Adams</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dwight Eisenhower</ENAMEX> fame /.
You bet /.
Uh let me turn to the midterm elections where th- all these things +invariably lead /.
Here 's our latest numbers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> poll right track wrong track /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> headed in the right direction <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">twenty - six percent</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Sixty - two percent</ENAMEX> say wrong track /.
and the so called generic question who do you want to control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">thirty - seven percent</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Fifty percent</ENAMEX> now a majority say the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> /.
but as always <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Cook</ENAMEX> is warning of us to go slow /.
And here 's his latest column from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Journal</ENAMEX> /.
Despite national political trends indicating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> is in serious trouble a race by race micro-analysis suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> can not easily seize control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</ENAMEX> /.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> need a net gain of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> seats /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> need to win in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Frist</ENAMEX> is retiring have to run the table by defeating all the most vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> while holding all of their own seats including in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> where their incumbent is retiring and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> state where Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Cantwell</ENAMEX> faces a very strong challenger /.
They also need to hang on to somewhat more secure open seats in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</ENAMEX> other incumbents /.
Although not impossible in a favorable +political political climate this is a very tall order /.
and here are the vulnerable states according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cook</ENAMEX> report /.
Uh vulnerable senators <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conrad Burns</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lincoln Chafee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike DeWine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santorum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Talent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> seat /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX> what do you see in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> /?
This is -- you know when you look at this election from the big picture the national numbers boy just looks horrible /.
and it looks like gosh <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> will be lucky if they hold onto anything /.
And then you do the race by race like this /.
Now the thing is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> probably are n't that hard /.
But when you get to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</ENAMEX> seats you get to to to winning in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> and you wi- -- and an- an- talking about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> open seat /.
Gosh that 's hard /.
I mean it 's going to take a real real real strong wind up their backs /.
And and it 's the kind of thing where there 's structural barriers /.
I mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">eighty - five percent</ENAMEX> of all incumbent senators get reelected /.
And you 've got to knock out <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> of them /?
Now it can happen /.
but it 's hard /.
And it 's kind of like having uh structural barriers that are out there that are protecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> majorities /.
and if this is a category <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> hurricane those barriers are strong enough /.
but if it 's a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> they 're not /.
And the question is how tall it will it be /.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> some of the- -- some of those ranges races can change overnight in a hurry /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conrad Burns</ENAMEX> has now got a primary challenge from a significant <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> /.
There 's some talk among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> that maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conrad Burns</ENAMEX> would find something else to do maybe in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration /.
That could change in a hurry /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX> you also say this about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> /.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> need a net gain of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</ENAMEX> seats only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three dozen</ENAMEX> are truly in play <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> /.
So it 's -- it 's i- tough /.
and you have to get a a a s- a straight an inside straight /.
Right there 're basically <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty - four</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">republican</ENAMEX> seats that today are vulnerable /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> have to win <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty - four</ENAMEX> and hold on to their <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</ENAMEX> most tou- the toughest ones /.
And again they can do it /.
The- there d- i- if if there were more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> retirements in tough districts , if uh /-
But redistricting and the incumbency advantages that have built over the years just make pulling this kind of win hard unless it 's a category <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> /.
Well in in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteen ninety - four</ENAMEX> you talked about micro-changes <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thirty</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thirty - five</ENAMEX> seats in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> /.
and the tsunami came /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> won <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifty - two</ENAMEX> seats uh electing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX> Speaker of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX> has now weighed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Broder</ENAMEX> and said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> ' slogan in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two thousand shits six</ENAMEX> should be had enough /.
And he thinks that would work /.
What a l- helper <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> is /.
Uh I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> ' real slogan may very well be would n't you like to have somebody watching the store because the sense that I get from talking to voters is that they are not ready to entrust the government to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> but they 're not really comfortable th- with the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> have been running things /.
And the simple idea of having a little oversight uh little checks and balances back in the system is potentially a really powerful argument for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elisabeth Bumiller</ENAMEX> when y- re- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> hears little oversight checks and balances to them it means hearings with subpoena power /.
and they do n't like that /.
That 's right /.
No no /.
and you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Rove</ENAMEX> has told people he 's optomistic they can hang on to both Houses um uh if if /-
But he also has said yes it can happen the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Cook</ENAMEX> says /.
And you know you 're going to see the Pre- /-
He 's -- the President 's out a lot <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> campaigning already raising money for candidates /.
and uh he 's out in the all these big states /.
Because the last thing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> wants is investigation into weapons of mass destruction and to prison abuse and to religious rights in Afghanistan /.
Drop drop the issue /.
and there 's a hearing /.
Ri- I mean it 's the last that 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two years</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> presidency then /.
and they know that /.
That 's true <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> /.
but let 's keep in mind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> of all keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> majority is not the top priority for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">this White House</ENAMEX> /.
Winning the war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> is the top priority /.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">secondly</ENAMEX> it might not be the worst thing to happen to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W Bush</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> had a weak majority /.
You could see some deals cut especially on entitlement programs <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two years</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> try to resolve a problem before they hope they get a president in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two thousand nine</ENAMEX> /.
David is it enough for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> to say we 're not the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> period /.
or do they have to come forward with a specific proposal to deal with these problems including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /?
Well if they 're going to be responsible they need some policy /.
And the great void on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> side is nobody can tell you <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> what their policy is about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> about entitlements or about any of the other challenges facing the country /.
Whether they need that politically somebody else is smart enough to decide /.
But if they 're going to be a responsible party they need to talk about policy /.
Do they need to do it /?
See I would argue that minority parties do n't have to be responsible /.
That 's the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> good thing going for them /.
and when they try to be responsible they 're just going to dig themselves into a hole /.
I mean y- you 're on -- y- your job is to throw rocks /.
Once you start offering alternatives then suddenly you 're playing defense as well /.
I think <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> would be crazy from a political standpoint to offer up proposals /.
That c- movie <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cool Hand Luke</ENAMEX> sometimes nothing 's a real cool hand /.
Exactly /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elisabeth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> a very thorny issue for this president uh who is uh very open about his <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christianity</ENAMEX> /.
and now we have the situation where it appears this gentleman who c- converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christianity</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> has been spared the death penalty /.
But it 's going an ongoing issue as Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> seemed to indicate as that democracy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> goes through some serious growing pains dealing with religious rights women 's rights civil rights human rights /.
Right well this is what happens when you call for democracy in in problematic parts of the world /.
We saw this in the elections in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> territories obviously /.
What do you do when you call for democracy and the wrong party wins on in your view /?
This was also going on a- in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> /.
Um the president was ver- /-
You know you saw him this week saying he ne- this was deeply troubling /.
Um I was -- it would be interesting to know what was going on behind the scenes and wh- what kind of pressure was put on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> our good ally /.
Um obviously uh uh it looks like they got out of this one for now /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John uh Harwood</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> o- t- openly talking about <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> troop withdrawals /.
How much are politicans expecting to have significant troop withdrawals before the midterm elections /?
I think <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> are definitely expecting it and that could change the political environment /.
That 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the biggest drivers of this wrong track sentiment that we 've been talking about this morning /.
Uh but eh as uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> discussed <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> do n't exactly have a clear voice /.
They 're going to try to finesse it this week and have an event drawing together all factions of the party behind criticizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and calling for some sort of transition without specifying exactly how it 's going to take place trying to to have an umbrella under which those who want to withdraw troops quickly and those who want to mo- go more slowly can all rally behind /.
Is n't that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> ' hope <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> that by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> enough troops have come home the President can then give a speech that w- says you see /.
we 're making progress /.
Stay the course /.
Do n't take a chance by going on with these other guys and doing something dangerous /.
If that happens the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> would benefit /.
and the country would benefit /.
And uh let 's just hope that it 's possible /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Cook</ENAMEX> politically will that be enough to deal with people 's anxieties concerns about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /?
That would help a lot /.
I mean your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> polls show that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> was just a wet blanket over the administration /.
It was weighing everything down /.
And these <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> members one of us <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of them told us he comes in for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> conference lunch and he can tell who 's just gotten a poll back that they have this shell - shocked look on their face /.
Somebody else said ashen /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> other member said suddenly they start going into fundraising frenzies because they 're getting polls back in their individual districts that are starting to reflect those national numbers that look so horrible for them /.
It 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March</ENAMEX> madness for congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> too <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> /.
I 'll tell you that /.
Speaking of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March</ENAMEX> madness you 're a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Duke</ENAMEX> man /.
Who do you like now /?
Boy I 'm rooting for George Mason /.
