I want my voice and the voice of every citizen to be heard , male and female , who cares about the reputation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Medina</ENAMEX> , in the form and substance of our <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslim</ENAMEX> moral values , of what we the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Medina</ENAMEX> , neighbors of the Messenger of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> -LRB- Peace Be Upon Him -RRB- , see . ... because it makes the heart bleed and brings tears to the eyes ...
what we see on this street depresses us .
Unfortunately , it has turned into a street for immoral youth gatherings which distort the public image this street has .
It is called <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Sultana Street</ENAMEX>
In the past , it was a breathing space for the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Medina</ENAMEX> .
It is very important because it has shopping malls , stores and restaurants .
The people of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Medina</ENAMEX> come here on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesdays , Thursdays and Fridays</ENAMEX> .
But now , it has become unbearable and we ca n't go there even if we have our men with us .
So we have to make do with small restaurants and shops faraway from this street .
There are groups of youths on the sidewalks and as for their clothes , one feels too embarrassed to look .
I feel like their pants are about to drop as they 're so low down on the waist .
All they care about is finding women and harassing them .
Even a married woman walking with her children is not safe from their harassment .
I swear , some groups of young people set up teams to skate on the sidewalk and street and go between cars on what they call <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skateboards</ENAMEX> .
