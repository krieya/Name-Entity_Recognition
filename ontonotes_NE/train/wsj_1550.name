The list of laboratories claiming to be producing inexplicable amounts of heat from `` cold fusion '' experiments is slowly growing .
But the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms .
New experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions , leaving only the finding of tritium in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> experiment to support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">University of Utah</ENAMEX> chemists ' claim of achieving hydrogen fusion at room temperatures .
The latest developments in cold fusion research were presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</ENAMEX> reports delivered at the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fall</ENAMEX> meeting here of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Electrochemical Society</ENAMEX> , the first scientific meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five months</ENAMEX> to hear formal reports on cold fusion experiments .
The meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research .
Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,300</ENAMEX> chemists registered for the society 's weeklong meeting , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 200</ENAMEX> sat through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day and a half</ENAMEX> of cold fusion presentations at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week 's end</ENAMEX> .
This was in contrast with the society 's meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last May</ENAMEX> , at the height of the controversy , when <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,500</ENAMEX> scientists , along with scores of reporters and TV crews , crowded into a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> hotel ballroom for a tumultuous special <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> session on the subject .
Neither of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> chemists whose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> experiments triggered the cold fusion uproar , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Fleischmann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. Stanley Pons</ENAMEX> , were at the meeting .
But some members of an ad hoc expert committee set up by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Department of Energy</ENAMEX> to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience .
The committee is to recommend at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</ENAMEX> whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DOE</ENAMEX> should support cold fusion research .
Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two dozen</ENAMEX> scientists taking the podium reported results with new , more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis - of - water experiments described <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last March</ENAMEX> by Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleischmann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pons</ENAMEX> .
The experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> electrodes into `` heavy '' water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium .
When an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes , the heavy water did begin to break up , or dissociate .
Ordinarily the electrolysis , or breakup , of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy .
But Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleischmann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pons</ENAMEX> said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat .
The heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in , they reported .
Because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation , they asserted that the `` excess '' heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod .
As of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last weekend</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozen</ENAMEX> labs also have reported measuring `` excess '' heat from similar electrolytic experiments , although amounts of such heat vary widely .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> reports presented here of excess heat production was given by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard A. Oriani</ENAMEX> , professor of chemical engineering at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of Minnesota</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oriani</ENAMEX> said his skepticism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> claims was initially confirmed when his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> experiments <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last spring</ENAMEX> failed to produce results .
But he then borrowed a palladium rod from chemists at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas A-AMP-M</ENAMEX> who said they were getting excess heat .
`` The results were fascinating , '' he said .
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> `` run '' with the borrowed rod , the experiment began producing excess heat .
The experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument .
When it was restarted , heat output `` really took off '' and produced excess heat for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</ENAMEX> before dying down , he said .
Typical of other experiments , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oriani</ENAMEX> said his experiment was `` very erratic . ''
It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times , it would begin producing excess heat for as long as <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10 or 11 hours</ENAMEX> before quieting down .
The excess heat was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % to 20 %</ENAMEX> more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of water .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oriani</ENAMEX> said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times , as some scientists have suggested .
`` There is a reality to the excess energy , '' he said .
Other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</ENAMEX> at a time .
The bursts often occur , they said , after they `` perturbed '' the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied , or switching the current off and on .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> chemist privately suggested this hinted that some `` anomalous '' chemical reactions might be producing the heat .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements .
Typically , the input energy ranges from <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a third of a watt</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one watt</ENAMEX> and the excess energy is measured in <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tenths of a watt</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> exception is a continuing experiment at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Stanford University</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as much as 10 watts</ENAMEX> of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells .
A cell filled with heavy water is producing <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.0 to 1.5 watts</ENAMEX> more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary water next to it , reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turgut M. Gur</ENAMEX> , an associate of materials scientist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert A. Huggins</ENAMEX> , head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Stanford</ENAMEX> experimental team .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by chemist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bockris</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas A-AMP-M University</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bockris</ENAMEX> previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water .
He said that within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few days</ENAMEX> , he 's gotten evidence that there is a `` weak correlation '' between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium .
There is n't any way to continuously measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water , so it 's been difficult to tell whether the tritium formation is related to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon .
Increasingly careful attempts to measure neutrons , which would be strong evidence of fusion reactions , continue to be negative .
Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleischmann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pons</ENAMEX> initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable .
Researchers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sandia National Laboratories</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albuquerque</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.M.</ENAMEX> , reported they went so far as to take a `` cold fusion '' experiment and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> neutron detectors into a tunnel under <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 feet</ENAMEX> of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays .
A number of times they detected neutrons in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> , sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> , of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> detectors , but only once during <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">411 hours</ENAMEX> of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</ENAMEX> detectors -- and they think that was a spurious event .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shimson Gottesfeld</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Los Alamos National Laboratory</ENAMEX> said researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last April</ENAMEX> but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it .
In subsequent experiments , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time .
They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , new experiments indicated that the lithium added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod -- which Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleischmann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pons</ENAMEX> might have misinterpreted , reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Ross</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> laboratory .
