The east and south slopes of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Changbai Mountain</ENAMEX> are both on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korean</ENAMEX> side of the boundary , if you want to see <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">lake Tianchi</ENAMEX> , you have to cross the border .
Originally , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> had not set up any border sentry posts on the edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Lake Tianchi</ENAMEX> .
It was only after road construction progressed and the number of project labourers near the border gradually increased , that <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korean</ENAMEX> border sentry posts were set up on the side of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Lake Tianchi</ENAMEX> .
So people are not allowed to approach and cross the border at the edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Lake Tianchi</ENAMEX> .
But , after all , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> are not enemies and it is still possible to cross over if you talk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korean</ENAMEX> border guards .
A " token of appreciation " will be necessary .
We went through all sorts of hardship to see it .
Our hearts were in our throats as the labourer that we sent negotiated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korean</ENAMEX> border guards
After <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several</ENAMEX> days of rushing about , if we did n't get to see it after arriving at the border , I think each of us would definitely feel extremely chagrined from our heart .
I prayed silently
Time went by minute after minute .
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korean</ENAMEX> soldiers finally let us cross over , we were too excited to express how we felt .
Just because it was n't easy , when we got our first glimpse of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Lake Tianchi</ENAMEX> , everybody excitedly let out a shout
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Heaven</ENAMEX> in the end gave us faces and the weather also was pretty fair .
Because being able to see <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Lake Tianchi</ENAMEX> in this season totally depend on luck .
Most of the time it is cloudy and the lake ca n't be seen -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Lake Tianchi 's</ENAMEX> color changes every moment .
It is really beautiful ! -RRB- .
