Chicken Chains Ruffled By Loss of Customers
FAST - FOOD chicken chains , faced with a worsening business slump , are struggling to hatch some new marketing strategies .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Crest Report</ENAMEX> , which tracks consumer purchases , says customer traffic at chicken restaurants fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the second quarter</ENAMEX> , while the overall fast - food customer count was down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</ENAMEX> .
Chicken business is off largely because of more competition from grocery - store convenience food , home - delivered pizza and other takeout fare , says a spokesman for the report , a publication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NPD Group</ENAMEX> , a market research firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y</ENAMEX> .
The loss of more customers is the latest in a string of problems .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Church 's Fried Chicken Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Popeye 's Famous Fried Chicken Inc.</ENAMEX> , which have merged , are still troubled by overlapping restaurant locations .
Chicken chains also are feeling more pressure from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald 's Corp.</ENAMEX> , which introduced its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">McChicken</ENAMEX> sandwich <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> and recently tested the sale of individual pieces of chicken .
New management at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PepsiCo Inc.</ENAMEX> , has fought back with new medium and large chicken sandwiches for the lunch crowd .
And the chain is testing products that are n't fried , such as `` char - grilled '' chicken , to try to win health - conscious consumers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> also is testing home - delivery of chicken , which could be a hit with stay - at - home diners .
But some fast - food industry analysts say problems with keeping chicken warm and fresh must be solved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> spokesman , however , disputed the notion that the delivery service experienced problems in some markets where testing has been discontinued .
He says the test is continuing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , and a few other cities .
The advertising industry is buzzing with rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> will drop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Young -AMP- Rubicam</ENAMEX> and seek a new ad agency .
But the company declines to comment .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emanuel Goldman</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber Inc.</ENAMEX> analyst , predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> will post an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</ENAMEX> drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> net income .
`` They 've been laggard , '' he says , `` but they 'll have to become more aggressive . ''
Reluctant Advertisers Try Soft - Sell Spots
CALL IT un-advertising .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> consultant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Bear</ENAMEX> is selling a soft approach to clients who want exposure yet shun pushy ads .
His ploy : <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">60 - second</ENAMEX> radio spots that offer helpful hints .
The only plug for the sponsor is a brief mention at the end of the spot .
The messages resemble <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Business Traveler</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> dose of travel tips developed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bear</ENAMEX> and sponsored by travel agencies in several major cities .
New un-advertisers include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Burt Hill Kosar Rittlemann Associates</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Butler</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , architectural firm .
Its radio series features such spots as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Floodlights : Evening Wear for Urban Structures</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Building a Place to Park</ENAMEX> . ''
A harder sell , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kosar</ENAMEX> , the firm 's president , would `` detract from the profession . ''
Hospitals have signed up to use the messages to promote fundraisers , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Equitable Gas Co.</ENAMEX> is considering the format to offer energy tips to consumers .
But such spots can be too soft .
`` There 's always a risk of lost messages , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Fitzgerald</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ketchum Advertising USA</ENAMEX> , which created similar radio spots for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pittsburgh National Bank</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's a question of how much credibility you gain for the possible loss of recognition . ''
Retailer Sees Pitfalls In Environmental Push
HERE 'S a retailer that 's getting tough in the push for environmentally safe packaging and products .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Bear Supermarkets Inc.</ENAMEX> , a grocery chain based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> , plans to display shelf cards and distribute pamphlets recommending products deemed safe for the environment .
The choices will be based on research by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the San Diego Environmental Health Coalition</ENAMEX> and will include products like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Murphy 's Oil Soap</ENAMEX> and other noncorrosive cleaners .
But the chain is quickly realizing the pitfalls of such endorsements .
For example , it recommends nonchlorinated dishwasher detergent and puts <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sunlight</ENAMEX> on its environmentally safe list .
That does n't thrill <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Procter -AMP- Gamble Co.</ENAMEX> , maker of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cascade</ENAMEX> dishwasher detergent .
A company spokesman questioned the validity of the list , noting that chlorine is present in all major dishwasher detergents .
In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lever Bros.</ENAMEX> confirms that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sunlight</ENAMEX> brand does contain chlorine bleach , even though it is n't listed on the label for the powder version .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas G. Dahlen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Bear 's</ENAMEX> executive vice president , said the chain is still reviewing its product list to avoid such problems .
`` Our intent is to promote the best alternative , '' he says .
`` And it 's important that we be accurate . ''
But in the end , customers ' wishes are what will prevail .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Bear</ENAMEX> does n't care for disposable diapers , which are n't biodegradable .
Yet parents demand them .
Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dahlen</ENAMEX> , `` We 'll still be forced to sell items we might not philosophically agree with . ''
Odds and Ends
NEATNESS does count -- at least in the grocery store .
A study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Safeway 's Scanner Marketing Research</ENAMEX> shows soap sales climbed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> when bars were neatly stacked on shelves instead of dumped in a wire basket ... .
Which celebrity endorsers are most believable ?
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third year</ENAMEX> in a row , consumers voted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Cosby</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Garner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> in persuasiveness as spokesmen in TV commercials , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Video Storyboard Tests</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael J. Fox</ENAMEX> replaced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Willis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> place ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cher</ENAMEX> placed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> time .
