A schoolchild writes : " When I grow up I want to be a clown " in his exercise book .
If his teacher is <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> , the probable response is : " No ambition !
Hardly worth teaching ! "
But with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> teacher , it 's more likely to be : " Go on and fill the world with laughter ! "
In <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> society it has been traditional to place demands on children rather than give them encouragement , and the idea of what constitutes " success " has been fairly narrowly defined .
Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> / <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> values have been much extolled in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</ENAMEX> .
Is the concept of children 's rights , and human rights as a whole , really incompatible with so - called " <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> values " ?
As members of the global village in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</ENAMEX> , what route should we follow ?
It was former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> premier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Kuan Yew</ENAMEX> who <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> raised the banner of " <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> Values . "
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> said in an interview : " For <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East Asian</ENAMEX> countries like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> , group values and behavior have been extremely helpful in the process of ' catching up ' economically .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East Asian</ENAMEX> values , such as the need to sacrifice individual interests in pursuit of the group interest , have been a major impetus for the region 's rapid development . "
Group society
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> survey , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asians</ENAMEX> are more likely than <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> to regard such things as " close family relations , " " an orderly society , " " respect for knowledge " and " maintaining group harmony " as important values .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the United Nations World Human Rights Convention</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's delegate responded to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> 's frequent criticisms of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's human rights record in the following terms : " The concept of human rights is a legacy of historical development , and is connected with a country 's specific social and economic situation , as well as its history , culture and values .
There are different human rights requirements at different stages of historical development .
Countries at different phases of development , or with different historical traditions and cultural background , understand and deal with human rights in different ways , so the human rights standards of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> country can not be uniformly applied around the world , in the expectation that other countries will act in line with those standards .
From obligations to rights
From the viewpoint of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">East Asian</ENAMEX> societies , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> tends to over-emphasize freedom and individual rights , and this leads to serious problems .
But from the modern perspective , the traditional values of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East Asia</ENAMEX> are even less palatable .
In the traditional feudal society of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , the head of the family exercised unquestioned authority .
Under the precepts of filial piety , children had neither free will nor the right to be independent entities .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of the tales in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yuan dynasty</ENAMEX> work <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">24 Paragons of Filial Piety</ENAMEX> records that in ancient times a man named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guo Ju</ENAMEX> , who was too poor to keep his mother properly fed , proposed to his wife that they kill their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - year - old</ENAMEX> son - since he was consuming a share of the old lady 's food .
This they duly did , digging a pit and burying the boy alive .
The legal code of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the Qing dynasty</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1644 - 1911</ENAMEX> -RRB- stated that where parents brought charges against their offspring , the accused were automatically considered guilty and there was no need for a formal trial .
And for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">most of the past millennium</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> criminal law provided that unfililal conduct - such as hitting or cursing a parent - could be accepted as just cause in the cases of parents who murdered their offspring .
Those old - time filial paragons and legal codes are wildly at odds with today 's notions of children 's rights , and basic human rights as a whole .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang Mei - ying</ENAMEX> , a professor of primary education at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taipei Municipal Teachers College</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Confucian</ENAMEX> thought does include emphasis on human rights , such as the expectation that fathers should be " compassionate , " sons " filially pious , " a monarch " benevolent " and his ministers " loyal . "
What it does n't do is propose ways of dealing with a father who is not compassionate and a monarch who is not benevolent .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang</ENAMEX> feels that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Confucian</ENAMEX> thought basically stresses obligations , but that in modern society the idea of obligations is no longer a straightforward matter : when person A neglects to fulfil his obligations , person B can be said to have been deprived of his rights .
But when we start out from the notion of rights , and support those rights with legal guarantees , we find it is better to have guaranteed rights than to depend on everyone fulfilling their obligations .
The best of both worlds
Neighboring places heavily influenced by " <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> values , " such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , have a strong sense of how important it is to belong to " the educated class , " just as we do here .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang Mei - ying</ENAMEX> points out , this means that parents expect their children to perform outstandingly well at school .
The importance that parents attach to education is of course a strong point for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> drawback of this is that parents often set their expectations too high .
At an age when most kids in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> are still playing every day , our children have already started shuttling about among supplementary schools for classes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> , computers , abacus and art .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang</ENAMEX> explains that although <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> children seem to be playing about , they are also finding out what interests them , and they have plenty of chances to change direction .
Here , however , the education system gives children hardly any opportunity for making choices , and education is foisted on them rather than being something they seek for themselves .
Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang</ENAMEX> : " A lot of people these days hide themselves at graduate school , partly to put off confronting reality and partly to continue meeting their parents ' expectations .
Nowadays we even have cram schools for graduate school students . "
However , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> educational model , in which children are shown respect and allowed to decide and choose for themselves , is not without drawbacks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> - who was pushing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">forty</ENAMEX> by the time he earned his <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">PhD</ENAMEX> - says that when he was younger , whenever he had an important choice to make about his future and asked his parents for their opinion , the response was : " We 'll respect and support you no matter what you decide ! "
Now he feels that he has squandered a lot of time because of vacillation and a lack of clear guidance .
Modern parents at a loss
With <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's mingling of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Eastern</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> values , and modern and traditional concepts , it is no wonder that parents find themselves at a bit of a loss .
The difficulty is that they ca n't simply dismiss deeply ingrained traditional notions , but at the same time they need to adapt to the values of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the modern age</ENAMEX> .
The intellectual understanding is there but it has n't yet been fully internalized , and this accounts for the gap that can often be seen between understanding and behavior .
An inkling of this can be seen in the results of a recent online ballot conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Hsin Yi Foundation</ENAMEX> , asking parents about their " educational approach or concepts . "
The runaway leader , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21 %</ENAMEX> of votes , was the approach summed up in the sentence : " I praise my children with phrases like ' that 's great ! ' and ' good boy / girl ! ' "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Sing - ju</ENAMEX> , executive director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Hsin Yi Foundation</ENAMEX> , points out that modern parents know how important it is to give children encouragement , and this shows there has been a lot of progress .
But there are still pitfalls to watch out for .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> says that many parents use praise without making it clear to the child just what he is being praised for , and this " cheats " the child rather than showing him true respect .
It 's the process that counts
A child who is treated with respect wo n't stop studying on account of this .
And a child who is free to make his own choices does n't automatically turn into a delinquent .
Experimental classes giving pupils the chance for self - motivated study are now being offered in some schools in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , and the results show that these children are happier and more positive .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce Yen Feng</ENAMEX> , executive director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Child Welfare League Foundation</ENAMEX> , an organization dedicated to promoting the rights of children , says that there does n't have to be a contradiction between granting children their rights and maintaining <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> values .
In the past , too much emphasis on schoolwork and good grades encouraged the development of a society in which many are crudely obsessed with personal gain .
Stressing children 's rights is one way to change that mentality , and there is basically nothing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="3">un-Asian</ENAMEX> about using respect and enlightenment to pursue the very best outcome .
In other words , we need to draw on the strengths of both <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Eastern</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> culture , to show that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> values are also global values .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> , we 're all human and we share the same values , and this applies equally to the rights of children .
p. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</ENAMEX>
In this transitional era , caught between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> , traditional and modern , parents have to be ready to respond to new challenges all the time .
