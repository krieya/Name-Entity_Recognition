Here 's the latest on our top story <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> --
It 's a day of celebration in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> as the country prepares to welcome a new President .
An official swearing - in ceremony for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vojislav Kostunica</ENAMEX> should be held later <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> in the capital city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alessio Vinci</ENAMEX> says the event was scheduled to take place <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hours ago</ENAMEX> but has been delayed because of a prolonged meeting of the newly elected <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> parliament .
This point we understand the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> chambers are meeting separately because the mandates of all the deputies must be checked out and confronted .
At this point we understand that there are some problems with some deputies in the upper house of the federal parliament .
There are some votes that apparently were counted wrong .
Anyway , it 's unclear exactly what 's happening , but they are contesting some seats .
In that case if the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> chamber can not agree and meet here , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kostunica</ENAMEX> until then will not be able to take his hold .
Outgoing President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> had refused to concede defeat in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month 's</ENAMEX> presidential election until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
Independent observers had declared <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kostunica</ENAMEX> the winner , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> had disputed the result , calling for a run - off .
That spurred widespread protests and prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yugoslavians</ENAMEX> to descend on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> .
The demonstrators were met with tear gas <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> as they stormed the parliament building .
The protesters also took control of the building containing the state - run television network .
In a televised address <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , Milosevic congratulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kostunica</ENAMEX> on his victory and said he will take a break before returning to political life .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> has learned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> 's son , daughter - in - law and grandson left the country <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</ENAMEX> .
The President of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Yugoslav Pilots ' Union</ENAMEX> says they flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> carrying only a few pieces of luggage .
