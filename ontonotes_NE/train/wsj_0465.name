Medical scientists are starting to uncover a handful of genes which , if damaged , unleash the chaotic growth of cells that characterizes cancer .
Scientists say the discovery of these genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</ENAMEX> is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops .
An emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention .
That is for the future .
Already , scientists are developing tests based on the newly identified genes that , for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time , can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely to get cancer .
`` It 's a super-exciting set of discoveries , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bert Vogelstein</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Johns Hopkins University</ENAMEX> researcher who has just found a gene pivotal to the triggering of colon cancer .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Only a decade ago</ENAMEX> cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and , then , propel it into a deadly state . ''
Scientists call the new class of genes tumor - suppressors , or simply anti-cancer genes .
When functioning normally , they make proteins that hold a cell 's growth in check .
But if the genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation , a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division -- their growth - suppressing proteins no longer work , and cells normally under control turn malignant .
The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</ENAMEX> called oncogenes .
Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant , but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells , suggesting that oncogenes do n't cause cancer by themselves .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</ENAMEX> , researchers have come to believe the two types of cancer genes work in concert : An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor - suppressor gene has been damaged .
Like all genes , tumor - suppressor genes are inherited in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> copies , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> from each parent .
Either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth , so for cancer to arise , both copies must be impaired .
A person who is born with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> defective copy of a suppressor gene , or in whom <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> copy is damaged early in life , is especially prone to cancer because he need only lose the other copy for a cancer to develop .
Emerging genetic tests will be able to spot such cancer - susceptible individuals , ushering in what some scientists believe is a new age of predictive cancer diagnosis .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonnie Quinlan</ENAMEX> are among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> beneficiaries of the new findings .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dedham</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , couple knew even before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonnie</ENAMEX> became pregnant in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> that any child of theirs had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma , an eye cancer that occurs about once every <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</ENAMEX> births .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinlan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years old</ENAMEX> , knew he carried a damaged gene , having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only two months old</ENAMEX> -- after his mother had suffered the same fate when she was a baby .
Because of the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor - suppressor gene , it became possible <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last January</ENAMEX> to find out what threat the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinlan</ENAMEX> baby faced .
A test using new `` genetic probes '' showed that little <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will Quinlan</ENAMEX> had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and , therefore , faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer .
`` It made our <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</ENAMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinlan</ENAMEX> .
This test was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> to predict reliably whether an individual could expect to develop cancer .
Equally important , the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth , made by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> doctor named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thaddeus Dryja</ENAMEX> , has opened a field of cancer study , which in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</ENAMEX> has exploded .
`` It turns out that studying a tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Broder</ENAMEX> , director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> .
`` All this may not be obvious to the public , which is concerned about advances in treatment , but I am convinced this basic research will begin showing results there soon . ''
To date , scientists have fingered <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of these cancer - suppressors .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dryja</ENAMEX> made his retinoblastoma discovery in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> .
Then <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last spring</ENAMEX> , researchers reported finding a gene called p53 which , if impaired , turns healthy colon cells cancerous .
Soon after that report , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> other research teams uncovered evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and breast cancers .
Colon , lung and breast cancers are the most common and lethal forms of the disease , collectively killing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 200,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> a year .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Right now</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a dozen</ENAMEX> laboratories , in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> , are racing to unmask other suspected tumor - suppressing genes .
They have <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about seven</ENAMEX> candidates .
Researchers say the inactivation of tumor - suppressor genes , alone or in combination , appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain , the skin , kidney , prostate , and cervix .
There is evidence that if people inherit defective versions of these genes , they are especially prone to cancer , perhaps explaining , finally , why some cancers seem to haunt certain families .
The story of tumor - suppressor genes goes back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1970s</ENAMEX> , when a pediatrician named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred G. Knudson Jr.</ENAMEX> proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects .
He theorized that in the eye cancer , an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other .
The tumor , he suggested , developed when the second , normal copy also was damaged .
But there was no way to prove Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knudson</ENAMEX> 's `` two - hit '' theory .
Back then , scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes , but under a microscope they could see the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</ENAMEX> pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes .
Occasionally , gross chromosome damage was visible .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knudson</ENAMEX> found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</ENAMEX> from a parent who had had the disease .
Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</ENAMEX> was missing .
He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer .
But he did n't know which gene or genes had disappeared .
Then , a scientific team led by molecular geneticist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster Cavenee</ENAMEX> , then at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of Utah</ENAMEX> , found the answer .
The team used a battery of the newly developed `` gene probes , '' snippets of genetic material that can track a gene 's presence in a cell .
By analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors , they found defects in the second copy of chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</ENAMEX> in the exact area as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> copy of the chromosome .
The finding riveted medicine .
It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer .
`` It was extraordinarily satisfying , '' says Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knudson</ENAMEX> , now at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox Chase Cancer Research Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> .
`` I was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers . ''
It was an audacious claim .
But in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> , Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogelstein</ENAMEX> , a young molecular biologist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Johns Hopkins Medical School</ENAMEX> , believed Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knudson</ENAMEX> was right , and set out to repeat the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cavenee</ENAMEX> experiment in cells from other cancers .
His was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> research teams in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called Wilm 's tumor .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogelstein</ENAMEX> next turned his attention to colon cancer , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> biggest cancer killer in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> after lung cancer .
He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hits '' on cancer suppressor genes , because it often seems to develop in stages .
It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel , which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages -- progressing from less severe to deadly -- as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogelstein</ENAMEX> and a doctoral student , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Fearon</ENAMEX> , began <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage .
They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions , some existing only in benign polyps , others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells .
Gradually , a coherent picture of cancer development emerged .
If both copies of a certain gene were knocked out , benign polyps would develop .
If both copies of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> gene were then deleted , the polyps would progress to malignancy .
It was clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</ENAMEX> gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop .
Their report galvanized other molecular biologists .
`` It was the confirming evidence we all needed that -LCB- gene -RCB- losses were critical to the development of a common tumor , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray White</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX> .
But Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogelstein</ENAMEX> had yet to nail the identity of the gene that , if damaged , flipped a colon cell into full - blown malignancy .
They focused on chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> .
For months the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Johns Hopkins</ENAMEX> researchers , using gene probes , experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> , looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells .
Such a piece of DNA would probably constitute a gene .
When they found it <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last winter</ENAMEX> , Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogelstein</ENAMEX> was dubious that the search was over .
His doubts stemmed from the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several years earlier</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Princeton University</ENAMEX> researcher , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Levine</ENAMEX> , had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones .
The deletion Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogelstein</ENAMEX> found was in exactly the same spot as p53 .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX> had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth , whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Johns Hopkins</ENAMEX> scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth .
Despite that , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Johns Hopkins</ENAMEX> scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with the Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX> 's p53 gene they found the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> were identical ; it turned out that in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX> 's cancer studies , he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 -- a cancer - suppressing gene .
The discovery `` suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Weinberg</ENAMEX> , a leader in cancer - gene research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Whitehead Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX> .
Evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other cancers , too .
Researchers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edinburgh</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> , have found that in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</ENAMEX> breast tumors , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> copy of chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies .
The scientists say that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families , the gene , when inherited in a damaged form , may predispose women to the cancer .
The p53 gene has just been implicated in lung cancer .
In a report out <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Minna</ENAMEX> and colleagues at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> say that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</ENAMEX> the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene .
There also are reports from several labs , as yet unpublished , of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney , brain and skin cancers .
At the same time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Johns Hopkins</ENAMEX> team and others are rushing to pinpoint other tumor - suppressor genes .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogelstein</ENAMEX> hopes soon to isolate <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> on chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</ENAMEX> , also involved in colon cancer .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray White</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Bodmer</ENAMEX> , a researcher in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Britain</ENAMEX> , are close to finding another gene involved with some types of colon cancer , thought to be on chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</ENAMEX> .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minna</ENAMEX> believes people who inherit a defective gene somewhere on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> copies of chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</ENAMEX> are especially prone to lung cancer .
Recently , he and others reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may also be involved in some lung cancers , as well as several other more common cancers , too .
Where these discoveries will lead , scientists can only speculate .
Already <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> major pharmaceutical companies , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Squibb</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bristol - Myers Squibb Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hoffmann - La Roche Inc.</ENAMEX> , are collaborating with gene hunters to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and , maybe , new therapies .
Some researchers say new cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the suppressor proteins normally produced by the genes .
The idea would be to administer to patients the growth - controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes .
It may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions , though no one has come close to doing that so far .
In any case , says Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minna</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> , `` We 're witnessing the discovery of one of the most important steps in the genesis of cancer .
