<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Southwest Airline</ENAMEX> pilots were reportedly fired for stripping down .
It was n't part of a security check .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">`` USA Today ''</ENAMEX> says the pilots were dismissed for allegedly taking off all or most of their clothes in the cockpit .
I want to make that distinction there .
The pilots are calling the sdebt -- incident a misunderstanding and appealing their termination .
