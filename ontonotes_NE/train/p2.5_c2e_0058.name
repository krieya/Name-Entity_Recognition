After the collapse of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein 's</ENAMEX> dictatorial regime , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> religious forces had entered a period of revitalization and expansion ,
Although the distribution system of the new legislative power in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> had generally taken care of the interests of all parties , and found a relatively reasonable balance point among all ethnic groups and sects -- otherwise a management committee , the interim constitution , and the current interim government would not have been successfully generated -- this does not mean that there were no contradictions among them .
From an internal point of view , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiites</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kurds</ENAMEX> tend to see eye to eye on the political and economic benefits , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> politics had almost become the arena of these two factions ,
Although under the balance of interests some of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunni</ENAMEX> political figures were involved in politics , what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunni</ENAMEX> radical groups were most concerned about was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiites</ENAMEX> would turn around and suppress them in the future .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February</ENAMEX> of this year , a radical <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunni</ENAMEX> organization attacked <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Ali Mosque</ENAMEX> , which is the religious shrine of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiite Muslims</ENAMEX> , and this led to the eruption of the conflict between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</ENAMEX> largest parties .
