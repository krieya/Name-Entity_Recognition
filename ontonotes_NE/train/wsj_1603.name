For <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> , these are tricky , often treacherous , times .
After years of hesitation , economic and political reform was embraced at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 1986</ENAMEX> , but ringing declarations have yet to be translated into much action .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> is finding that turning a stagnant socialist order into a dynamic free market does n't come easy .
Here is how <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> are coping with change :
The Tire King
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nguyen Van Chan</ENAMEX> is living proof that old ways die hard .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> used to be an oddity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hanoi</ENAMEX> : a private entrepreneur .
His business success made him an official target in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">pre-reform days</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> , now <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">64 years old</ENAMEX> , invented a fountain pen he and his family produced from plastic waste .
Later , he marketed glue .
Both products were immensely popular .
For his troubles , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> was jailed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> times <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1960 and 1974</ENAMEX> .
Though his operation was registered and used only scrap , he was accused of conducting illegal business and possessing illegal materials .
Once he was held for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</ENAMEX> without being charged .
Things were supposed to change when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> 's economic reforms gathered pace , and for awhile they did .
After years of experimenting , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> produced a heavy - duty bicycle tire that outlasted its state - produced rival .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> , he was selling <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of tires .
Newspapers published articles about him , and he was hailed as `` the tire king . ''
His efforts earned a gold medal at a national exhibition -- and attracted renewed attention from local authorities .
District police in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</ENAMEX> descended on his suburban home , which he and his large family used as both residence and factory , and demanded proof the house and equipment were his .
He produced it .
`` That was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time they lost and I won , '' he says .
He was further questioned to determine if he was `` a real working man or an exploiter . ''
Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> : `` When I showed it was from my own brain , they lost for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> time . ''
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days later</ENAMEX> the police accused him of stealing electricity , acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property .
Warned he was to be jailed again , he fled to the countryside .
His family was given <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</ENAMEX> to leave before the house and contents were confiscated .
With only the clothes they were wearing , family members moved to a home owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> 's sons .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</ENAMEX> on the run , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> learned the order for his arrest had been canceled .
He rejoined his family in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1984</ENAMEX> and began the long struggle for justice , pressing everyone from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hanoi</ENAMEX> municipal officials to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Assembly</ENAMEX> deputies for restoration of his rights .
He and his family kept afloat by repairing bicycles , selling fruit and doing odd jobs .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> achieved a breakthrough in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> -- and became a minor celebrity again -- when his story was published in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> newspaper .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</ENAMEX> congress formally endorsed family - run private enterprise , district authorities allowed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> to resume work .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late last year</ENAMEX> he was invited back as `` the tire king '' to display his products at a national exhibition .
National leaders stopped by his stand to commend his achievements .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> now produces <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</ENAMEX> bicycle and motorbike tires a month and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</ENAMEX> tins of tire - patching glue in the son 's small house .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighteen</ENAMEX> people pack the house 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> rooms -- the Chans , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> children with spouses , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</ENAMEX> grandchildren .
Most sleep on the floor .
Come daybreak , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> family members and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> other workers unroll a sheet of raw rubber that covers the floor of the house and spills out onto the street .
The primitive operations also burst out the back door into a small courtyard , where an ancient press squeezes rubber solution into a flat strip and newly made tires are cooled in a bathtub filled with water .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> talks optimistically of expanding , maybe even moving into the import - export field .
First , however , he has unfinished business .
When district authorities allowed him to resume manufacturing , they released <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</ENAMEX> of his machines .
They did n't return the rubber stocks that represent his capital .
Nor did they return his house and contents , which he values at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 44,000</ENAMEX> .
He wants to recover more than just his property , though .
`` I want my dignity back , '' he says .
The Editor
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nguyen Ngoc</ENAMEX> seemed an obvious choice when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Vietnamese Writers Association</ENAMEX> was looking for a new editor to reform its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> newspaper , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Van Nghe</ENAMEX> .
After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</ENAMEX> congress , journalists seized the opportunity provided by the liberalization to probe previously taboo subjects .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ngoc</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">57 years old</ENAMEX> , had solid reformist credentials : He had lost his official position in the association in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">he early 1980s</ENAMEX> because he questioned the intrusion of politics into literature .
Appointed editor in chief in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1987</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ngoc</ENAMEX> rapidly turned the staid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Van Nghe</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> 's hottest paper .
Circulation soared as the weekly went way beyond standard literary themes to cover <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> society and its ills .
Readers were electrified by the paper 's audacity and appalled by the dark side of life it uncovered .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> article recounted a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</ENAMEX> - long struggle by a wounded soldier to prove , officially , he was alive .
Another described how tax - collection officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thanh Hoa</ENAMEX> province <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</ENAMEX> stormed through homes and confiscated rice from starving villagers .
The newspaper also ran a series of controversial short stories by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nguyen Huy Thiep</ENAMEX> , a former history teacher , who stirred debate over his interpretation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> culture and took a thinly veiled swipe at writers who had blocked his entry into their official association .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Nghe</ENAMEX> quickly made influential enemies .
`` Those who manage ideology and a large number of writers reacted badly '' to the restyled paper , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lai Nguyen An</ENAMEX> , a literary critic .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> of internal rumblings , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ngoc</ENAMEX> was fired <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last December</ENAMEX> .
His dismissal triggered a furor among intellectuals that continues <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
`` Under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ngoc</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Van Nghe</ENAMEX> protected the people instead of the government , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nguyen Duy</ENAMEX> , a poet who is the paper 's bureau chief for southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> .
`` The paper reflected the truth .
For the leadership , that was too painful to bear . ''
The ` Billionaire '
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nguyen Thi Thi</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> 's entrepreneur of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</ENAMEX> .
Her challenge is to keep her fledgling empire on top in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</ENAMEX> .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thi</ENAMEX> did n't wait for the reforms to get her start .
She charged ahead of the government and the law to establish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hochiminh City Food Co.</ENAMEX> as the biggest rice dealer in the country .
Her success , which included alleviating an urban food shortage in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</ENAMEX> , helped persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hanoi</ENAMEX> to take the reform path .
Her story is becoming part of local folklore .
A lifelong revolutionary with little education who fought both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - backed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saigon</ENAMEX> regime , she switched effortlessly to commerce after the war .
Her instincts were capitalistic , despite her background .
As she rode over regulations , only her friendship with party leaders , including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nguyen Van Linh</ENAMEX> , then <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ho Chi Minh City</ENAMEX> party secretary , kept her out of jail .
Following Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linh</ENAMEX> 's appointment as secretary - general of the party at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</ENAMEX> congress , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thi</ENAMEX> has become the darling of `` doi moi '' , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> version of perestroika .
The authorities have steered foreign reporters to her office to see an example of `` the new way of thinking . ''
Foreign publications have responded with articles declaring her <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> 's richest woman .
`` Some people call me the communist billionaire , '' she has told visitors .
Actually , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">67 - year - old</ENAMEX> Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thi</ENAMEX> is about as poor as almost everyone else in this impoverished land .
She has indeed turned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hochiminh City Food</ENAMEX> into a budding conglomerate , but the company itself remains state - owned .
She manages it with the title of general - director .
The heart of the business is the purchase of rice and other commodities , such as corn and coffee , from farmers in the south , paying with fertilizer , farm tools and other items .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hochiminh City Food</ENAMEX> says it bought <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two million metric tons</ENAMEX> of unhusked rice , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 %</ENAMEX> of the country 's output .
The company operates a fleet of trucks and boats to transport the commodities to its warehouses .
A subsidiary company processes commodities into foods such as instant noodles that are sold with the rice through a vast retail network .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thi</ENAMEX> has started to diversify the company , taking a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</ENAMEX> stake in newly established , partly private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Industrial and Commercial Bank</ENAMEX> , and setting up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saigon Petro</ENAMEX> , which owns and operates <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> oil refinery .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thi</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hochiminh City Food</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> increased pretax profit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> to the equivalent of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2.7 million</ENAMEX> on sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</ENAMEX> .
She expects both revenue and profit to gain <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
She is almost cavalier about the possibility <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> 's reforms will create rivals on her home turf .
`` I do n't mind the competition inside the country , '' she says .
`` I am only afraid that with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> 's poor - quality products we ca n't compete with neighboring countries .
