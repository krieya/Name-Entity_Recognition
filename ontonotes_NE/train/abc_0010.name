<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX> promised to catch and punish those responsible for the bombing of the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> '' and defended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> 's decision to refuel ships in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> as investigators continued their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> at work .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton Dean</ENAMEX> reports it 's a difficult <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> for the sailors remaining on board .
The stressful , monumental task for the crew on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> carrier suffered a setback .
The ship began to take on water and lost electrical power again .
A difficult time became even more difficult .
It led to the cancellation of a memorial service planned for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> sailors who lost their lives .
Details are becoming known about the damage , most obvious , the huge hole , but also the deck is buckled .
Even the superstructure is damaged .
Hatches twisted out of shape and bulkheads destroyed .
Rear Admiral <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Fitzgerald</ENAMEX> , who visited the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> , was stunned by the damage .
I wo n't tell you whether the ship is going to sink or not sink , but there was considerable damage to the ship .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials here <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> , the most important questions about the attack remain unanswered .
Any details or speculation on who specifically , we do n't know that at this point .
With <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">well over 100</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> investigators now in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> , the search for evidence is now fully under way .
It 's been officially designated `` <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Operation Determined Response</ENAMEX> , '' and that suggests several things that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , of course , is determined to discover who carried out the bombing and that any group who helped plan the attack faces a response from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> believes there are <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="5">anti-American</ENAMEX> terror groups based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</ENAMEX> the population lives in settlements with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> people or less , and senior <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials here say the government , although friendly to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> , does not have full control over the entire country .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> 's President has repeatedly said an internal explosion rocked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole</ENAMEX> , '' but <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials expect him to announce that he has changed his mind , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> , the search for bodies will resume .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> sailors are still mi missing .
