<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USX Corp.</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> partner , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kobe Steel Ltd.</ENAMEX> , agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce hot - dipped galvanized sheet products , mainly for the automotive market .
Terms were n't disclosed for the plant , which will have <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> capacity of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">600,000 tons</ENAMEX> .
The move by the nation 's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bethlehem Steel Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LTV Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Armco Inc.</ENAMEX> all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion - resistant steel .
The surge in production , analysts say , raises questions about capacity outpacing demand .
They note that most of the new plants will come on line in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> , when the current import trade restraint program ends , which could result in more imports .
`` There 's too much capacity , '' contended <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Bradford</ENAMEX> , an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ENAMEX> .
`` I do n't think there 's anyone not building one . ''
He does add , however , that transplanted <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> car makers are boosting the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - made steel in their autos , instead of relying heavily on imported steel .
That trend could increase demand for hot - dipped galvanized sheet .
The hot - dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest - growing and most profitable segments of the steel market , coveted by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and reconstructed mills -- those spun off to employees .
Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USX</ENAMEX> said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 million tons</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10.2 million tons</ENAMEX> shipped in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first eight months of 1989</ENAMEX> , analysts say shipments of hot - dipped galvanized steel increased <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> , while overall steel shipments were up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2.4 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kobe Steel</ENAMEX> hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 - 50</ENAMEX> partnership by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</ENAMEX> , with construction tentatively slated for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring of 1990</ENAMEX> and production by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USX</ENAMEX> already has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> lines in existing plants producing hot - dipped galvanized steel , but this marks the first so - called greenfield plant for such production .
Moreover , it will boost by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USX</ENAMEX> 's current hot - dipped capacity of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,275,000 tons</ENAMEX> .
The company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to adversely affect the company 's existing hot - dipped galvanizing lines .
Steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so - called electrogalvanized steel , which is another way to make coated corrosion - resistant steel .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of the advantages of the hot - dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly .
