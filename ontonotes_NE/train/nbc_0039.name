And <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the longest running struggles for international justice reached a milestone <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> of sorts , when a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Scottish</ENAMEX> court , meeting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> , finally officially found someone guilty in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> bombing that brought down <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pan Am Flight 103</ENAMEX> .
He 's a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Libyan</ENAMEX> intelligence agent and as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Maceda</ENAMEX> reports <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> from the court , many of the families of the victims think the verdict did n't go far enough .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">D - Day</ENAMEX> in the murder trial which in the end brought some relief .
For grieving families , only a partial victory .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">12 years</ENAMEX> of waiting and a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nine - month</ENAMEX> trial , family members of some of the victims of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pan Am Flight 103</ENAMEX> come to this special <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Scottish</ENAMEX> courthouse in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> last time to hear the verdict against <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Libyan</ENAMEX> defendants charged with murder .
A split decision for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamen Khalifa Fhimah</ENAMEX> , aquittal , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdel Basset Ali Al - megrahi</ENAMEX> found guilty as charged .
The court ruled this senior <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Libyan</ENAMEX> intelligence agent planted the bomb that killed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">270</ENAMEX> , mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> , when the plane bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> exploded over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> .
Inside the courtroom <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , the elation overwhelming .
A good many of the relatives gasped .
There was a big intake of breath .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Swire</ENAMEX> , whose daughter died in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> crash , collapses .
He later recovered , blaming stress .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - megrahi 's</ENAMEX> sentence , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</ENAMEX> in jail , too light for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Flynn</ENAMEX> .
His brother was on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 103</ENAMEX> .
It was n't <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> murder it was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">270</ENAMEX> people he murdered .
Frustration too that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moammar Khaddafi</ENAMEX> was immune from prosecution , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the ground rules here .
You get the operatives .
You do n't always get the higherups .
Reaction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX> , where many followed the trial , mixed .
Some anger in the streets , but government officials downplaying the conviction , calling for an end to international sanctions .
Not yet , says President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> , at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , demanding that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khaddafi</ENAMEX> meet certain conditions first , to accept responsibility for this act , and to compensate the families .
But even that would fall short for those who have lost loved ones .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Tonight</ENAMEX> , some of those families made it clear their battle is not over to get to the truth and however difficult , punish the real authors of this crime .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> ?
Thanks very much , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Maceda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> for the trial of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">103 Pan Am</ENAMEX> crash .
