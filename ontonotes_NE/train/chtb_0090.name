<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Xinhua News Agency</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 30th</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiaju Hou</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> economist , published an article with the title " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Three comments on ' do n't rush , be patient ' " in Taiwan 's " Daily Economy</ENAMEX> " on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> , pointing out that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> authorities ' adopting a " do n't rush , be patient " restriction policy for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> businessmen investing in our country 's mainland would give rise to many abuses .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiaju Hou</ENAMEX> points out that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> authorities say that " do n't rush , be patient " is to restrict large - sized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> companies from going to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's mainland to invest and would have no impact on medium - and small - sized companies , but this is actually not the case .
Currently , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> authorities define medium - and small - sized companies as having capital of under <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">60 million Taiwan dollars</ENAMEX> , but actually <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's current medium - and small - sized companies mostly have significant scale .
Taking medium and small - sized companies listed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> as top <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</ENAMEX> for example , the smallest net operating revenue of these was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.365 billion Taiwan dollars</ENAMEX> , the highest reached <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 billion Taiwan dollars</ENAMEX> .
Obviously , implementing a " do n't rush , be patient " policy will result in losing many business opportunities in our country 's mainland for no reason .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiaju Hou</ENAMEX> believed that the " do n't rush , be patient " policy would also have influence on exports to our country 's mainland .
Because , among exports from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> to our country 's mainland , a large portion are due to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> businessmen investing in setting up factories in our country 's mainland and needing to ship spare parts for machines and equipment and intermediate raw materials .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's trade surplus with our country 's mainland has accumulatively reached <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">80 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> , which is almost the same as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's foreign currency reserve .
While the financial storm shows no sign of relief <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , the importance of this surplus is more and more obvious .
How can <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> decrease exports to our country 's mainland for the sake of " do n't rush , be patient " ?
Because this will reduce its trade surplus with our country 's mainland .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiaju Hou</ENAMEX> pointed out that the " do n't rush , be patient " policy would also restrain foreign businessmen from investing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
Because most foreign businessmen investing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> want to take this opportunity to jointly invest in our country 's mainland with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> investments .
Therefore , this policy , while blocking the development of local enterprises , will also limit foreign businessmen 's wishes to invest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
It is reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiaju Hou</ENAMEX> has successively published <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</ENAMEX> articles in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> newspapers on the " do n't rush , be patient " policy , pointing out to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> authorities that this erroneous mainland economic and trade policy violates the " basic philosophy of free economy " , and hopes that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> authorities " are warned of the consequences " .
