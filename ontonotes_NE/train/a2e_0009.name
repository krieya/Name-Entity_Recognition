Details of the minutes of the meeting between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Airport Prison</ENAMEX> ...
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington</ENAMEX> offers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> a television appearance to stop the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Resistance</ENAMEX> in return for his freedom .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> - INA - from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aras An Nasiri</ENAMEX>
Minutes of the dialogue between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> from trusted <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> sources .
What follows is the text of the minutes
At the start of the conversation President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> appeared extremely calm .
Perhaps he was surprised that his guest was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> , but he did not appear at all nervously tense .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> began the conversation by saying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : I came to meet you to negotiate the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> ; we have made contact with some of your followers inside and outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , they have advised us to listen to you .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : So what do you want ?
Your forces have occupied the territory of the proud <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , you have brought down the governing regime without a legal support ,
you have assaulted the sovereignty of an independent free sovereign country ,
you have committed crimes which history will record against you as evidence of your blood - stained civilization .
So what do you want after all that ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> -LRB- trying to suppress his anger -RRB- : What 's past is past , I came especially to make you a clear and specific offer and I want to hear from you a clear and definite answer .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> -LRB- mockingly -RRB- : I thought you had come to apologize and restore power to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : We have nothing to apologize for , you constituted a danger to your neighbors and tried to acquire weapons of mass destruction and practiced dictatorship over your people and so it was only natural that we extended our hand to the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> to rid them of the perils which had confronted them for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</ENAMEX> than three decades .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : I know that you are ignorant of history , and I know that your president is no less ignorant but it seems that you have continued to lie to the extent that you now believe yourselves .
If " by our neighbors " you mean <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Zionist Entity</ENAMEX> then we did indeed form a danger , we were preparing to liberate our ravished territory in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> .
This is the wish of every <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> person and not just every <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> .
For this is <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> land and its people are <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Zionists</ENAMEX> are the ones who occupied the land and came to us from all over the world with your help , yours , and that of the old imperial powers .
But if you meant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> , I want to ask you .
Did you withdraw from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> or not ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : These are security issues .
Besides , there are security agreements between us and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Gulf</ENAMEX> states ... we came at their request to protect them from your threats .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : Is n't funny that the wolf is being entrusted with the sheep ?
The people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> are an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> people .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> territory , therefore I ask you to read history carefully , although I am certain that you wo n't comprehend it .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : Stop from this drivel , I am offering you ...
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> -LRB- interrupting -RRB- : Before you offer me your rotten goods , I ask you did you find weapons of mass destruction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> or not ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> -LRB- disconcerted -RRB- : We have n't found them yet , but we will surely find them <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> day .
Do you deny that you had intentions to manufacture a nuclear bomb ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : We have had no weapons of mass destruction since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> , we were truthful when we spoke with the international inspection mission , we were truthful in our letters to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kofi Annan</ENAMEX> , you knew these facts but you were looking for any pretext to occupy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and topple its legitimate authority .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> received us with overwhelming happiness and welcomed us , because of the practices of your bloody regime over the course of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">all those years</ENAMEX> in which you governed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : Please , Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> , enough lying .
You are the ones who have opened the floodgates to cascades of blood on the soil of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , you plotted against us and got some traitors to take over power over the land of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : Those you are calling traitors have been chosen by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> people as their leaders by democratic means and free elections , something that did not take place during your rule over the country .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : I found out that you had come with a troop of traitors led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talabani</ENAMEX> -LRB- laughs mockingly -RRB- .
Great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> is being ruled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talabani</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaafari</ENAMEX> .
Is n't this ridiculous ?
Then , which elections are you talking about ?
Is it permissible for what you call free elections to be held under your occupation of our country ?
Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> , we have learned from history that the occupier will not bring except his assistants and lackeys , and you want , after all that , to convince me that the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> enjoy freedom and democracy ?
You are truly delusional .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> -LRB- barely able to contain his anger -RRB- : You are isolated and do not know the facts of what is happening on the outside .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> people have been liberated from your oppression , if they saw you or any of your men in the street they would kill you .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : I challenge you to announce your location in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> if you can .
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> resistance found out your whereabouts you would not be able to get out alive .
I want to give a word of advice to your " dumb " president , you must pass it on to him , and it is that he should save what is left of his soldiers .
Death surrounds them everywhere and history will not be merciful to him .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : I came to talk with you about the terrorist operations which your men are instigating and carrying out .
Your men have recently carried out an ignoble operation aimed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Abu Ghraib</ENAMEX> prison where they injured and killed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than fifty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> and also killed a number of prisoners imprisoned under various charges .
Your men are employing terrorists from all parts of the world and they are threatening the democratic process in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : What is it you want exactly ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : I am making you <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> offer , that you are released and choose for yourself a place of exile in any country you wish on the condition that you appear on television to announce your condemnation of the terrorism and to ask your men to stop these practices .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : Have you obtained the consent of your president to this offer ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : Yes , this offer was agreed to at a session in which the President , his deputy , the Secretary of State and the head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> took part and I was commissioned to inform you of this offer .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : It is a very low price .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> -LRB- excited -RRB- : We are prepared to include elements close to you in power .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : And what else ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : We will offer you considerable financial assistance and will look after your and your family 's security in the country you choose .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : Do you want to hear my conditions ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : Yes , that would be nice .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> -LRB- in language beaming with pride and arrogance -RRB- I want you <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> of all .. to set me a timetable for the withdrawal from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> that your government will commit itself to it in front of the world , and for you to begin the withdrawal operation immediately .
I ask , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">secondly</ENAMEX> , .. for the immediate release of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> detainees in the prisons you have set up or in those where you have shackled the freedom of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</ENAMEX> of honorable <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Thirdly</ENAMEX> , I ask you .. for the undertaking that full compensation will be offered for the material losses which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> people have suffered through your aggression on our country since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Mother of All Battles</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this present day</ENAMEX> .
I will accept the assistance of an international and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> committee in estimating these losses .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourthly</ENAMEX> , I ask that you produce the money which your men looted from the treasuries of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and its oil especially this criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bremmer</ENAMEX> and his henchmen from the traitors and renegades .
And , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifthly</ENAMEX> , I ask for .. the return of the antiquities which you have stolen and handed over to the antiquities mafia , for these are priceless treasures because they bear the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and its civilization .
Your country is no older than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few hundred years</ENAMEX> .
True , you do not have neither a civilization nor history , but all that can not excuse your thefts and your hatred of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> 's civilization and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> 's riches .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Sixthly</ENAMEX> , I ask that you hand me the weapons of mass destruction if you have found them , bring back to life all the martyrs you have killed , and return the integrity of the glorious <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> women which you have robbed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : Is this some kind of joke ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : No , this is just the bitter truth , which you know very well .
Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> , you have committed the greatest crime in history against a peaceful <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> state .. we met each other in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighties</ENAMEX> .
Do you remember your offers ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : Let us forget <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</ENAMEX> , we are in the process of re-evaluating our position on you and on the many forces which displayed hostility to us in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</ENAMEX> .
We have decided to hold a dialogue with the moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamists</ENAMEX> .
We have no objection to their arrival in power via the ballot box .
But more importantly , we have decided to open channels of dialogue with " terrorist " organizations such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jihad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> who are loyal to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> , and other fundamentalist organizations in the whole world .
And we even have a project to get in touch with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> movement in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> to discuss its participation in power in return for disarming .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : Then you have begun to re-think your mistaken methodology .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : It is a natural development of things , we are trying to spread democracy to all countries and all autocratic movements .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : You would be successful if you would tell the truth .
I know the reality of your goals .
If you were really sincere you would begin straightaway , you and your allies , to withdraw from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , and you also have to back down from your position of supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> .
I know that your president is stubborn and obstinate and not sincere .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : He is a democratically elected president and not a bloodthirsty ruler like you .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : Terrorism is your trade and deceit your method .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : This proposal is an historic chance for you .
We will release you and will consult with you in everything concerning governance issues in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
If you reject this offer then the opportunity will not be repeated .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : I am not looking for opportunities , I am not looking for a way to save my neck from the gallows which you have set up for the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
If I wanted that I would have accepted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> offer and saved my <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sons and my grandson from martyrdom .
I do not know what the fate of my family and my daughters and grandchildren is , but be sure that I am concerned for every <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> citizen and the future of the Great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> more than I am concerned with myself and my family .
You have previously made me an offered before this through your men that I say the weapons of mass destruction were smuggled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> , and you said that the price was my release .
I refused and I repeat the refusal once again .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : I do not want a refusal from you , I want you to think about it .
We are currently re-evaluating our positions , we want to stop the bloodshed on both sides and so our offer is made from the point of strength and not from the point of weakness .
We asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalal Talabani</ENAMEX> to make a statement in which he denies any intention to execute you as a sign of good will from us .
We are ready to review our position completely on the entire political process in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and we will hold a dialogue with you and with your men on this matter .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussain</ENAMEX> : Are you ready to withdraw or not ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : We could discuss re-deployment , our forces have prepared bases for long - term stay .
We could withdraw from the streets and the towns but we will stay in the bases for a some time .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : Then you want a new lackey to be added to this queue of lackeys .
No Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> .. do n't forget that you are speaking with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> , the president of the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : But you have lost power .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : I have only honor left and honor can not be sold or bought .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : But life has a value that is priceless .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : There is no value to a life without honor , and you robbed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> of its honor when you desecrated its land .
We will get our honor back whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> survives or becomes a martyr .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : Your followers with whom we entered into a dialogue have told us that the decisions will be yours , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">last</ENAMEX> .
Were they expecting your reaction ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : For sure , they know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussain</ENAMEX> can not back down at the expense of his nation and its honor .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : History will hold you responsible for the blood which is being spilled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : On the contrary , history will judge you because of your crimes ..
I warned you in advance when I said to you that you will commit suicide on the walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> , and here you are paying the price .
I ask you to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> and read the records of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the British Foreign Office</ENAMEX> to find out some of the characteristics of the struggle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> people against your <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> friends whose mistakes you are repeating and making them participate with you .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> people are an obstinate people and do not fear death ... the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Resistance</ENAMEX> is stronger than you imagine and therefore I predict there 'll be more .

Details of the minutes of the meeting between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Airport Prison</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The Amateur</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> : We have nothing to apologize for .
You were a danger to your neighbors and tried to acquire weapons of mass destruction .
And you practiced dictatorship over your people .
and so it was natural that we extended our hand to the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> to rid them of the perils which had confronted them for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</ENAMEX> than three decades .
And did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> free <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> from dangers ?
He is really delusional ...
I have reservations about what appeared in these minutes ... because I think it unlikely that what happened at that meeting would leak out this easily ...
And I do not believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> would meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> unless <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> himself made signs ... the important thing is that the expression quoted above tells of a reality that can not be but accepted ...
May God the Great forgive me .

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qais the Son of His Father</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The Martyr of the Nation</ENAMEX> , God is his protector and we do not recommend anyone above God , ascended up the gallows walking straight , not with a bowed head , and he was treated to what -LRB- -LRB- the lackeys -RRB- -RRB- witnessed .
He disdained death and was not bothered by it , challenging the provocations of the imperialist donkeys with full self - control , repeating the words " There is no God but God and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX> is the messenger of God . "
After the sentence was carried out and his body was dangling in the air , his shoes were above the heads of the scum , the imperialist donkeys , those on whose backs the people of the cross are riding and who share the trenches with them to carry out the most despicable , vile and contemptible crime the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> world has know in our <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">current age</ENAMEX> .
.
-LRB- -RRB-
Exalted in life and in death **** verily , you are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the miracles
As if the people around you when they rose up **** delegations at your call in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the days of prayer</ENAMEX> .
As if you are standing amongst them addressing - **** and all of them are standing to pray
You extended your hands towards them in welcome **** just as you extended them towards them with gifts .
When the bowels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> became too tight to - **** confine your exaltedness after Death They made the air your tomb and they exchanged - **** for the shrouds the gown of the sandy winds
For Your Greatness in our souls grows and is tended - **** by guards and trustworthy confidents
May the Compassionate rain his blessings on you - ***** with mercies passing to and fro
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The Emirati</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> : I have nothing left but honor and honor can not be bought and sold .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The Collaborator</ENAMEX>
My brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qais , the Son of his Father</ENAMEX> , I thank you for your post and the addition , may God take care of you .
May your steps in doing good be like someone walking on sand ... he makes no sound but his tracks are obvious .
