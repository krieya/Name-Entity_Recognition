Well , sex abuse by priests remains an issue in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Catholic Church</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> and it is certain to be an issue as bishops gather <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX> for their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">semiannual</ENAMEX> meeting .
Under a charter approved <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Conference of Catholic Bishops</ENAMEX> , diocese officials will report allegations of sexual abuse of a minor to public authorities .
Past , present or future sexual abuse of a minor will lead to removal from the ministry .
No priest or deacons who sexually abuse a minor may be transferred to another diocese .
With me now to talk more about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Brien</ENAMEX> case and the divisions still dividing the church are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Blain</ENAMEX> , the founder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Survivors Network</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX> and also joining us from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Mayor</ENAMEX> , the founder of a priest support group .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara</ENAMEX> , to you <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> .
As the bishops get ready for this important meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> , are you satisfied that they have taken all the appropriate steps to deal with the abuse issue ?
