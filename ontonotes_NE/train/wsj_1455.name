Sitting at the bar of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Four Seasons</ENAMEX> restaurant , architect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William McDonough</ENAMEX> seems oblivious to the glamorous clientele and the elegant setting .
He is ogling the curtains rippling above the ventilation ducts .
`` Look how much air is moving around ! '' he says .
`` The ventilation here is great ! ''
You may be hearing more about the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">38 - year - old</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> and his preoccupation with clean air .
After years of relative obscurity , he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> believes that the well - being of the planet depends on such stratagems as opening windows to cut indoor air pollution , tacking down carpets instead of using toxic glues , and avoiding mahogany , which comes from endangered rain forests .
He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - star <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Quilted Giraffe</ENAMEX> restaurant -- `` architecturally impeccable , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Progressive Architecture</ENAMEX> magazine called it -- and his remodeling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paul Stuart</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Madison Avenue</ENAMEX> clothing store .
He has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space .
He is now designing a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX> stage set for a show by the band <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kid Creole and the Coconuts</ENAMEX> .
What really stirs his muse , though , is aerobic architecture .
Now the question is : Is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> ready for it ?
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> is about to tackle his biggest clean - air challenge yet , the proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Warsaw Trade Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> such center in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> .
The project has already acquired a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> cachet .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX> 's plans to sell a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">foot</ENAMEX> - tall chocolate model of the center during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the holidays</ENAMEX> .
Some of the sales proceeds will go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Design Industries Foundation</ENAMEX> for AIDS .
A cake topped with a replica of the center will be auctioned at an AIDS benefit at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> .
If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> 's plans get executed , as much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Polish</ENAMEX> center as possible will be made from aluminum , steel and glass recycled from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> 's abundant rubble .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> - story mesh spire will stand atop <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> stories of commercial space .
Solar - powered batteries will make the spire glow .
The windows will open .
The carpets wo n't be glued down , and walls will be coated with nontoxic finishes .
To the extent that the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</ENAMEX> budget will allow it , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> will rely on solid wood , rather than plywood or particle board , to limit the emission of formaldehyde .
If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> has his way , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Poles</ENAMEX> will compensate for the trade center 's emissions of carbon dioxide , a prime suspect in the global atmospheric warming many scientists fear .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Poles</ENAMEX> would plant a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 - square - mile</ENAMEX> forest somewhere in the country at a cost of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">150,000</ENAMEX> , with the center 's developer footing the bill .
The news has n't exactly moved others in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> 's profession to become architectural <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny Appleseeds</ENAMEX> .
All architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Burgee</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> firm is designing the redevelopment of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Times Square</ENAMEX> , `` but we ca n't all carry it to that extreme . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Nichols</ENAMEX> , senior associate at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Graves 's</ENAMEX> architecture firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Princeton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , says : `` We 're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> responds : `` I 'm asking people to broaden their agendas . ''
The son of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Seagram</ENAMEX> 's executive who was stationed in many countries around the world , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and attended <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</ENAMEX> schools in places ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shaker Heights</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , before entering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dartmouth College</ENAMEX> .
He earned a master 's degree in architecture from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yale</ENAMEX> .
His interest in the natural environment dates from his youth .
He and his father still spend time <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each summer</ENAMEX> fly - fishing for salmon in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iceland</ENAMEX> .
Living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , he says , made him sensitive to the limits on food , power and water supplies .
At his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> school in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> he was thought a little strange for shutting off open water taps and admonishing his schoolmates to take only brief showers .
He and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dartmouth</ENAMEX> roommate established a company that restored <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> hydroelectric power plants in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX> .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yale</ENAMEX> , he designed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> solarheated houses to be built in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> professional project fully to reflect his environmental ardor was his <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> design for the headquarters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Environmental Defense Fund</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
The offices took <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10,000 square feet</ENAMEX> of a building with <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 - foot</ENAMEX> ceilings and big , operable windows .
Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1970s</ENAMEX> energy crisis , some efforts to conserve energy by sealing buildings have had an unintended side effect : high indoor pollution .
To reduce it at the fund 's building , workers rubbed beeswax instead of polyurethane on the floors in the executive director 's office .
Jute , rather than a synthetic material , lies under the tacked - down carpets , and the desks are of wood and granite instead of plastic .
The budget was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 400,000</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Spartan</ENAMEX> means , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> says .
The fund 's lawyers work in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Athenian</ENAMEX> grove of potted trees .
Economists and administrators sit along a `` boulevard '' with street lamps and ficus trees .
In offices , triphosphorous bulbs simulate daylight .
Offices with outside windows have inside windows , too , to let in more real daylight .
`` We proved a healthy office does n't cost more , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederic Krupp</ENAMEX> , executive director of the fund .
It `` really looks beautiful and is very light , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann Hornaday</ENAMEX> , a free - lance writer who has visited the office for lunch meetings .
But , she says , `` I guess I did n't really notice the trees .
Maybe they were hidden by all the people . ''
Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Quilted Giraffe</ENAMEX> nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paul Stuart</ENAMEX> renovation reflects much of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> 's environmental concern .
The restaurant was conceived as a sparkling , crystalline `` geode . ''
It makes extensive use of stainless steel , silver and aluminum that sets off black granite table tops and a gray terrazzo with zinc - strip floors .
To more than replace the wood from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">English</ENAMEX> oaks used for paneling at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paul Stuart</ENAMEX> , however , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> and friends planted <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</ENAMEX> acorns around the country .
The ambitious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> project still awaits approval by city officials .
Its developer is <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">a Polish American</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sasha Muniak</ENAMEX> .
He had worked with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> on an earlier project and recruited him as architect for the trade center .
The center will provide space for computer hardware and facsimile and other telecommunications equipment , not readily accessible in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">now</ENAMEX> , for a growing number of Westerners doing business in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> thinks of the center as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the `` Eiffel Tower</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> '' and `` a symbol of the resurgence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> . ''
If any nation can use environmentally benign architecture , it is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Mathews</ENAMEX> , vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">World Resources Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> , says that perhaps a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quarter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> 's soil is too contaminated for safe farming because of air pollution .
The pollution is also killing forests and destroying buildings that date back to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</ENAMEX> .
The future of the forest remains uncertain .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muniak</ENAMEX> 's company , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Balag Ltd.</ENAMEX> , has agreed to set aside the money to plant and maintain it , but discussions are still going on over where to place it and how to ensure that it will be maintained .
After all , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muniak</ENAMEX> says , `` in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> there are n't too many people worried about the environment .
They 're more worried about bread on the table .
