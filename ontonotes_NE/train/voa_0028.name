<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least six</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> sailors were killed and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 30</ENAMEX> wounded , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> in an apparent suicide attack on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> warship in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VOA</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Belida</ENAMEX> reports from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pentagon</ENAMEX> .
The crew of destroyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS Cole</ENAMEX> had no reason to expect trouble when the ship pulled into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Aden Harbor</ENAMEX> for a brief routine refueling stop .
The crew , especially saw nothing to fear from a small support boat , sent out by harbor authorities to assist in the mooring process , but that small boat was apparently loaded with explosives and manned by suicide bombers .
As it pulled up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> destroyer , it blew up , tearing a gaping hole in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> 's side .
Admiral <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vern Clark</ENAMEX> , the Chief of Naval Operations , says there had been no threats or warnings ahead of the port call .
He says other recent refueling visits by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> ships to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> had gone off without incident .
Because of general concerns about security in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Mid East</ENAMEX> , armed guards had been posted on the ship 's deck .
Other standard safety and security measures were also being observed .
