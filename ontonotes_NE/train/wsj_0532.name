<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Price</ENAMEX> abruptly quit as president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MTM Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> production company that has fallen on hard times .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">61 years old</ENAMEX> , also stepped down from the board of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVS Entertainment PLC</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> TV company that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MTM</ENAMEX> , producer of such TV programs as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hill Street Blues</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</ENAMEX> . ''
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVS</ENAMEX> spokesman said he did n't know Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> 's plans .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Gatward</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVS</ENAMEX> 's chief executive , said in a statement that he will `` assume overall responsibility '' for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MTM</ENAMEX> 's operations until a successor is named .
Industry analysts speculated that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> 's sudden departure may have stemmed from conflicts with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gatward</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> `` wanted to run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MTM</ENAMEX> business '' and may have regretted selling the company to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVS</ENAMEX> , suggested <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Denton</ENAMEX> , managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Zenith Productions</ENAMEX> , a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Carlton Communications PLC</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> .

The <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 320 million</ENAMEX> purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MTM</ENAMEX> represented an audacious international move for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVS</ENAMEX> , which then was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> concern 's size .
At the time , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gatward</ENAMEX> said his friendship with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> had smoothed the way for its link with the small <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> company .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVS</ENAMEX> stunned industry analysts <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> by disclosing that it expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MTM</ENAMEX> to post an operating loss for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
In that announcement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVS</ENAMEX> also said it was trimming production finance and hiring a new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> sales manager .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gatward</ENAMEX> has spent a lot of time since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late September</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MTM</ENAMEX> 's headquarters ; he eliminated <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> departments and fired <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> executives , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVS</ENAMEX> spokesman .
Further staff cuts are likely , the spokesman indicated .
`` Obviously , we are looking at making economies across the board . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVS</ENAMEX> blames difficulties in peddling reruns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MTM</ENAMEX> shows to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> broadcasters for the problems at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MTM</ENAMEX> .
The market for reruns sold to local <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> broadcasters has been weak for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three or four seasons</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> co-founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MTM</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> actress <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Tyler Moore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grant Tinker</ENAMEX> , her then - husband .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tinker</ENAMEX> later left to become chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Broadcasting Co</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVS</ENAMEX> spokesman said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> still holds about an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVS</ENAMEX> stake , acquired as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MTM</ENAMEX> acquisition .
