At a private dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> chief executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Joseph</ENAMEX> delivered a sobering message about the junk bond market to officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential Insurance Co. of America</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> conceded the junk market was in disarray , according to people familiar with the discussion .
He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> -- the leading underwriter of high - risk junk bonds -- could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> risked losing its highly lucrative junk franchise .
The dinner was a stark confirmation that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the worst year ever</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 billion</ENAMEX> junk market .
And investors and traders alike say the current turmoil could take <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> to resolve .
Amid the market disorder , even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> , which has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond investors , is pulling in its horns .
Although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults , withdrawn new offerings , redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once - devoted investors .
For many money managers , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past four months</ENAMEX> have been humiliating .
`` This is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market , and it could take <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> before it 's over , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Bachmann</ENAMEX> , a senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Standard -AMP- Poor 's Corp.</ENAMEX> , a credit rating company .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third quarter</ENAMEX> , for example , junk bonds -- those with less than an investment - grade rating -- showed negative returns , the only major sector of the bond market to do so .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of last year</ENAMEX> , junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment - grade bonds , including ultra-safe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities .
The junk market , which mushroomed to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 billion</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 2 billion</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of the decade</ENAMEX> , has been declining for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> as issuers have stumbled under the weight of hefty interest payments .
The fragile market received its biggest jolt <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> , which created its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> retailing empire with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 3 billion</ENAMEX> in junk financing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campeau</ENAMEX> developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bloomingdale 's</ENAMEX> department store chain up for sale .
At that point , the junk market went into a tailspin as buyers disappeared and investors tried to sell .
In an interview , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> says his dinner discussion with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential</ENAMEX> executives acknowledged problems for junk .
`` What I thought I was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and , appropriately enough , quite quality - conscious , which is not at all bad , '' he says .
`` Nobody 's been perfect in their credit judgments <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past couple years</ENAMEX> , and we 're going to make sure our default rates are going to be in the acceptable parameters of the market . ''
What has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden realization that junk bonds can not necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment - grade bonds .
Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , where buyers and sellers are quickly matched , the junk market , where risky corporate loans are traded , is sometimes closed for repairs .
At closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Deltec Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> , junk bond money managers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy K. Minella</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannah H. Strasser</ENAMEX> say the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</ENAMEX> , they say , there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market 's traditional investors , while new buyers have n't materialized to replace them .
Wall Street securities firms , `` the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market , '' have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Deltec</ENAMEX> said in a recent , grim report to customers .
Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above - normal '' redemptions by shareholders , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Deltec</ENAMEX> said .
Investors , trying to raise cash , have sold `` large liquid issues '' such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RJR Holdings Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kroger Co.</ENAMEX> ; declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market 's distress .
And , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Deltec</ENAMEX> said , buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation .
`` In fact , savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Deltec</ENAMEX> said .
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minella</ENAMEX> and Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strasser</ENAMEX> say they are managing their junk portfolios defensively , building cash and selectively upgrading the overall quality .
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential</ENAMEX> , the nation 's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds , has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.5 billion</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 billion</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> because of falling junk prices .
`` We certainly do have a lack of liquidity here , and it 's something to be concerned about , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James A. Gregoire</ENAMEX> , a managing director .
`` I have no reason to think things will get worse , but this market has a knack for surprising us .
This market teaches us to be humble . ''
The junk market 's `` yield hogs are learning a real painful lesson , '' he says .
Although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default , the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Reese</ENAMEX> , manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Aetna Life -AMP- Casualty Insurance Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 billion</ENAMEX> investment - grade public bond portfolio .
`` But we think the risks are there for things getting a lot worse .
And the risks are n't appropriate for us , '' he says .
The big insurer , unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential</ENAMEX> , owns <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only about $ 150 million</ENAMEX> of publicly sold junk bonds .
The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , probably will persist , some analysts say .
`` If anything , we 're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Asquith</ENAMEX> , associate professor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sloan School of Management</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asquith</ENAMEX> , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last April</ENAMEX> , says this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings .
His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> indication of a growing number of junk defaults , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asquith</ENAMEX> says , is that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</ENAMEX> of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">S-AMP-P</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> are junk bonds sold during the market 's big issue <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years of 1984 through 1986</ENAMEX> .
These bonds , now rated single - D , include junk offerings by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AP Industries</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbia Savings</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Texas Savings Association</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gilbraltar Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Integrated Resources Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Resorts International Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Southmark Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vyquest Inc</ENAMEX> .
`` Obviously , we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market was n't so risky , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradford Cornell</ENAMEX> , professor of finance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">University of California 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Anderson Graduate School of Management</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornell</ENAMEX> has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment - grade bonds .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornell</ENAMEX> says : `` The junk market is no bonanza as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> claimed , but it also is n't a disaster as the doomsayers say . ''
Despite the junk market 's problems , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its Wall Street rivals have n't found .
During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three weeks</ENAMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> has sold <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</ENAMEX> of new junk bonds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Turner Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Uniroyal Chemical</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Continental Air</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Duff -AMP- Phelps</ENAMEX> .
Still , the list of troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> bond offerings dwarfs that of any firm on Wall Street , as does its successful offerings .
Troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> - underwritten issues include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Resorts International</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Braniff</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Integrated Resources</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gillette Holdings</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Western Electric</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Southmark</ENAMEX> .
`` Quality junk bonds will continue to trade well , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Holland</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc</ENAMEX> .
`` But the deals that never should have been brought have now become nuclear waste .
