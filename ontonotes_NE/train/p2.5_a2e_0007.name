The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> peninsula is characterized by a great deal of tribal variety and each of these tribes has its own way of receiving guests and preparing feasts .
It might resemble some other tribes or be unique to them and some brothers may be surprised , especially local residents attending feasts , particularly if it is in their ' stronghold ' , i.e. the area they live in .
Among these customs , some of which we have seen and some of which we have heard about , I 'll describe a few and I look forward to people expressing their opinions to enrich the subject so that we can all learn about these customs .
For example , some tribes will only eat after the guest has eaten and will only finish after he finishes , even if he stays for a full hour .
Some get angry if the slaughtered animal which they have been honored with contains certain parts such as the neck , for example , or that you eat the tongue of the slaughtered animal .
Some will offer you food then leave you and your family to eat alone .
Some will turn off the lights so that you feel more comfortable when eating your food and so that you do n't feel as if someone is watching you , in addition to many other customs .
And perhaps there are even stranger customs other than the ones mentioned when you send in your comments on the subject .
So see you .
