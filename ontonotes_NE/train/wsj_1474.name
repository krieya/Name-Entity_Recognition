High - definition television promises to be the TV of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> , so it is a natural <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">multibillion - dollar</ENAMEX> market .
Although major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , not everyone here is ready to give up .
A handful of small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> companies are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin , high - quality televisions that are expected to hang on living room walls by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 1990s</ENAMEX> .
With only small help from the government , these start - up concerns are trying to compete with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goliaths</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> consumer electronics industry , which enjoy considerable backing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> government .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Photonics Technology Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northwood</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie - quality images on a TV display that is <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 inches</ENAMEX> in diameter but <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a few inches</ENAMEX> thick .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Planar Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beaverton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ore.</ENAMEX> , the largest of these firms , with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> revenue , has similar plans .
It already has had success in electroluminescence , another promising technology adaptable for high - definition television .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> other firms , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Troy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Magnascreen Corp. of Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> are developing a variation of the flat - panel screens called active - matrix liquid crystal displays .
The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode - ray tube , which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set .
Replacing the cathode - ray tube with a large , thin screen is the key to the creation of a high - definition television , or HDTV , which is expected to become a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 billion</ENAMEX> business world - wide within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</ENAMEX> .
Large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business , such as signal - processing and broadcast equipment .
But except for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Zenith Electronics Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> , which is collaborating with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toshiba</ENAMEX> on computer displays , they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> recently sold off its interests in liquid - crystal displays to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Thompson - CSF</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> .
`` We found the market not developing as we thought it would , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> spokesman says .
The small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> firms are persisting because of their strong positions in patents , and because the prize is still there to be seized .
`` No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels '' at commercial costs , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zvi Yaniv</ENAMEX> , the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ovonic Imaging</ENAMEX> .
He says he thinks his company is just <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</ENAMEX> from doing that .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration , hearing conflicting advice about what its role in HDTV should be , is n't doing much for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">now</ENAMEX> .
The only material support it is extending to the struggling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> industry is <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</ENAMEX> in awards from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DARPA</ENAMEX> funds are a pittance compared with what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and other prospective competitors are spending .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Commerce Department</ENAMEX> estimates that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> government and industry spending on HDTV research is already over <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> .
`` Unless it gets more help , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> industry wo n't have a chance , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Friedman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Photonics</ENAMEX> 's executive vice president .
Thus far , almost all of the basic technology relating to high - definition television has come from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> laboratories .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Brody</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Magnascreen</ENAMEX> 's president , says <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use , just as they did with earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> innovations in color television and video recording .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brody</ENAMEX> helped develop the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> display panels based on active - matrix liquid crystals at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse Electric Corp. 's</ENAMEX> research labs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> .
The panels are like oversized semiconductors surfaced with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million or more</ENAMEX> picture elements , each contributing to the color and tone of a TV image .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</ENAMEX> , however , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> abandoned the project along with its stake in advanced television .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brody</ENAMEX> left the company to find other backers .
He has a claim to the right to commercialize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> patents , but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> producers .
`` Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> investors have just given up , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brody</ENAMEX> says .
`` They are n't prepared to compete in an area where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> want to enter . ''
Many critics question the industry 's need for federal support ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> justifies its help on national - security grounds .
`` We do n't see a domestic source for some of our -LCB- HDTV -RCB- requirements , and that 's a source of concern , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kelly</ENAMEX> , director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DARPA</ENAMEX> 's defense manufacturing office .
So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DARPA</ENAMEX> is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds .
HDTV already has some military applications , such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> is ordering displays for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Aegis</ENAMEX> cruisers and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Army</ENAMEX> wants smaller versions for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Abrams</ENAMEX> battle tanks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Commerce Department</ENAMEX> also is trying to encourage HDTV because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries .
`` It is n't just yuppie television , '' argues <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Clifford</ENAMEX> , director of the department 's office of microelectronics and instrumentation .
`` The industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market . ''
Although some HDTV advocates are calling for other forms of aid , such as antitrust relief for research consortia , the small firms simply would prefer more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DARPA</ENAMEX> funds .
Each claims to possess the right technology and wants just a bit more money to make it commercial .
They also want <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade policy to reflect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Commerce</ENAMEX> department 's concern over their future .
They all are strongly opposed to a petition from several <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> TV manufacturers , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Matsushita</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hitachi</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toshiba</ENAMEX> , to exempt portable color TVs with liquid - crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> imposes on the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> color TVs .
And they want the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> to help them sell overseas .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Planar</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Hurd</ENAMEX> says he has to pay tariffs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as 15 %</ENAMEX> to sell his display panels in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> , while panels from those countries enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> duty - free .
`` This is n't a technology issue , but an attitude issue , '' he says .
`` We just have n't learned what it takes to compete .
