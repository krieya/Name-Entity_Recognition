On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 26th of last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the " Hubei Daily "</ENAMEX> released a group of articles , naming and criticizing a comrade at a village broadcasting station for fabricating a news release , " <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guofu Ba</ENAMEX> hits a roadblock " .
It also released an editorial article pointing out that sticking to principles of authenticity in news reporting is an excellent tradition in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Party</ENAMEX> journalism .
Similar false and partially false news items have been seen not only in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the " Hubei Daily "</ENAMEX> , but also other newspapers , TV and radio have had such news .
Although false news is rare , the influence is extremely bad .
If there is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> false piece of news out of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> pieces , readers will suspect the other <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</ENAMEX> pieces .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Chinese Communist Party</ENAMEX> is a party that maintains the principle of being practical and realistic .
Party journalism should also follow the principle of being practical and realistic .
Regardless of whether you are a professional journalist or an amateur , regardless of whether reporting good news or reporting bad news , all of it needs to be true .
There are a lot of reasons for causing news to be inconsistent with facts , most are subjective reasons .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The " Hubei Daily "</ENAMEX> published that comrade 's self - criticism .
He said , " In order to get a good appraisal at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</ENAMEX> , I changed the time and place of incidents which happened or I had witnessed in the past , and fudged such scenarios as ' the director general of revenue insists on giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guofu Ba</ENAMEX> a reward of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 yuan</ENAMEX> ' and ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guofu Ba 's</ENAMEX> child was ill and needed money urgently ' , etc . "
His desire for being appraised well is understandable , but should have taken the right road .
Moreover , press organizations should strictly check , and especially look out for those " related articles " .
So , to punish false news , some practical measures must be taken , exposing it in the papers is very effective .
False news can fool readers for a period of time , but eventually the writers fool themselves .
