After more than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</ENAMEX> of silence , a new collection of stories from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang Chun - ming</ENAMEX> is a major event , and not just in literary circles .
For readers who have been anticipating a new collection for years , the publication of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Letting Them Go</ENAMEX> is big news .
After such a long " hibernation , " how does this new work compare to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> 's previous works ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sinorama</ENAMEX> invited the literary critic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Chao</ENAMEX> to provide our readers with the in - depth review which follows .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang Chun - ming 's</ENAMEX> use of fiction to express his concern for the elderly has a long history .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cheng - tsai Gets off the Bus</ENAMEX> , " <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> 's earliest published work , is the tale of an elderly woman taking her grandson to the city to visit her daughter and son - in - law .
Although she is " only <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50</ENAMEX> , " " her withered face was deeply etched by life and the passage of time . . . giving people the impression that she was in her <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">60s</ENAMEX> . "
What really marks her as elderly is not her visage , however , but her inability to carry out a task as simple as catching a bus into the city , and the apprehensive feelings she harbors towards the " cold , unfamiliar " city and the unknown future .
Rural aesthetics
The title of " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">An Irrational Old Man</ENAMEX> " makes it plain that it too is a story about an elderly person .
Here , however , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> has written about a different sort of senior citizen , one who carries within himself a traditional wisdom uncorrupted by modern education .
This wisdom , extremely practical in nature , is part of a piecemeal oral tradition .
It is non-systematic and lacks mechanisms with which to check its own validity .
Nonetheless , when taken as a whole it presents the ideas that there are spirits in the earth and sky , and that the universe is an organic and connected whole .
This is the elderly 's perspective on the universe , and it gives them very different ideas about meaning and beauty .
In dialogue with his grandson <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ah - ming</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the " Irrational Old Man "</ENAMEX> passes on his old knowledge : listen to the sound of the waves the wind makes in the rice paddies to discover if the rice is ripe ; fill the bellies of grasshoppers with salt before grilling them ; sparrows are ghosts or spirits which understand human speech ; and killing the lu ti bird brings floods .
At the end , the old man tells the boy of the spirit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Choshui River</ENAMEX> , which searches for people to take its place .
In " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">An Irrational Old Man</ENAMEX> , " the reader feels very strongly that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang Chun - ming</ENAMEX> is playing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> roles : that of a little boy listening intently to his grandfather and that of a mature author who longs for the past and wishes to give voice to its earthy old knowledge .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ah - sheng</ENAMEX> is the unforgettable elderly protagonist of " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Drowning an Old Cat</ENAMEX> , " the next story in the collection .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ah - sheng</ENAMEX> does n't have the life of ease of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the " Irrational Old Man</ENAMEX> , " and he stubbornly resists the encroachment of his enemy , modern life .
In this tragic story , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ah - sheng</ENAMEX> is ultimately steamrollered by the massive momentum of the new .
But while the tragedy plays itself out , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> makes it clear to the reader that he stands firmly on the side of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ah - sheng</ENAMEX> in this conflict .
Not everything in the story is bleak , however .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> includes several comic and even farcical scenes , one of which occurs during a carnivalesque town meeting .
There , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ah - sheng</ENAMEX> demonstrates a startling ability to respond to circumstances and succeeds in wrecking the meeting hall as he makes an eloquent speech on the love of one 's family and birthplace , making " the entire village jump to its feet in agitation . "
And there is a farcical moment at the end as he takes off his clothes and jumps into a private swimming pool , making the ultimate protest by taking his own life .
Old people " let go " by the modern era
This theme of tragedy resulting from changing times has appeared in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> 's earlier work , in " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cymbal</ENAMEX> , " for example , which was strongly influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu Xun 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Story of Ah Q</ENAMEX> .
In " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cymbal</ENAMEX> , " the age of the protagonist , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foolish Chin</ENAMEX> , is unclear , but the theme of obsolescence remains .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chin</ENAMEX> 's work - making announcements in the street while using a cymbal to attract attention - has been made obsolete by the spread of the megaphone , undercutting his social status and taking away his livelihood .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chin</ENAMEX> thus takes on the role of a member of the older generation who has lost his struggle to make the transition to modern reality .
Of necessity , his misfortune and his way of thinking have a very " old ' character .
There are reasons to look back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> 's early work .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> is to point out that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Letting Them Go</ENAMEX> - in which the protagonist of every story is an elderly person - is entirely of a piece with his other work .
In fact , it is a return to the main thread of his concerns of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years ago</ENAMEX> .
In the extremely nationalistic atmosphere of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1970s</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> changed his focus for a time , writing about the hatred of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> -LRB- Sayonara , Goodbye -RRB- and about anti-American sentiments -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">I Love Mary</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Although well received at the time they were written , these works were flawed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , they lacked the fine composition of true literature .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</ENAMEX> , in them <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> had moved away from his greatest strength , the characters and settings with which he was truly familiar .
As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1970s</ENAMEX> writings were simply records of the period in which they were written and creative experiments .
They are interesting in their own way , but are by no means among his best works .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> generations removed
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> reason to look back at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> 's early fiction is to highlight the continuity of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Letting Them Go</ENAMEX> .
Although it has been more than ten years since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> 's last collection of fiction , and in spite of the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">37 years</ENAMEX> separate <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">" Cheng - tsai Gets off the Bus "</ENAMEX> and " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ticket Window</ENAMEX> , " there is something at the core of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> 's fiction which has not changed .
In his introduction to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Letting Them Go</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> mentions his deep distress at the plight of the elderly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">today</ENAMEX> , notes that he himself is just beginning to enter his twilight years , and compares <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's callous treatment of the elderly to the way in which the elderly were left to live or die on their own in the mountains in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">You Shan Jie Kao</ENAMEX> .
All of this could very easily give the reader the mistaken impression that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> 's vision of the elderly is a new development .
But this is simply not the case .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Letting Them Go</ENAMEX> , what we are actually seeing is the rebirth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> 's original passion .
If there has been any change in his portrayal of old people over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 37 years</ENAMEX> , it is only in perspective .
He used to write of grandfathers from the point of view of grandsons .
Now he is a grandfather himself .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang Chun - ming</ENAMEX> has often discussed the fact that he was raised largely by his grandparents , and that he had an unusually close relationship to them .
This background accounts for the unique " generation gap " approach utilized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> in his fiction .
Each of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> 's works describes a particular person or thing , and has an " implied reader " at which it is directed .
In the past , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> 's " generation gap " separated him from the people he was writing about - people of his grandparents ' generation , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> generations removed from his own .
Now , this " generation gap " stands between him and the " implied reader " of his fiction - children of his grandchildren 's generation who are ignorant of traditional wisdom .
Another aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> 's work is that it presents many of the characteristics sociology attributes to relationships between people <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> generations removed from one another .
For example , such relationships are not usually as tense , direct or hurried as those between parents and children because grandparents are not as busy as parents , and have less responsibility to supervise and teach .
Also , difficulties in communication between grandparents and grandchildren frequently arise because of the very different modes of expression employed by each .
As a result , there are typically more miscommunications in such relationships than there are between parents and their children .
A soft heart
Viewing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> 's fiction in this way , we can perhaps more clearly see wherein lies its charm .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> is never derisive or critical of his elderly characters .
If we compare him to other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nativist</ENAMEX> writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nativist</ENAMEX> writers use stories of suffering and pitiable elderly persons to make the case for reform .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> takes a much gentler approach - not because he thinks the modern world a perfect place , but because he can not bear to be so harsh .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> 's tender - heartedness is apparent to the reader of his work .
In his fiction , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> is both more sensitive to and places greater importance on the elderly 's haphazard means of expressing affection than are other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nativist</ENAMEX> writers .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fish</ENAMEX> , " one of his early works , has become very widely known since being incorporated into the national middle - school literature curriculum .
The story describes an unexpected conflict that arises out of a misunderstanding between a child and a grandfather who care deeply for one another .
Similar sorts of emotions are expressed in " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Letting Them Go</ENAMEX> " as well .
In this later story , the elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ah - wei</ENAMEX> inexplicably goes out and catches an egret , then just as inexplicably lets it go .
Both of these actions are indirect expressions of a deep love he can not give voice to yet nonetheless feels for his son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wen - tung</ENAMEX> .
A smile and a tear
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> writes of sad events , his readers ' eyes really do fill with tears .
However , the most exceptional thing about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> as a writer is that he is not satisfied with making his readers cry .
He wants every tear that falls to be accompanied by a small smile .
And he is able to have it both ways because of the deep and tender sympathy of his work .
The stories in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Letting Them Go</ENAMEX> are filled with elderly characters .
Some are ignorant and suffer , like the old woman of " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cheng - tsai Gets off the Bus</ENAMEX> . "
But more of them are , like the protagonist of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the " Irrational Old Man</ENAMEX> , " full of a wisdom unsuited to the times in which they live .
Their tragedy is that they are out of step with the times , that they do not know how to adapt to this cold and chaotic new society .
The comedy of their predicament grows out of their unwillingness to let go of the " old " wisdom and " old " ways that they have treasured for so long , out of their flaunting of this " old " knowledge , and out of their use of their " old " assumptions to guess their way through the " new " world .
Their guesses are all wrong , of course , but in their creation of misunderstanding upon misunderstanding , we see a different kind of dignity .
And in this " old " wisdom and these " old " ways , we also see a light that time can not dim .
