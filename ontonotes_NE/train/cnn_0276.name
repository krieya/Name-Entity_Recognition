Journalists held a candle light vigil in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> mourning the deaths of their colleagues .
Military fire killed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> journalists in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Al Jazeera</ENAMEX> cameraman and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Spanish</ENAMEX> television .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Al Jazeera</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> deliberately targeted its facilities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Central Command</ENAMEX> denies that .
They say they were being used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> military .
Here 's how the network covered the incidents in this translated report .
Translator :
Many inquiries about the developments of shelling the media positions , why in whose interest is in targeting .
The interest is targeting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Al Jazeera</ENAMEX> office and the tanks went on shelling the office , which resulted in the martyrdom of colleague from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Al Jazeera</ENAMEX> and others .
The next hit , in fact , targeted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Abu Dhabi</ENAMEX> office which is also very close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Al Jazeera</ENAMEX> surned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> forces .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> hit was targeted to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Palestine Hotel</ENAMEX> where many journalists are working and a hit of a photographer .
A specialist .
People think the events are not put the media man in face of the weapons .
Looking for a shelter is not easy .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and cooperation do not appreciate the city and others .
Everyone , in fact , is facing this threat .
That report from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Al Jazeera</ENAMEX> through a translator , how they 're reporting this story and the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> journalists who were killed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> in that tank shell were killed at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Palestine Hotel</ENAMEX> .
That 's been a base for international journalists in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> .
Both of the dead were camera men one with reporters and one with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> journalists were wounded in that same incident .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">A Central Command</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> forces were responding to what they described as , quote , significant fire coming at them from inside the hotel .
Joining me here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait City</ENAMEX> a journalist who knows first hand the dangers of covering war , our chief international correspondent , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christian A Manpower</ENAMEX> .

<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> separate locations .

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> has been essentially all over the place .
The military spokesmen have been all over the map in --
