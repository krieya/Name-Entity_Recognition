The `` seismic '' activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">earth</ENAMEX> .
When things are quiet -LRB- low volatility -RRB- , the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately .
However , when powerful forces start shaking the market 's structure , the more `` earthquake - resistant '' it is , the better its chance for survival .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required to make them fully `` aftershock - resistant . ''
Investors lack equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information .
That structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity .
And liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's markets , specialists -LRB- on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> -RRB- and `` upstairs '' market makers -LRB- in the over - the - counter market -RRB- are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price - determination process .
When they halt trading , all market liquidity is gone .
And when any component of the market -- cash , futures or options -- loses liquidity , the price discovery system -LRB- the way prices are determined -RRB- becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last Friday the 13th</ENAMEX> -LRB- as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago this week</ENAMEX> -RRB- the markets became unlinked .
When that happened , `` seismic '' tremors of fear -- much like the shock waves created by an earthquake -- coursed through the market and increased the market 's volatility .
Lack of important , needed information can cause fear .
Fear is the father of panic .
Panic frequently results in irrational behavior .
And in financial markets , irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe .
When market tremors start , it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply - demand curve -LRB- buy and sell orders at various prices -RRB- be made available to all , not just to market makers .
Because of a lack of information and access , many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed , because of their ignorance of important market information .
To add aftershock - damping power to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's markets , a modern , electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena -LRB- and the information that would automatically accompany such access -RRB- by investors -- particularly institutional investors .
Contrary to some opinions , the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole .
What market makers provide is immediacy , a very valuable service .
Liquidity is not a service .
It is a market attribute -- the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news .
Market makers buy what investors wish to sell ; their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors , and at a profit .
As a result , while any <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> customer may purchase immediacy by selling to a market maker -LRB- which is micro-liquidity for the investor -RRB- , the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction : The unwanted position is still an unwanted position ; only the identity of the seller has changed .
In fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers -LRB- a result of some <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">post-1987</ENAMEX> crash studies -RRB- also increases market volatility , since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time , the more selling pressure is overhanging the market .
In an open electronic system , any investor wishing to pay for real - time access to the trading arena through a registered broker - dealer would be able to see the entire supply - demand curve -LRB- buy and sell orders at each price -RRB- entered by dealers and investors alike , and to enter and execute orders .
Current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants -- not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk - averse during times of crisis .
Investors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> sought and called a `` national market system '' -LRB- not yet achieved -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">almost 15 years ago</ENAMEX> when it passed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Securities Reform Act</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last Friday 's</ENAMEX> market gyrations did not result in severe `` aftershocks . ''
Were we smart or just lucky ?
I 'm not certain .
But I am sure we need to maximize our `` earthquake '' protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty shock - damping power to our nation 's markets .
