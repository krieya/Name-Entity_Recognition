I just got back from the gym .
oh good .
uh-huh .
How 's it going ?
oh pretty well .
It was really crowded <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
yeah .
I kind of assumed everyone would be at the shore .
uh-huh .
I was wrong .
Well it 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the week</ENAMEX> or whatever
so .
But it 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth of July</ENAMEX> .
%mm .
So .
yeah .
People have to work <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> .
Do you have to work <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> ?
yeah .
Did you have off <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> ?
Yes .
oh that 's good .
And I was paid too .
oh .
Is it paid <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> ?
No .
oh .
But %uh
yeah ,
so the gym 's going well .
oh .
But I still need to go more often .
Well how often are you going ?
Only four days a week .
.
yeah .
Got to get that up to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> .
%mm .
But , I do n't really like going with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Marie</ENAMEX> because she does n't like to stay very long .
Why ?
I do n't know .
She kind of ,
well unfortunately for some reason she 's not like into cardio vascular .
So when I 'm still riding the bike she 's completely finished her weight lifting e- , routine .
mhm .
And like I have n't even started mine . mhm . You know
and I kind of hinted to her that really the only way to lose weight is cardio vascular . mhm . It 's true . And that lifting the weights wo n't lose weight .
%mm %mm .
You wo n't lose it , you know ,
but
No
I mean you might lose some
but that 's only when yo- .
For a woman who is lifting not that much I do n't think yeah . You would .
I mean yeah
I mean the only thing is %um just getting your heart rate up for extended periods of time .
yeah ,
So I do n't know
maybe she 'll catch on soon .
You do burn a lot of calories an hour though , lifting weights .
uh-huh .
But %uh
yeah
I mean you 're not going to , I do n't think you 're going to lose that much .
n- , and also lifting weights at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bally 's</ENAMEX> means you 're standing on line as for as much time as you 're actually lifting .
Really .
yeah .
That 's too bad .
yeah .
So it 's is it really overcrowded ?
Well , I mean obviously since I work I ca n't get there until <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">about six o'clock</ENAMEX> at night which is when everyone else gets there .
mhm .
mhm .
But I me- I 'm sure for people who go in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the daytime</ENAMEX> it 's probably dead . yeah . You know
and I go %um , like when I go <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Saturday and Sunday mornings</ENAMEX> it 's totally dead .
mhm .
So
But you know <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the weeknights</ENAMEX> is pretty crazy .
yeah .
yeah
I found a gym <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> here that 's only <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">eight pounds</ENAMEX> a month which is like <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">twelve dollars</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifty</ENAMEX>
oh yeah .
Wow .
yeah .
It 's at the hospital nearby .
Well that 's a deal .
yeah .
yeah .
So uh-huh . I think %um <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX> and I are going to go over and join up .
Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX> 's going to join ?
No ,
but it has to be debited from a bank account so it 's got to be debited from his .
yeah .
In your letter you said that he eats constantly .
oh my god .
Really ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX> , I 've never seen anybody eat as much as he does
and he 's so skinny .
mhm .
I mean the amount of cereal he eats like between meals and after meals
yeah .
and we go through a box of cereal <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">every two days</ENAMEX> .
Really ?
yeah .
Wow .
He eats at least like <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> of cereal a day like in addition to like meals .
uh-huh
And when he goes to work he brings <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> sandwiches with him , uh-huh . a bag of potato chips uh-huh . %um and you know and then little sweetie things chocolates and **cakies** and stuff like that .
uh-huh
And then you know before he leaves every morning he has like <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> fried eggs mhm on toast with cheese %um vegetarian sausages %um and like like fruit
and oh my god it 's just crazy .
mhm .
It 's crazy how much he eats .
He was probably starving when he was here .
yeah .
I think what we got to do is just when he comes just have lots of cereal .
He likes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cocoa Pops</ENAMEX> .
oh boy .
Wow .
That 's pretty crazy .
yeah .
It 's all about being a blue collar man .
I guess so .
They 're the ones who can eat <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">all day</ENAMEX> .
Really ?
Well I mean he does work his ass off
so
yeah .
But %uh 291.01_291.28_B: %hm .
%hm .
So , I , I assume it 's hard for you not to eat as much as he does .
No .
I learned quick fast in a hurry because I 've gained so much weight .
oh really ?
yeah .
Actually in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first week</ENAMEX> I was here -- mhm . -- I gained a lot
so .
Well it 's hard to you know not eat when so- , when somebody else is eating .
Well I 'm figuring it out fast because -- okay -- with not working out and all yeah . it 's pretty miserable my , my crunch tape .
%mm .
So I called this woman <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX>
and %um , she 's a dressmaker
and we 're going to go see her <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next Thursday</ENAMEX> and talk about the , her making my wedding dress .
Slate green .
yeah .
%uh .
See , that way I can have exactly what I want .
Exactly .
And it 's only like , it 's only going to be <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about two hundred and fifty pounds</ENAMEX> which is <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about three hundred and fifty dollars</ENAMEX> .
uh-huh .
So it 's pretty good I mean comparatively .
yeah .
And it 'll be exactly what I want
and it 'll look good on me , you know like fit me , Sure . which is necessary at the moment because I 'm plump
so .
mhm .
Now , daddy got %um the invitations together for you <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
uh-huh .
And in it I put , %um paint samples from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sherwin Williams</ENAMEX> uh-huh . of all the different like shades of what color I thought you might be thinking of for the bride 's maids .
uh-huh .
oh I already told them all black
but dad does n't want black he said .
Mom and dad wo n't have black .
They do n't want black ?
They 're really o- opposed to it .

<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> uh-huh . <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> uh-huh . <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">O</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> .
okay .
okay .
I 'll do that .
But %uh ,
yeah ,
apparently like at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Manachi 's</ENAMEX> wedding like <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the whole night</ENAMEX> people were talking about how bad the black dresses were .
Really ?
Like everyone at mom and dad 's table .
yeah .
Who was at mom and dad 's table ?
Weirdo
All the , just all of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorraine</ENAMEX> 's friends . mhm . Who you know o- , of course most of them mom and dad had at least met once before .
mhm .
But %uh
yeah ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adele</ENAMEX> still talks about the black dress .
What ?
How hideous they were .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adele</ENAMEX> was n't at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Manachi 's</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adele</ENAMEX> went to the mass wedding .
She did ?
uh-huh .
oh .
And she wanted me to take her
and I refused to go
and she got mad .
Really ?
Well I said , I said I , I would not feel comfortable going .
I was not invited . mhm . You know
and mom and dad were like well you know a wedding that 's a mass is open to everyone .
I was like well that 's fine
but I do n't , I would not feel comfortable going .
mhm .
I think that would be obnoxious
and I think they would then feel guilty for not inviting me .
Right .
To the -- -- you know the other thing , the reception .
I wo n't , I just would n't go .
%mm .
So they had to take it down and drive her home .
%mm .
So they 're always kind of pissy at me .
%mm . That 's okay .
yeah .
yeah .
I mean I 've been thinking about it
and the black 's not going to be so hot you know
but
mhm .
yeah .
Apparently they were also carrying lillies which is kind of goofy .
yeah .
Well I guess she did that to , because someone suggested that to her because you know the lillies the symbol of the virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> .
mhm .
White lillies ?
White lillies and black dresses .
%mm , my goodness .
That 's funny .
yeah .

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adele</ENAMEX> was carrying on that she thought she was at a funeral
and she had to keep reminding herself .

-- and she 's telling me about you know her sister 's wedding .
And at her sister 's wedding they %uh , they provided champagne and beer .
But if you wanted any other kind of drink you had to pay for it .
mhm .
