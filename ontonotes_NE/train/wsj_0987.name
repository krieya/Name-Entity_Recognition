<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> told a congressional subcommittee that he would consider imposing `` circuit breakers '' to halt program trading at volatile times .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> , in his first testimony to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> since taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> post , said the agency is studying the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday the 13th</ENAMEX> market plunge , including how current circuit breakers affected the market <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</ENAMEX> and the following <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
After the study , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> would be willing to consider adding new circuit breakers or fine - tuning the current ones , he added .
Circuit breakers , designed to give the markets a breather in cases of sharp price movements , curb trading of futures or stocks at various trigger points .
At certain points during the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday the 13th</ENAMEX> drop , circuit breakers kicked in on the futures market , slowing trading at times .
A circuit breaker that would have closed down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> was n't tripped .
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Markey</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee</ENAMEX> , is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer - driven program trading in hopes that would curb `` turmoil '' in the marketplace .
He argued that program - trading by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 15</ENAMEX> big institutions is pushing around the markets and scaring individual investors .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> did n't reject the proposal .
After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> study of the drop is completed , he said , `` I 'm perfectly happy to work with this committee ... in identifying whether we need other devices , '' such as a program - trading curb .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> backed most of the provisions in a market - reform bill that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> brought to the subcommittee <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> under then - chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Ruder</ENAMEX> .
The measure is expected to move through this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> .
But the new chairman vehemently opposed a provision in the bill that would give the agency the right to close the markets at times of stress .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> contended that uncertainty over when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> might act could worsen volatility in the markets .
He argued that the current circuit - breaker system allows investors to know `` precisely when and where any trading interruptions will occur and how long they will last . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> offered strong support for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> other provisions in the bill .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> would force brokerage houses to provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> detailed information about loans made by their holding companies .
Such loans often are used to finance leveraged buy - outs , and the agency is worried that a sharp market drop could create capital problems for the firms .
He also backed a rule to require large traders to report transactions on a systematic basis .
That information , he argued , is critical to reconstructing sharp market moves , such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ago</ENAMEX> .
