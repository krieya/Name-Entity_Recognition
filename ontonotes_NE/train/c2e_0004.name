" Appeal from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communist</ENAMEX> " and " Death " Threat to the Reporter .
An Appeal from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">communist</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Fenghua Garden</ENAMEX> community .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Fenghua Garden</ENAMEX> residents : .
Weird things have persisted since we moved into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Fenghua Garden</ENAMEX> .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past years</ENAMEX> , the media , procuratorate , court and government are all involved in the issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Fenghua Garden</ENAMEX> .
Instead of any solutions to the issue , we can vaguely see all sorts of mysteries of politics .
This gives us nothing but confusions and concerns .
How could there be such a weird phenomenon under the communist leadership ?
We are puzzled !
After seeing the remarks of an auditor - general , I am finally a little enlightened on the mysteries of the " <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Fenghua Garden</ENAMEX> phenomenon . "
The insightful opinion of this insightful person is indeed penetrating , " there is no law - abiding community association in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xuzhou</ENAMEX> . "
This is the auditor 's conclusion from the auditor - general after auditing the embezzlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Fenghua Garden</ENAMEX> properties by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Community Association</ENAMEX> , which says there is no law - abiding community association .
Therefore , be it embezzlement or robbery , there 's no surprise .
God ! It really makes you tremble with fear when such words are uttered by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">communist</ENAMEX> official specializing in auditing .
How are the fundamental purposes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chinese Communist Party</ENAMEX> implemented among officials , media , procuratorate , court and government in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xuzhou</ENAMEX> ?
No wonder the media are afraid of releasing the actual situation at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Fenghua Garden</ENAMEX> .
You , leaders of the legal and political communities educated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Party</ENAMEX> , do n't you feel the severity of the problem ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The community association</ENAMEX> is a grass - root organization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Party</ENAMEX> , which also hosts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Party Branch</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The community association</ENAMEX> does not obey the law , and even deliberately break the law , seizing and looting properties of residents and people and beating others in retaliation , coupled with the police 's involvement in beating others .
These have deeply hurt people 's hearts and will lead to a loss of support of people over time .
This is a major issue crucial to the life and death of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Party</ENAMEX> and the nation , which no <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">communists</ENAMEX> or righteous <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> should turn a blind eye to .
Specifically , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">communists</ENAMEX> and righteous and integral people at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Fenghua Garden</ENAMEX> should no longer keep silent .
We appeal to Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xu Ming</ENAMEX> to address issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Fenghua Garden</ENAMEX> , as well as the issue that " there is no law - abiding community association in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xuzhou</ENAMEX> " promptly .
If it drags on again without solution , we should appeal to Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Yuanchao</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Provincial Committee</ENAMEX> , up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Central Committee</ENAMEX> , with liabilities of leaders at various levels investigated .
Everyone is called upon for uniform action .
A communist , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 6 , 2007</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Peirong</ENAMEX> received " death " threat for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">as long as a week</ENAMEX> .
Director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Owner Committee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Peirong</ENAMEX> , insisted on reporting and revealing publicly the illegal behaviors such as embezzlement and appropriation of public properties of the owners .
The action of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Peirong</ENAMEX> has stood in the way of some people to become rich and smashed the millionaire dream of some people in their attempt to embezzle and appropriate public properties , and so they hate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Peirong</ENAMEX> to the guts .
Recently , wife of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Guanghua</ENAMEX> , Deputy - Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Community Party Branch</ENAMEX> , has written more than once on the community notice board such things as " <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Peirong</ENAMEX> is on a no - return road , " issuing open " death " threat to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Peirong</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Peirong</ENAMEX> has reported to the police many times since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 4</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Guanghua 's</ENAMEX> wife exercised no restraint , and instead she wrote the " death " threat on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Peirong 's</ENAMEX> unit entrance on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">8th</ENAMEX> .
The fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Guanghua 's</ENAMEX> wife had the nerve to issue " death " threat to the reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Peirong</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> is associated with the public security 's failure to investigate the case that the reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Peirong</ENAMEX> was bashed up by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> family members of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu Yongxiu</ENAMEX> , Director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Fenghua Garden Community Association</ENAMEX> .
With the reporter 's rights not guaranteed , law - breakers , criminals and the corrupt have no fear and retaliate upon the reporter .
The evil force is rampant at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fenghua Garden</ENAMEX> community , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xuzhou</ENAMEX> .
With stolen authorities , they have embezzled and appropriated public properties of the owners by hook or crook and sought a protection layer through bribery .
They beat up the reporter and issued " death " threat .
This is not only an open provocation to the reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Peirong</ENAMEX> , but also an open provocation to owners at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Fenghua Garden</ENAMEX> , as well as an open provocation to the social legal system , which serious deteriorate the social atmosphere .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 8 , 2007 .</ENAMEX>
Corruption is astounding in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xuzhou</ENAMEX> , with the corrupt committing all kinds of crimes blatantly .
The struggle against corruption makes little progress as it takes both blood and tears .
