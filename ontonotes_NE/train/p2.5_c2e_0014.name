These days , overseas study has become popular .
To friends and relatives , it 's a proud thing to be mentioned .
Children of the rich and government officials , who does n't want to enhance their status through overseas study ?
Let alone that getting oneself a western diploma will make getting a good job easier in the future .
Even old dad and mom making a parade of it everywhere would look exceedingly good !
However , those in middle class families or even laid - off workers see those children of the wealthy and powerful go overseas , come back cloaked in glory and all have a good future -LRB- they do n't know that family wealth and good backgrounds of those are the only real guarantees -RRB- .
How wonderful !
Thereupon , they pinch and scrape to send their child overseas ,
It seems that once they are sent overseas , nothing but a wonderful future and unlimited glory will return .
Nowadays , it is more often the case that those who do n't pass the university entrance exam and are wasting their days at home without doing anything are sent overseas .
With a bit of " toughening up " , everything will be okay .
Wrong !
With a huge chunk of cash spent , the frightening thing is that the payoff falls far short of expectations .
Even more frightening is that it holds the child back .
I 've been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> for several years !
What I have experienced myself or , even more , what I have seen are the countless who have given up their studies year by year , those with wrecked health everywhere , those who sold their souls and even those who lost their lives .
Overseas study is a splendid term , but in return it demands youth , effort and staunch perseverance , as well as sufficient rationality .
Life is never a bed of roses in any location , even more in a foreign land where there is a language barrier , different customs and no family or friends .
