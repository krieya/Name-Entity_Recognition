Markets usually get noticed because they soar or plunge .
Gold , which has n't risen or fallen significantly in quite some time , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> achieved what may be a new level of impassiveness : The most actively traded futures contracts closed unchanged despite nervous fluctuations in both the dollar and the stock market .
The settlement prices of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April</ENAMEX> gold contracts were even with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> 's final prices .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1989</ENAMEX> contract , which has the greatest trading volume , ended at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">371.20</ENAMEX> an ounce .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">The other months</ENAMEX> posted advances of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 cents to 20 cents</ENAMEX> an ounce .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> analyst , Bernard Savaiko of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , the stock market 's ability on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> to rally from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Friday 's</ENAMEX> decline -- which seemed to indicate that the economy was n't going to fall either -- took the starch out of precious metals prices , and out of gold 's , in particular .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , gold traded within a narrow range .
Gold tried to rally on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> but ran into the same situation that has subdued gold prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a year</ENAMEX> : selling by gold producers , who want to fix the highest possible price for their gold .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> delivery gold is trading in a range of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 365 to $ 375</ENAMEX> -LCB- an ounce -RCB- and is having difficulty breaking out above that , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savaiko</ENAMEX> said .
`` Producers at the moment regard that area a good one in which to sell gold . ''
Also , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savaiko</ENAMEX> noted , stock market investors seeking greater safety are veering toward buying bonds rather than precious metals because `` we are tending more toward a disinflationary economy that does n't make gold and precious metals attractive . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Nichols</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">APMS Canada</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> precious metals advisers , said there is little to motivate gold traders to buy the metal .
`` Investors in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> are comfortable with the actions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the -LCB- Federal Reserve -RCB-</ENAMEX> in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system , which helped the stock market rebound on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
There is n't any rush on the part of investors in the West to buy gold , he said .
`` They still bear the memory of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1987</ENAMEX> , when they bought gold after the stock market crashed and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nichols</ENAMEX> said .
`` It 's an experience they do n't want to repeat . ''
At the moment gold traders are n't concerned about inflation , he said , and as for the dollar , `` gold 's association with the currency has been diminishing recently so drops in the currency are n't having much impact on gold . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinsa Mehta</ENAMEX> , chief bullion trader for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chase Manhattan Bank</ENAMEX> , said : `` There is little incentive on the part of traders to sell gold because the stock market may go lower and gold may retain some of its ` flight to safety ' quality .
There is little incentive to buy gold because if the stock market goes higher , it may be just a false alarm .
This is keeping the gold traders handcuffed . ''
The most remarkable feature about <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's action was that the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $ 370</ENAMEX> an ounce was regarded as attractive enough by gold producers around the world to aggressively sell gold , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX> said .
`` I do n't know what it means over the long run , but for the short term , it appears that gold producers are grateful for the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10</ENAMEX> or so that gold has risen over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past week</ENAMEX> or so , '' he said .
Previously , he noted , gold producers tended to back off from a rising gold market , letting prices rise as much as possible before selling .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX> observed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> merchandise trade deficit , which rose sharply in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's report , has been having less and less impact on the gold market .
`` The dollar has n't reacted much to it , so gold has n't either , '' he said .
In other commodity markets <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> :
ENERGY :
Crude oil prices rose slightly in lackluster activity as traders in the pits tried to assess action in the stock market .
Since stock market indexes plummeted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Friday</ENAMEX> , participants in all markets have been wary .
When traders become confident that the stock market has stabilized , oil prices are expected to rise as supply and demand fundamentals once again become the major consideration .
Crude oil for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> delivery edged up by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">16 cents</ENAMEX> a barrel to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">20.75</ENAMEX> a barrel .
Heating oil prices also rose .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> gasoline slipped slightly .
SUGAR :
Futures prices rose on a report that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> may seek to postpone some sugar shipments .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March</ENAMEX> contract advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.14 cent</ENAMEX> a pound to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.11 cents</ENAMEX> .
According to an analyst , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> ca n't meet all its shipment commitments and has asked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> to accept a delay of shipments scheduled for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">later this year</ENAMEX> , into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early next year</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> is perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar , '' the analyst said .
It was the possibility of this demand that helped firm prices , the analyst said .
Another analyst noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> has been deferring shipments in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
`` To the professionals in the trade it did n't cause much surprise .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March</ENAMEX> futures contract traded <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as 14.24 cents</ENAMEX> , but could n't sustain the advance , '' he said .
LIVESTOCK AND MEATS :
The prices of cattle , hogs and pork belly futures contracts rebounded as livestock traders shook off fears that the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> stock market plunge would chill consumer spending , which in turn would hurt retail sales of beef and pork .
The prices of most livestock futures contracts had dropped sharply <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
Cattle futures prices were also supported <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> by signs that supermarket chains are making plans to increase their promotions concerning beef .
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS :
The prices of most soybean and soybean - meal futures contracts rose amid rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> is interested in buying from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South America</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 250,000 metric tons</ENAMEX> of soybeans and <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as many as 400,000 metric tons</ENAMEX> of soybean meal .
Traders are especially sensitive to reports of possible <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> soybean sales because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> exports are lagging .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 1</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 13 million fewer bushels</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> soybeans have been sold overseas than for the same period <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
Corn futures prices rose slightly while wheat prices settled mixed .
