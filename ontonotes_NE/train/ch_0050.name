Good
the- there 's something else I was in the middle
and I meant to do it weeks a-
I 'm sending a big information and letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Perez</ENAMEX> yeah because I heard him say on the on the radio weeks ago yeah that I mea-
I do n't know if I should really say this
you know it 's really nothing
but
oh well were being
no no
Well maybe it 's politics
maybe we should n't talk politics
It 's it 's not it 's not pol- it 's %uh it 's %uh it 's environmental politics
it 's not %uh politics though
%um he said that Is- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> is such a highly I knew that I do n't know I technical %uh advanced technical country that if there 's something good they 're going to use it
and he mentioned the the hormones for the milk yeah oh yeah that was a big thing he- no there was a big thing here about the milk that they put silicon in the milk here or something there was a big thing that makes the cows where they were
it 's %uh yeah we- it 's it 's hormones to make the cows give more
oh oh oh no
that 's something different
yes
and it 's terrible
it 's a terrible horrible thing
yeah
yeah
So I when I heard he said he 's going to us- he says we 'll use it you know I I my heart went down to the floor because we 're fighting here oh I did n't hear that very much against it because it 's such a bad thing
against
yeah
yeah
I did n't hear that
It makes the cows sick
you get you get all the bacteria
you get the sickness
and
oh jeez I did n't know
I did n't even know that here
and now I 'm not going to drink the milk over here
No no no
I do n't know if they 're using it yet
I do n't know if they are
but it would n't be bad tha-
they 're called growth hormone
yeah
yeah
I know
I 've heard
I think they do that to the chickens
I hear they do the chickens
they want the
yeah
oh they do it here you know
it 's it 's ap-
I 'm getting into a subject which I really did n't intend
but but in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> they wo n't do it
no no
Well a lot of people do n't eat meat anymore because of you know all these objections and all
they 've stopped %uh
it 's true
it 's true
it
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> in general do- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> do n't eat that much meat anyway
it 's more we eat fruit vegetables an- yeah yeah stuff
nobody really eats steaks anymore
like I I grew up on steaks all the time from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sam 's Supermarket</ENAMEX> every you know all the
yeah
from Sam 's Supermark-
uh-huh
yeah
I jeez %uh the last time he had a steak was I do n't know months ago
we do n't even eat steaks anymore
but duh %eh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> too they do n't eat as much do they
%uh no
because for heart the fat is supposed by very bad
yes
Hello
oh yeah
yeah
you said people are not
no
the red meat is suffering I guess
I noticed that last time I was home
but y- but I do n't eat any either
so
yeah
I know it 's not a good idea
I I 'm I
but Canada does n't use that junk
I mean and they tell us I think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Europe</ENAMEX> does n't us- wo n't buy from us because they do n't want that the hormones with s- stuff in it
yeah
yeah
I know
I know
it 's %uh
and but we 're using it naturally
Well
so everything you kn-
it makes I tell you it breaks my heart when I see them following that
they think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> is so everything is so wonderful
if there 's some
yeah
yeah
I know
they take they take the good and the bad all the
and that 's t-
yeah
oh it 's pitiful
that makes me very very sad
you know oh it 's %eh
very sad
an- and even the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> the- they come over
and I know I can see the attitude %ah well that of course they know for ins-
Ira is now %um like a adv- he 's working in a local in a neighborhood association like on on f- on on funds
yeah
yeah
on grants
he does a wonderful job
and they help him
oh I think I think he was n't working when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holly</ENAMEX> was here
I think he was n't working
he 's was n't working <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over three</ENAMEX> yeah oh that 's good that he <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three and half years</ENAMEX>
but this is parttime
but it 's very involving
it 's very exciting
oh that 's nice
and I thought that the people line up to see him
and it 's about food s- getting help with housing and food stamps and everything
yeah
and a lady said you know my husband died and old l- and old lady
I said oh I 'm sorry
she says I s- really thought <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> that you do n't die she sa- you know
but and I knew that underlying it they really believe that because if it 's so wonderful
yeah
they know every- they know everyone dies
but underneath they feel maybe maybe you do n't die until you 're very very old
but they do n't believe that so many people die in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> because it 's so wonderful
oh wow I do n't know where they got that idea from
yeah
but you see how it is
jeez
so everybody has these wrong conceptions
I know
I know %eh
%eh it 's %uh it 's %uh pitiful
but
oh well
yeah
I 'm su-
Holly is %uh busy with all her No that 's good now that 's nice cook things
and she 's goi- she 's going to teach
