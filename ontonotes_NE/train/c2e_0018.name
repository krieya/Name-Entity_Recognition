Does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Weiying 's</ENAMEX> misinterpretation of revolution harbor malicious intent ?

-LSB- ＊Lingtai Shanyin＊ -RSB- .
In an interview with Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Weiying</ENAMEX> that I read recently , when I read Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> 's understanding of revolution , I felt deeply worried - deeply worried for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Beijing University</ENAMEX> , deeply worried for some outstanding contemporary youth , and deeply worried for the future of the country .
Some people oppose the whole class struggle thing , some people deny <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX> Thought , but <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , with democracy making progress , some people have the nerve to talk about revolution !!!
So as not to take his words out of context , I will insofar as possible cite Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> 's explanation of revolution :
" In reality , ' the way ' - or we can call it ' reason ' - has quite a complex relationship with the law .
What we call ' reason ' involves looking at what you do to see whether it creates value for society .
' Reason ' is above ' law ' : reasonable things have a natural validity ; lawmaking should be carried out according to the demands of reason ; unreasonable laws are not correct .
But in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , both in the past and now , there are many reversals of the natural order between law and reason ; thus making it hard to judge if a so - called " illegal " thing is also unreasonable .
For example , when there was a revolution in the past , it was precisely the most idealistic people who were willing to sacrifice their lives .
Why sacrifice their lives ?
Because it was illegal .
Or take bribery for example .
When someone is being blackmailed , he hands over the money , and that is a form of bribery .
But you ca n't say that his doing that is wrong : at least he deserves our empathy . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.</ENAMEX> In human history , there is a clear standard for good and evil , righteousness and iniquity , advances and reversals , glory and shame , progress and reaction , etc .
This standard is :
Things that are for the majority , for the masses of people , for altruism are good , righteous , progressive , glorious , advanced .
Things that are for the minority , against the people and self - serving are bad , unrighteous , shameful , reactionary .
Revolution is clearly a thing for the majority , for the masses of people , and altruistic ; therefore revolution is good , righteous , progressive , glorious and advanced !
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.</ENAMEX> Law has a clear class character ; bourgeois reason makes no sense for proletarian law .
And proletarian reason makes no sense for bourgeois law !
On major issues of principle , lawmaking starts with the protection of the interests of a particular class ; it is not that ' reason ' tops ' law ' : rational things have a natural validity ; so the making of laws should be carried out according to the requirements of reason , and irrational laws are wrong . "
This kind of so - called " reason " ignores the class nature of law , and in terms of the great theoretician <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Professor Zhang 's</ENAMEX> , this is a classic example of malicious intent .
What is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Professor Zhang 's</ENAMEX> purpose in his misinterpretation of revolution and his ignoring the class nature of law ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.</ENAMEX> He misinterprets revolution in order to confuse good and evil , righteousness and iniquity , advances and reversals , glory and shame , progress and reaction , and to advance some unnamable theories .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.</ENAMEX> He ignores the class nature of law in order to enact laws that harm the interests of the masses of workers and peasants .
Unfortunately , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Professor Zhang</ENAMEX> may have greatly miscalculated .
