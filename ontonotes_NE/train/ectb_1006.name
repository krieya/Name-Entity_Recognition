<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> TV Gets Taiwanized !
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Lin</ENAMEX> / tr. by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Newell</ENAMEX>
Recently the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00 p.m.</ENAMEX> serials being shown on television in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> have shown a trend toward " Taiwanization . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> main broadcast stations are showing prime - time <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama , and these are pulling in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly three - quarters</ENAMEX> of the viewing audience .
Of these programs , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fortune is in Heaven 's Hands</ENAMEX> , broadcast by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Formosa Television</ENAMEX> , stands at the top of the heap .
It is said that , along with pop music , prime - time TV serials are one of the most important elements of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> popular culture , and that they reflect social trends .
What then is the relationship between the rise of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama -LRB- that is , mainly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> dialect and focused on the lives of distinctly <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> - as opposed to " mainlander " - characters -RRB- and contemporary society and culture in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> ?
Do these shows reflect the real lives and aspirations of the audience ?
And what kinds of limitations exist ?
" Mama !
Do n't beat me any more !
Mama ! "
Little <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ho - ho</ENAMEX> , a student at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Yungho Wanghsi Primary School</ENAMEX> , is showing off to his aunt some <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> - language lines he learned from television .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ho - ho</ENAMEX> is a typical child of a northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> mainlander family -LRB- i.e. a family which came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> from mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> only after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">WWII</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Because he spoke only <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Mandarin Chinese</ENAMEX> at home and at school , he did n't really know any <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> until recently .
But in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of years</ENAMEX> his <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> has improved dramatically , thanks to the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00 p.m.</ENAMEX> serials .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ho - ho 's</ENAMEX> guardian , his aunt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsui Mei - lan</ENAMEX> , bemoans the fact that " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's prime - time shows are violent , and even the love stories have people constantly slapping each other and arguing violently , so they are really not suitable for small children . "
But when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ho - ho</ENAMEX> told her that he wanted to watch these programs every evening in order to learn <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsui</ENAMEX> , who all her life has experienced the problems of not being able to speak or understand <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> , found it hard to refuse .
The child 's rapid success at picking up <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> has amazed her .
The revival of reality
Little <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ho - ho</ENAMEX> 's line - " Do n't beat me any more ! " - reflects one of the more common themes of TV shows done in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> .
Beating of children , often by an evil stepmother , is not unusual .
This is not because <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> are especially firm believers in corporal punishment .
Rather this kind of thing is a " trademark " that has become attached to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama over the course of its history .
As a result , even though " nativist drama " has escaped the stereotypical setting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> countryside of the past and increasingly focuses on contemporary urban life , such provocative scenes - playing to elemental emotions to pull on the heart - strings - are still common .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> serials depict the daily life of ordinary people the way they do because of their development process , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ko Yu - fen</ENAMEX> , an associate professor of mass communications at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shih Hsin University</ENAMEX> , who has done a study of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> TV drama .
" And now , because of the trend in society of reviving <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> as the mother tongue , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama has been able to leap into prime time to become the mainstream offering in the past few years . "
The <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00 p.m.</ENAMEX> time slot has long been the flagship and leading money maker for television stations .
For a program to get into this slot , besides being commercially viable , in the past it also had to be politically correct .
This used to mean : " No use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> language . "
Because the government wanted to promote <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Mandarin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> was officially seen as a rustic dialect , and was never eligible for prime time .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> government - run television stations of that era - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">China Television</ENAMEX> -LRB- CTV -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chinese Television Service</ENAMEX> -LRB- CTS -RRB- , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taiwan Television</ENAMEX> -LRB- TTV -RRB- - had a tacit agreement that they would only show <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> programs at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</ENAMEX> or in the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">6:30 p.m.</ENAMEX> time slot , when most viewers would be housewives and elderly people .
The programming for these time slots was low - budget , and the subject matter limited to ordinary life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's unsophisticated rural past , mostly tragic tales of mistreated daughters - in - law and the like , or family comedies .
Thus , for a long time , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama gave people the impression of being lowbrow .
It was not until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> , with the broadcasting of the series <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Love</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CTS</ENAMEX> , that the prime - time language taboo was even partly challenged .
This series also raised the quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama , and planted the seeds for future efforts .
The show was set against the background of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the August 7th Flood of 1959</ENAMEX> .
The story portrayed how some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> and mainlanders went from mutual misunderstanding to mutual forgiveness .
The performers spoke in both <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Mandarin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> .
Because the language taboo has long carried heavy political undertones - the opposition has always preferred the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> , the ruling party has , until recently , almost exclusively favored <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Mandarin</ENAMEX> - the producers invited many people from the arts community to confirm that <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> was essential for the program , so as to dispel the suspicions of those who would see political motives behind language choice .
Unfortunately , the effort was less than a complete success .
For one thing , stereotypes remained strong , and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Love</ENAMEX> still retained many of the old traditions , being a tragic small family drama focusing on a young bride facing hard times after moving into the husband 's home .
Moreover , because of opposition from high officials at the television network , after several episodes , the performers who had previously spoken in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> had their dialogue changed to " <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Mandarin</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> accent . "
However , because the plot was realistic , ratings were unprecedented , and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Love</ENAMEX> even defeated <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Widow 's Watch</ENAMEX> , based on a novel by , and also produced by , the vastly popular romance writer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiung Yao</ENAMEX> , and broadcast on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CTV</ENAMEX> .
At that time , many commentators suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Love</ENAMEX> was successful largely because of the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin Ling - ling</ENAMEX> , a script writer for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Widow 's Watch</ENAMEX> , says that the real reason <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Love</ENAMEX> succeeded was because of its realistic depiction of the lives of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> .
Her opinion is that " love stories involving constant hitting and screaming and dramatic twists and turns are not the stuff of real life , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiung Yao 's</ENAMEX> series departed too far from reality .
This in fact has been a chronic problem of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's dramatic serials . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Love</ENAMEX> succeeded largely because it wedded realism to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> subject matter .
Politics in command ?
However , though the series was popular , it did not immediately spark a wave of enthusiasm for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> subject matter .
The government around that time adopted a policy of allowing producers to go to mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> to film , and there was a sudden craze for martial arts series and love stories framed against a mainland backdrop .
Still , television stations and producers had awakened to the existence of an audience for " <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">nativist</ENAMEX> " <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Qingdao Lake incident</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</ENAMEX> , " mainland fever " plummeted , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">nativist</ENAMEX> stories using the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">once</ENAMEX> again saw their star rising .
This time they went right at major political taboos like <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the February 28 Incident of 1947</ENAMEX> .
Writer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin Ling - ling</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the White Terror</ENAMEX> as subject matter to write the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">nativist</ENAMEX> prime - time drama in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> television history - <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh</ENAMEX> .
It was so popular that its producer , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu Chin - liang</ENAMEX> , ended up making a trilogy around the same theme .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin</ENAMEX> explains : " I always want to write a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama against the backdrop of great events , and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the February 28 Incident</ENAMEX> was at that time just beginning to get intensive open discussion , so there was a lot of commercial viability as well . "
Owing to the series ' popularity , lead actor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lun Hsiao - hua</ENAMEX> has become a major television star , while female lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Mei - feng</ENAMEX> established her image as a traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> woman of gentility and virtue , and has since gotten numerous roles and television commercials .
However , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin</ENAMEX> with a laugh , things did n't go exactly as she expected .
" Because the writer , director , and actors all had different political orientations , after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> several episodes which laid out the background of the era were produced , the plot shifted toward traditional family relations and romance , along the lines of the typical prime - time serial . "
The series was nonetheless a watershed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> was no longer taboo , and indeed identification with " Taiwanese-ness " came to be highly admired .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ko Yu - fen</ENAMEX> states that it is not difficult to understand these trends against the backdrop of society at that time .
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh</ENAMEX> was broadcast just after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> direct popular elections for municipal mayors and provincial governor , when the " underground " call - in television programs were at their peak of popularity , and when discussion of " <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> identity " was at a fever pitch .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu Hsiao - tsu</ENAMEX> , a former aide to the legislative caucus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Democratic Progressive Party</ENAMEX> , recalls that although <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh</ENAMEX> did not go very deeply into the historical facts and controversies of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the February 28 Incident</ENAMEX> , he and his friends , enthusiastic student activists in the opposition movement , felt that it was of great symbolic importance that prime - time television - which had always represented conservative values - was broadcasting a series on this subject using both <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Mandarin</ENAMEX> .
He laughs , " Even though I usually do n't have any interest in watching TV , at that time we tuned in at eight sharp every night , as a kind of moral support . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ko Yu - fen</ENAMEX> says , however , that times have changed .
Linguistic and historical conditions politicized <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama .
There had always been controversy over it .
But the political significance faded , and , with the daughter - in - law series beginning in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama became embroiled in a very different controversy - that it was oversimplified and stereotypical , and that the clock had been turned back to the early days of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> - language programming .
The daughter - in - law series was a collection of all - <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> - language stories broadcast by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CTS</ENAMEX> , describing the relationship between daughters - in - law and mothers - in - law in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's traditional rural society .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> of the series , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Astonishing Daughter - in - Law</ENAMEX> , got an enthusiastic audience response , and the show , which like all prime - time serials was broadcast nightly <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , lasted for nearly a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> .
The hard - pressed daughter in law
The story of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Astonishing Daughter - in - Law</ENAMEX> is quite simple .
The daughter - in - law , played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Yu - yen</ENAMEX> , is mistreated by her mother - in - law , and , with outsiders butting in and causing trouble , she gets abused from beginning to end .
Yet she maintains her traditional womanly virtues , never fights back , and in the end is rewarded with a happy ending .
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> does not speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> very well , her pitiable demeanor won a lot of sympathy from the audience .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Chin - jung</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Changhua County</ENAMEX> civil servant and longtime fan of TV serials , says critically , " It drove me nuts watching the daughter - in - law just sit there and take abuse from her mother - in - law day in and day out .
Also , the costumes and sets were so crude , there was no difference from a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">6:30</ENAMEX> show . "
Yet , she says , her grandmother was in tears every day , explaining that young women <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">today</ENAMEX> could never understand the suffering and indignities endured by daughters - in - law in the past .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ko Yu - fen</ENAMEX> ascribes the success of the daughter - in - law series to several factors :
" By playing on people 's heart strings , using <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> language , and being set against the background of that bitter era , the daughter - in - law series brought together all the traditional elements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama , but in addition added new structure and packaging , and integrated the spiciness and conflict typical of an <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00</ENAMEX> show .
No wonder it was so successful . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin Ling - ling</ENAMEX> says that criticism of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00</ENAMEX> serials for being melodramatic is certainly not without foundation , yet , however people may criticize , there are still viewers who ca n't get enough .
The audience is composed mainly of older folk and housewives .
In general , they do n't want to watch something they have to really think too much about .
The simpler the characters and the plot , and the more conflict there is , the better .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin</ENAMEX> adds that intellectuals criticize such shows but in fact do n't watch TV .
Television stations have always based their decisions on ratings , and it is virtually impossible to expect that they will change a proven formula .
" Rather than say that serials are a mirror of life , it would be better to say that people identify with the characters in these dramas even if their own lives are not as dramatic . "
These are the terms used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Yen</ENAMEX> , a professor in the department of broadcasting and television at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Chengchi University</ENAMEX> .
This is particularly the case for older people and housewives .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai</ENAMEX> , the formula for success revolves around romance or family relations .
For dramatic effect , there need to be elements of hatred or revenge , and usually one irredeemably evil character whose purpose is to create obstacles to the romantic or career success of the main character .
The focus is extremely narrow - personal achievement .
Social issues serve only as background or embellishment .
The daughter - in - law series precisely fits this structure .
Realistic fashion
After the daughter - in - law series , there was a uniformity in dramatic serials all following the trend .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama went into a steady decline .
However , just when things looked bleakest , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">nativist</ENAMEX> drama began to break out of its previous framework with the appearance of the " river of time " structure , characterized by a cross-generational story depicting long - term social evolution in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
This format incorporates the rural themes of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama , but the stories evolve with time , and also portray modern urban life .
Not only has this format given new life to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama , it has also pioneered an entirely new type of television drama - contemporary realism .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Formosa Television</ENAMEX> had enthusiastic audiences for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Springtime Stepmother 's Heart</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> .
The character of actress <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pai Ping - ping</ENAMEX> played against the stereotype of the abusive stepmother , instead being a woman who brings <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of her own children into a marriage into a wealthy family .
She has to deal on the one hand with the lack of understanding from her mother - in - law and on the other look after <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> children from different families as well as the husband 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> wife , who suffers from mental illness .
And after financial setbacks , she also has to support the whole family .
Because the series was so popular , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FTV</ENAMEX> seized the opportunity and presented a sequel based on the loves and hates of the third generation , which , as expected , also was very well received .
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Springtime Stepmother 's Heart</ENAMEX> pulled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FTV</ENAMEX> financially out of the red and into the black , and is considered an extremely remarkable event in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> television history .
Executive chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Kang - hsin</ENAMEX> proudly calls the new format developed by FTV " contemporary drama . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien Chang - yu</ENAMEX> , a senior reporter covering film and TV for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Daily News</ENAMEX> , explains that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FTV</ENAMEX> has been successful in the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00</ENAMEX> time slot not only because " the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> language fits right in with the trends of the times , " but also because " the inclusion of little conversations and incidents that occur in everyday life makes these series accessible and familiar to the viewers . "
That TV stations agree can be seen from the most recent offering from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FTV</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fortune is in Heaven 's Hands</ENAMEX> , which offers a realistic depiction of urban life .
Fortune is also cross-generational .
The story begins with the death of the husband of the main female character .
She struggles to raise her infant son , and is a frequent target of criticism from her mother - in - law .
The son then grows into adulthood , and all the feelings - gratitude , revenge , love , hate - of the older generation carry on into the younger .
In the city the children help each other and compete against each other as the story grows increasingly explosive .
The combination of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> and contemporary factors has made the show a hit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien Chang - yu</ENAMEX> says that recently <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> broadcast stations have been showing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FTV</ENAMEX> 's ratings stand alone , far ahead of all the others .
A show can not be popular simply by using <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> language , she says - the audience must be able to identify with it .
This is how the series <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Real Love</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hong Kong cable TV</ENAMEX> has stayed so popular that it has run uninterrupted for several years .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ON programming</ENAMEX>
The success of serials means that TV stations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> just keep on cranking them out , broadcasting episodes as quickly as they are shot .
This special feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00</ENAMEX> time slot means that one can naturally not be too picky about quality .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu Hsiao - fen</ENAMEX> , a film star who has won numerous awards at the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Golden Horse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Asia - Pacific film festivals</ENAMEX> and who has recently jumped into prime time as the female lead in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fortune</ENAMEX> , explains : " They have a special name for shows that are being broadcast episode by episode as each one is shot : ' ON programming . '
It is common for an episode finished <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">today</ENAMEX> to be shown <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</ENAMEX> later . "
She finds this situation less than ideal .
She says that in order to keep up with the audience 's ever - changing tastes , scripts are being rewritten right up to the last minute .
Naturally television actors do not have the luxury that movie actors enjoy of allowing themselves time to slowly get in the right frame of mind for a role or scene , but even so , given the fact that TV actors must rely almost exclusively on dialogue and body language to keep the audience 's attention , the fact that shooting is so hurried not only waters down the quality of the performance , there is little time even to get the lines right .
Such conditions , she feels , make for productions that are really too rough around the edges .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chou You</ENAMEX> , who has produced more than <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">4,000 hours</ENAMEX> of dramatic series for television , says that prime time is like a battlefield for television stations .
Sometimes the producer ca n't call the shots .
Personally , she has always preferred to begin broadcasting only after the entire series has been completed , to ensure quality control .
But if a series is doing well , the station will want to extend it , and if ratings are less than ideal , the series must be prepared to wrap up at any moment .
The series on which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chou</ENAMEX> has recently been working had the final rushes confiscated by the network so that it can decide how to edit them , in order to determine how long the series will actually run .
" Even I do n't know when it will come to an end , " she says with exasperation .
Pop merchandise
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">April Chu</ENAMEX> , the producer of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fortune is in Heaven 's Hands</ENAMEX> , admits that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ON programming</ENAMEX> is a real bottleneck for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama .
But there is no quick - fix .
With the practical environment being what it is , people will simply have to think their way out of its limitations .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ON programming</ENAMEX> is simply the way Taiwan television works .
If the station strategy is set up that way , it 's unlikely they will change .
The only solution is through restructuring of the content , strengthening the rhythms , reducing the use of pointless patter to draw out the series , improving the dramatic structure , and adding new vitality to the roles . "
But how ?
She takes for example feminist issues , about which she is particularly concerned .
<ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">Twenty years ago</ENAMEX> , she wrote a TV serial that overturned the tradition that the female lead had to be chaste , unmarried , and dependent on men ; instead her female lead was a middle - aged divorcee with children and a relationship with a younger man .
Society was shocked from top to bottom .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Today</ENAMEX> , as she produces <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fortune</ENAMEX> , she still devotes special attention to the molding of the women 's roles .
From the character of the grandmother to that of the daughter , she insists that the script give them independent and strong - willed vitality .
She says , " Although you can say that prime time serials are merchandise and not art , you have to present up - to - date positive values .
You have to be responsible to the audience , and that 's also the key to continual innovation . "
Developing overseas markets
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> television serials have always sold well abroad .
But some people are concerned that an overemphasis on <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> themes and language will stifle the development of overseas sales .
" By nature , television drama is very localized .
Because of cultural differences , overseas audiences will not necessarily like the same things <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> audiences do , " says reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien Chang - yu</ENAMEX> .
That is why many " blue - chip " producers who control overseas copyrights are unwilling to touch <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">nativist</ENAMEX> serials .
They prefer to do martial arts or love stories that focus on no particular era or social backdrop .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin Ling - ling</ENAMEX> , on the other hand , believes that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> drama should have no problems holding its own against competition from other areas .
She says that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> drama generally maintains good pacing , but the way they handle dialogue , content , and emotion is not very convincing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PRC TV</ENAMEX> provides dramas which interpret actual historical events -LRB- as opposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's " historical " dramas which are mainly just made - up stories in period costume -RRB- , but they are too slow - moving .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> TV relies mostly on packaging of well - known " idols , " with most of the effort going into the aesthetics of presentation , and little emphasis on storyline .
Taiwan television drama , on the other hand , has conflict and intensity , and if it is well packaged , it should do well in the overseas market .
" You ca n't say that there 's no overseas market for drama just because it is <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">nativist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> .
After all , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> drama series have dominated the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> market for years , yet they also use a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> dialect - <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Cantonese</ENAMEX> - and are also set against the backdrop of their own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> society .
However , due to the strength of their entertainment industry , they 've been able to penetrate everywhere , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Yen</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> can learn from this experience .
Talent flow
As interactions between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PRC</ENAMEX> have grown , over the past few years there have been many cases of cooperative filming involving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , or of the hiring of technicians or performers from one area to work in another .
For example , for the martial arts dramas of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Pei - pei</ENAMEX> , the scripts and actors come from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , the director and the costume designer are from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , and the series are filmed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PRC</ENAMEX> using mainland technicians .
Technically speaking , they are extremely well done .
The same goes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiung Yao 's</ENAMEX> romantic dramas .
However , given the different cultural backgrounds of these people , there are limits to cooperation , and if you factor in political considerations , that makes the situation even more complex .
" Cross-national cooperation is the fastest way to get an infusion of fresh blood , but it is not a long - term solution , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien Chang - yu</ENAMEX> .
Recently the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PRC</ENAMEX> has begun to limit the number of people who can work in cooperative projects in order to protect its own TV industry , and sudden changes such as this will inevitably have an impact .
Prime time programming has long been a weaver of dreams for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> audiences .
But there is a huge difference between today 's society and that of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years ago</ENAMEX> .
If the dreams woven by the serials stay the same , or are even inferior , inevitably the audience will decline .
Given the ever growing pluralization of society in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , these shows must find new talent , overcome formulaic stories , and halt the decline in audience share .
Those in the industry must figure out how to draw people back .

So - called " ON programming " - meaning that series episodes are shot right before the time of broadcast - is a special feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's prime - time televised serials .
The advantage is that the story can be changed or the series extended or shortened depending upon ratings .
The disadvantage is that quality may suffer .
