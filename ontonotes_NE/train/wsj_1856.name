Part of a Series -RCB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Lombardi</ENAMEX> is a mild - mannered homemaker and grandmother in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hunterdon County</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J</ENAMEX> .
But put her behind a shopping cart and she turns ruthless .
If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Colgate</ENAMEX> toothpaste offers a tempting money - saving coupon , she 'll cross <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Crest</ENAMEX> off her shopping list without a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> thought .
Never mind that her husband prefers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Crest</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Some weeks</ENAMEX> when her supermarket runs a double - coupon promotion , she boasts that she shaves $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">22</ENAMEX> off her bill .
Money is n't the only thing that makes her dump once favorite brands .
After she heard about the artery - clogging hazards of tropical oils in many cookies , she dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pepperidge Farm</ENAMEX> and started buying brands free of such oils .
`` I always thought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pepperidge Farm</ENAMEX> was tasty and high quality , '' Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lombardi</ENAMEX> says .
`` But I do n't want any of that oil for my grandkids . ''
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pepperidge Farm</ENAMEX> says it ca n't tell exactly how many customers it has lost , but it hopes to remove the objectionable tropical oil from all its products by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year end</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
Clearly , people like Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lombardi</ENAMEX> are giving marketers fits .
She represents a new breed of savvy consumer who puts bargain prices , nutritional and environmental concerns , and other priorities ahead of old - fashioned brand loyalty .
While brand loyalty is far from dead , marketing experts say it has eroded during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</ENAMEX> .
Marketers themselves are partly to blame : They 've increased spending for coupons and other short - term promotions at the expense of image - building advertising .
What 's more , a flood of new products has given consumers a dizzying choice of brands , many of which are virtually carbon copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> other .
`` Marketers have brought this on themselves with their heavy use '' of promotions , contends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Plummer</ENAMEX> , an executive vice president at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">D'Arcy Masius Benton -AMP- Bowles</ENAMEX> ad agency .
`` Without some real product improvements , it 's going to be difficult to win that loyalty back . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Wall Street Journal 's</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American Way of Buying</ENAMEX> '' survey <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> found that most consumers switch brands for many of the products they use .
For the survey , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Peter D. Hart Research Associates</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 2,000</ENAMEX> consumers , including Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lombardi</ENAMEX> , whether they usually buy <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> brand of a certain type of product or have no brand loyalty .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</ENAMEX> the users of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</ENAMEX> products included in the survey said they 're brand switchers .
Overall , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</ENAMEX> of consumers are n't brand loyal for any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</ENAMEX> product categories .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 47 %</ENAMEX> are loyal for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one to five</ENAMEX> of the products .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 2 %</ENAMEX> are brand loyal in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 to 20</ENAMEX> of the categories , and no one is loyal for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20</ENAMEX> types of products .
For such products as canned vegetables and athletic shoes , devotion to a single brand was quite low , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fewer than 30 %</ENAMEX> saying they usually buy the same brand .
Only for cigarettes , mayonnaise and toothpaste did more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> of users say they typically stick with the same brand .
People tend to be most loyal to brands that have distinctive flavors , such as cigarettes and ketchup .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathie Huff</ENAMEX> , a respondent in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> survey from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spokane</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wash.</ENAMEX> , says her husband is adamant about eating only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hunt</ENAMEX> 's ketchup .
He simply ca n't stomach the taste of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Heinz</ENAMEX> , she says .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">31 - year - old</ENAMEX> homemaker adds , `` The only other thing I 'm really loyal to is my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Virginia Slims</ENAMEX> cigarettes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pepsi</ENAMEX> are all the same to me , and I usually buy whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale . ''
Brand imagery plays a significant role in loyalty to such products as cigarettes , perfume and beer .
People often stay with a particular brand because they want to be associated with the image its advertising conveys , whether that 's macho <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Marlboro</ENAMEX> cigarettes or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cher</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uninhibited</ENAMEX> perfume .
Loyalty lags most for utilitarian products like trash bags and batteries .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 23 %</ENAMEX> of trash - bag users in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> survey usually buy the same brand , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 29 %</ENAMEX> of battery buyers stick to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> brand .
Underwear scored a middling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36 %</ENAMEX> in brand loyalty , but consumer researchers say that 's actually quite high for such a mundane product .
`` In the past , you just wore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fruit of the Loom</ENAMEX> and did n't care , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Kim</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> director of consumer behavior research for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">J. Walter Thompson</ENAMEX> ad agency .
`` The high score reflects the attempts to make underwear more of a fashion image business for both men and women . ''
He believes there 's opportunity for a smart gasoline marketer to create a strong brand image and more consumer loyalty .
What loyalty there is to gas brands , he believes , is a matter of stopping at the most conveniently located service stations .
Brand loyalty was stronger among older consumers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> survey .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly one - fourth</ENAMEX> of participants <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">age 60</ENAMEX> and older claim brand loyalty for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</ENAMEX> products in the survey ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 9 %</ENAMEX> of those <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">age 18 to 29</ENAMEX> have such strong allegiance .
Higher - income people also tend to be more brand loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> survey and other research studies indicate .
Marketers speculate that more affluent people tend to lead more pressured lives and do n't have time to research the products they buy for the highest quality and most reasonable price .
An established brand name is insurance that at least the product will be of acceptable quality , if not always the best value for the money .
It 's sort of loyalty by default .
Meanwhile , `` the bottom end of the market is becoming less loyal , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurel Cutler</ENAMEX> , vice chairman of the ad agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FCB / Leber Katz Partners</ENAMEX> .
`` They 're buying whatever 's cheaper . ''
The biggest wild card in the brand loyalty game : How those hotly pursued but highly unpredictable baby boomers will behave as they move into middle age .
They grew up with more brand choices than any generation and have shown less allegiance so far .
But now that they 're settling down and raising families , might they also show more stability in their brand choices ?
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">J. Walter Thompson</ENAMEX> does n't think so .
He believes baby boomers will continue to be selective in their brand loyalties .
`` Earlier generations were brand loyal across categories , '' he says , `` but boomers tend to be brand loyal in categories like running shoes and bottled water , but less so in others like toilet paper and appliances . ''
While not as brand loyal as in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</ENAMEX> , consumers today do n't buy products capriciously , either .
Rather , they tend to have a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</ENAMEX> favorites .
Sometimes , they 'll choose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ragu</ENAMEX> spaghetti sauce ; other times , it will be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prego</ENAMEX> .
Advertisers attribute this shared loyalty to the striking similarity among brands .
If a more absorbent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pampers</ENAMEX> hits the market , you can be sure a new and improved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Huggies</ENAMEX> wo n't be far behind .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBDO Worldwide</ENAMEX> ad agency studied `` brand parity '' and found that consumers believe all brands are about the same in a number of categories , particularly credit cards , paper towels , dry soups and snack chips .
`` When there 's a clutter of brands , consumers simplify the complexity by telling themselves , ` All brands are the same so what difference does it make which I buy , ' '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Olshan</ENAMEX> , a senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBDO</ENAMEX> .
`` Too often , advertising imagery has n't done a good job of forging a special emotional bond between a brand and the consumer . ''
But given such strong brand disloyalty , some marketers are putting renewed emphasis on image advertising .
A small but growing number of companies are also trying to instill more fervent brand loyalty through such personalized direct - marketing ploys as catalogs , magazines and membership clubs for brand users .
While discount promotions are essential for most brands , some companies concede they went overboard in shifting money from advertising to coupons , refunds and other sales incentives .
Some people argue that strong brands can afford to stop advertising for a time because of the residual impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions of dollars</ENAMEX> spent on advertising through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</ENAMEX> .
But most companies are too afraid to take that chance .
And perhaps with good reason .
Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clayt Wilhite</ENAMEX> , president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">D'Arcy Masius</ENAMEX> ad agency 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> division , `` Every time <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</ENAMEX> pass without any advertising reinforcement , brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly -- even for a powerful brand like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Budweiser</ENAMEX> . ''
Consider , for example , what happened to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maxwell House</ENAMEX> coffee .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kraft General Foods</ENAMEX> brand stopped advertising for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> and gave up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business .
But since returning to advertising , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maxwell House</ENAMEX> has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Folgers</ENAMEX> .
`` Now , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kraft General Foods '</ENAMEX> parent company -RCB- is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maxwell House</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Mayer</ENAMEX> , president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Foods USA</ENAMEX> division .
`` Even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee , we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campbell Soup Co.</ENAMEX> , for one , has concluded that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who buy competitive brands .
`` The probability of converting a non-user to your brand is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Adams</ENAMEX> , the company 's vice president for marketing research .
`` The best odds are with your core franchise .
Our heavy users consume <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> cans of soup a week , and we 'd like to increase that . ''
So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campbell</ENAMEX> is talking to its `` brand enthusiasts , '' probing their psychological attachment to its soup .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> consumer focus group , a fan declared that , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campbell</ENAMEX> 's soup is like getting a hug from a friend . ''
That helped persuade the company to introduce a new advertising slogan : `` A warm hug from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campbell</ENAMEX> 's . ''
