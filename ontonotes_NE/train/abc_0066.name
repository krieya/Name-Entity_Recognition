In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Galapagos Islands</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ecuador</ENAMEX> , the oil spill that threatens so many species of rare birds and animals is now the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
Cleanup teams are desperately trying to save the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of endangered species .
A tanker ran aground <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">San Cristobal Island</ENAMEX> , and our <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ned Potter</ENAMEX> is there <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">This morning</ENAMEX> , the tanker was practically on its side , the waves breaking it off <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just 500 yards</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">San Cristobal Island</ENAMEX> , and despite their best efforts , officials said <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200,000 gallons</ENAMEX> of engine fuel had already leaked from the hull , endangering sea lions , pelicans , crabs and other species .
The best thing that you can do is take care of the oil here at the source of pollution , where it 's concentrated .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Stanton</ENAMEX> heads a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Coast Guard</ENAMEX> team , sent here at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ecuador</ENAMEX> 's request .
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mobile</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> , they 're trying , against the odds , to pump any remaining fuel from the ship so that it wo n't spill into the ocean , too .
You become sympathetic and empathetic with the people that are here .
They 've never experienced anything like this , and for them , it 's an emotional turmoil .
Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of people from around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Galapagos</ENAMEX> gathered in the harbor here to help in any way they could .
Fishermen in their boats , trying to clean up the waters .
Others trying to clean up shorelines , saving birds , all by hand .
How many animals have you cleaned off ?
This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> one .
The `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jessica</ENAMEX> '' was here to deliver fuel for tour boats , which bring many of the island 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45,000</ENAMEX> visitors .
In other words , the environment here was damaged , in part , because so many people come to marvel at it .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Galapagos</ENAMEX> are hallowed ground to many scientists , for it was here that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Darwin</ENAMEX> derived his theory of natural selection .
Now many of the fish he saw are in danger because pollutants could sink and kill the algae on which underwater life depends , but <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">late today</ENAMEX> , the news was encouraging -- that wind and currents were carrying most of the spill away from land .
I have a mixture of anxiety about the situation , and also relief , though .
We 've been lucky .
Lucky , but only up to a point .
This place has suffered its worst crisis in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</ENAMEX> , and found it itself almost helpless to protect itself .
