Everyone knows <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> is poor .
Every year <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> assists with such a great amount of grain , crude oil , and so many light industrial products .
From this we can see the degree to which agriculture and basic industries in this country have been reduced .
But for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korean</ENAMEX> athletes , although every one of them looks very skinny , their energy is no less than that of our athletes , who are provided with three scientifically formulated meals a day .
A women 's soccer match is now being broadcasted live .
Looking at the speed and fight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korean</ENAMEX> girls , I basically already know the outcome of this match .
Of course the soccer ball is round , and anything is possible , but to be able to excel under such repression is almost an impossible mission .
I have been thinking about what makes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korean</ENAMEX> athletes so full of energy ,
Though each of them looks sallow , when in a real fight , let alone <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , they are even no less strong -LRB- physically -RRB- than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> teams .
It suddenly occurred to me that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> is rich in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korean</ENAMEX> ginseng .
There is n't enough rice , but they can mix it with ginseng for food .
Although your stomach may be not satisfied with it , the energy your body gets is surely not something three meals of braised pork in brown sauce can compare .
