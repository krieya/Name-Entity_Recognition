While welcoming <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas McInnes 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 18</ENAMEX> letter offering corrections to your `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">World - Wide Tax Revolution</ENAMEX> '' table -LRB- editorial page , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 29</ENAMEX> -RRB- , I am surprised that he neglected other errors that , for some of us , strike close to home .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">a Channel Islander</ENAMEX> , I was amazed to see my birthplace listed as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</ENAMEX> countries with an income tax . ''
Despite a history of heated local debate on the topic , my passport clearly reads `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> citizen . ''
Whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McInnes</ENAMEX> 's oversight is merely a sign of a mainlander 's benign neglect is a question my fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Channel Islanders</ENAMEX> -LRB- and friends on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Isle of Man</ENAMEX> -RRB- will continue to ponder .
