<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> Starts Puffing Itself up -LRB- reposted from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Moonlight blog</ENAMEX> -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dift Wu</ENAMEX>
I went to sina.com <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> and suddenly saw a " strange " article from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">China Business News</ENAMEX> : " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> to Become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> Mainland City with a GDP per Capita of over <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000 US Dollars</ENAMEX> " -LAB-http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2007-01-04/051211947888.shtml-RAB- .
It says that the mayor of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> has said that calculated by the number of people registered as residents , the GDP per capita of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> will exceed <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000 US dollars</ENAMEX> .
The reason I thought it was strange was because according to some data that I already knew about -LAB-http://www.williamlong.info/archives/459.html-RAB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> 's GDP per capita should only reach the target of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000 US dollars</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</ENAMEX> .
Even though the RMB has increased in value , it still could n't be this fast .
This figure must have something wrong with it .
And the reason for the problem was still the population figure .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shenzhen</ENAMEX> and other cities all calculate GDP per capita using the permanent resident population in the calculation .
For cities with such large migrant populations , a GDP per capita calculated using the number of registered residents will be very inaccurate .
If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> calculates the GDP per capita using the permanent resident population , it 's obviously puffing itself up .
People from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> are usually very low - key about wealth .
They 'd never compare these vanities with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> .
This way , they can pay a little less tax to the central authorities : keeping quiet to get rich .
In addition , everyone is very clear about the situations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shenzhen</ENAMEX> .
For many years <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> has been just a little behind <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shenzhen</ENAMEX> in its economic indices and all aspects .
Its GDP will soon be exceeded by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shenzhen</ENAMEX> 's , yet its population has always been higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shenzhen</ENAMEX> 's .
I remember I wrote an article " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Mystery of Shenzhen 's GDP per capita</ENAMEX> -LAB-http://www.williamlong.info/archives/459.html-RAB- . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shenzhen</ENAMEX> 's GDP per capita is calculated using the number of permanent residents , and it is predicted that it wo n't top <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000 US dollars</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about 2008</ENAMEX> .
How could <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> 's leaders make this kind of wild assertion ?
This kind of showing off has never been the style of people from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> .
Various signs show that the new team of leaders in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> may have been transferred from another region .
They tend to like boasting and like playing number games to seek rewards from the central authorities .
If this really is the case , then <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> 's prospects for economic development may be indeed not good .
Fewer empty words and more real action has always been the straightforward style of people from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> .
Only by keeping the wealth among the people can a nation be ultimately rich .
Making the majority of people rich is the most important .
I hope the new team of leaders in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> will carefully learn from the experiences and lessons of the last few administrations and not to rival with places like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> in exaggeration .
Otherwise <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> 's development will really be a cause for worry .
