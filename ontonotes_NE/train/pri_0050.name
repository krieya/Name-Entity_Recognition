This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">World</ENAMEX> I am <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Mullins</ENAMEX> .
Well we ca n't tell you who won <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> , but in a moment we will enter the musical question , who let the dogs out ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> up we have the answer to our geo quiz <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
We are looking for a region of central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> bordering <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Adriatic Sea</ENAMEX> .
The area is mostly mountainous and includes <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mt. Corno</ENAMEX> , the highest peak of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Apennines</ENAMEX> .
It also includes a lot of sheep , good clean - living , healthy sheep , and an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Italian</ENAMEX> entrepreneur has an idea about how to make a little money of them .
The answer is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Abruzzo</ENAMEX> .
Journalist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Depalazai</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlo</ENAMEX> how does this fellow plan to profit from the sheep of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Abruzzo</ENAMEX> ?
He is taking advantage of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> crazes that we are having in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> at the moment , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> is internet , the other <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> is the awareness on food .
So this guy came up with the idea of having people adopting sheep by an internet .
So you can have access through your computer on your desk .
Go to the web site of these guys and you can have look at the face of sheep which are available to be adopted .
So what does it mean to adopt a sheep , to show up on your back step or do you , somehow keep track of its progress on the farm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> ?
You are not actually adopting the sheep in the sense that you can have it with you .
It looks like distant adoption , where you do n't actually have the child in your home .
You are just contributing with a certain amount of money and you are monitoring the growing up .
It works in the same way , so you have access on the web site of this little farm , in a little village of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Abrutzi</ENAMEX> and you can choose among many , many sheeps and after contributing with a certain amount of money the sheep is actually yours .
All right , so the amount of money you have mentioned to us is <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 160 US dollars</ENAMEX> and for that you get more than just a warm and fuzzy feeling .
You can also receive leggings that are made from wool of the sheep and even if you like some of the sheep dropping delivered to your door .
Yeah , I mean this is quite funny , but I think apart from all the details , which are sometimes even strange I think what is really important is that it is a sign of a new concern that is effecting <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Italian</ENAMEX> people .
I mean we are notoriously lover of good food .
We have a generous attitude towards food , and this is a new stuff .
The fact that you really care about a sheep in the way she is fed , in the way she is nurtured , in the way people are looking after it , because it 's a way to ensure that you have something which is genuine on your table up the end .
Wait <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a minute</ENAMEX> , you said that on your table at the end .
Yeah , at the table if it becomes food for instance , which is an option .
You are adopting the sheep and whatever happens at the end it 's your choice and among the option is you know food for your meal .
That kind of puts a whole new tone to this thing .
I mean usually when you think of this kind of adoption that means saving an animal not eventually eating it .
I mean this is an option which is available and I think it is a sort of provocation .
You know <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Italians</ENAMEX> now mainly live in metropolitan areas in big cities like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX> .
In the past , we were a population of shepherds or farmers .
We had completely different attitude towards nature .
It seems that we are losing something , and we need to reestablish a better relationship with nature and the simple fact that the Environment Minister in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> supported the initiative and he himself adopted a sheep is significant .
He took advantage immediately of these ideas to build up a new awareness and a new attitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Italians</ENAMEX> towards nature and farms .
