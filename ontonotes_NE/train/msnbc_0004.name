Both vehicles which are armored can house <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to twenty five</ENAMEX> marines /.
This time there were <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</ENAMEX> inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AAV</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</ENAMEX> died /.
and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> civilian translator was also killed /.
Now this occured in basically the same area where <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> marines were killed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> in an ambush launched by insurgents /.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> marines were snipers located on a roof looking for insurgents travelling down a smuggling route when they themselves were surrounded and killed by insurgent snipers /.
Now all of this violence has been located in an area known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Euphrates</ENAMEX> river valley /.
This is the main smuggling route for insurgents from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Syrian</ENAMEX> border into central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
There have been several marine operations in that area since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May</ENAMEX> to try to shut down those smuggling routes /.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's attacks show that the insurgents are still very resilient /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> /?
Thank you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX> /.
Now to politics /.
An <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> war vet who called President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> a chickenhawk and worse lost his bid to become a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> congressman from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</ENAMEX> /.
But it was close /.
and because it was in a heavily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOPed</ENAMEX> district it flashes a code red for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> correspondent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Shuster</ENAMEX> reports /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Tuesday night</ENAMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> district President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> carried by <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thirty points</ENAMEX> it was a victory for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Rebuplican</ENAMEX> anti-abortion advocate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Schmidt</ENAMEX> /.
Well ladies and gentlemen we passed the test /.
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> did not pass it by much /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> won by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only four percentage points</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Hackett</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hackett</ENAMEX> is a political newcomer and a veteran of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Iraq War</ENAMEX> /.
Knock off the crying /.
There 's nothing to cry about here /.
This was a success /.
This was the closest any <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> congressional candidate has come to beating a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> here in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than twenty years</ENAMEX> /.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Cincinnati Inquirer</ENAMEX> called the narrow margin quote nothing short of astounding /.
The central issue was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hackett</ENAMEX> a lawyer and a marine reservist who saw combat during a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven month</ENAMEX> tour bluntly bashed President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> calling him quote a chickenhawk and worse quote a son of a bitch /.
Who says bring it on is a cheerleader for the insurgents /.
That 's dangerous /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> a state lawmaker who believes schools should display the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</ENAMEX> commandments urged voters to punish <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hackett</ENAMEX> for his criticism of the president /.
And the national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> poured in <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">half a million dollars</ENAMEX> in anti-Hackett television ads /.
He supports raising social security taxes /.
The effort according to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> was to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> quote bury him /.
But it was an extremely shallow grave /.
And political analysts say the closer than expected outcome offers several lessons /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> of all voters now appear to be more receptive to criticism of the administration 's approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and skeptical of blanket support like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> 's /.
We know that we 're on the right track in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
and we need to stay the course /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> analyst says that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</ENAMEX> marines from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> killed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> had been ambushed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> the election results might have been reversed /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> 's close call may suggest that aligning with the administration on immigration and social security is precarious /.
And finally there is an advantage to campaigning as a political outsider /.
I 'm running because uh I actually want to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and fight for regular <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> /.
While campaigning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hackett</ENAMEX> repeatedly criticized the leadership of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republican party</ENAMEX> and argued that power brokers including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom DeLay</ENAMEX> must be replaced /.
When lawmakers come back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> though it is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> who will be joining them in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> who will be staying home /.
The question is was the anti-war sentiment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> congressional district a national bell weather signalling things to come /?
I 'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Shuster</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> /.
Joining me now is the winner of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> election <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> Congresswoman - elect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Schmidt</ENAMEX> /.
Congresswoman - elect thank you for coming on here on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> right away /.
Thank you so much /.
I 've been up <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">forty eight hours</ENAMEX> which proves that uh I still have the stamina of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty year old</ENAMEX> /.
Well you 'll love being in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House of Representatives</ENAMEX> /.
As we 've been talking I worked up there for a long time /.
It 's a wonderful place /.
It 's a very /-
I should say <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> with a lowercase d /.
it 's a very wonderful place to work /.
Let me ask you this /.
What did you make of your opponent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Hackett</ENAMEX> /?
W- Well /-
He was out there calling the president phrases /.
I 've never heard anybody call the President a son of a bitch /.
That 's quite a phrase /.
Uh he called him a chickenhawk /.
uh and he still got <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">forty eight percent</ENAMEX> /.
Well well he did that with the national media eh when he was trying to paint himself in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> based market /.
He was painting himself as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> /.
If you looked at his ad he aligned himself with the president because he caught on rather quick uh when he won the uh primary election and he had gone on a radio station and said uh that the worst threat to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> was not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama bin Laden</ENAMEX> but the President that uh people did n't like that /.
and so suddenly he decided to cloak himself as a supporter of the President in his tv ads /.
Let me ask you about the horror of the last couple of days in Iraq /.
A batallion based in Ohio the Buckeye State your state /-
Uh twenty people dead /.
Do you think this war is going to end up in a -- in a sense here at home much less popular say a year from now the way it 's going /?
Or where do you think it 's going in terms of public support /?
Well I think that the public /-
First off my my heartfelt condolences to the families that have been left behind /.
I I will continue to pray for them because I ca n't imagine what it 's like to wake up and realize that your loved one is never coming back /.
But uh I honor their sacrifice that these men and women have made because uh uh our freedom is not free /.
There is a cost to it /.
and uh we realized that when we woke up this morning /.
Having said that uh the people really want us to stay the course and finish the job /.
Uh we 've planted the seeds of democracy /.
and uh it would be irresponsible for us to leave now /.
The insurgents are trying to do this to whip the public sentiment into a frenzy uh to leave when it 's too soon so that they can once again take over uh that country /.
Uh we 're on the right track /.
We 're on the right course /.
I think that the finish line is is in sight /.
We just have to stay the course /.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> won your uh district your congressional district by a wide margin something like <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> /.
Could he do that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> /?
I think he still could /.
If you look at the way my opponent uh painted himself in this election with his literature and his tv and radio commercials he wrapped himself around the President /.
The public in this very short election cycle was rather confused as to who the real <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> was /.
And once the the mask was taken off uh and they realized that he was different uh then they uh were more solid in my camp /.
But uh with any short election and a very special election cycle I caution anybody to use this as a bell weather uh for uh where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republican party</ENAMEX> is going in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> because uh very unique elections make outcomes uh very very different /.
Let 's take a look at something you said here on this program <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> and see if you still think this way right now /.
They 're not solely focused on this war /.
Maybe the national media is /.
but the people right here in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> are talking about issues that affect them /.
They 're talking about having tax cuts that are permanent because they want to spend their own money they do n't want government to /.
Issues that affect them /.
Do you think that the loss uh of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty</ENAMEX> uh guys over there servicemen fighting for their country over in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> for their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> based unit is going to bring this war home to people /?
I do n't think it 's going to bring the h- -- the war home anymore differently than the button that I wear on my uh lapel /.
And that 's for Matt Moppin the only missing soldier in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
Uh the people in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> are very smart /.
They understand the sacrifices these men and women are making on our behalf /.
But they also want to talk about other issues issues like taxes and tax reform like a strong energy policy /.
Uh they want to talk about national issues as w- including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> but also border patrol and border security /.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> as I stood outside the polls for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">thirteen hours</ENAMEX> uh I never heard people talking about the war /.
They talked about issues that were uh more important and more local to them /.
Okay /.
What 's your <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">number one</ENAMEX> thing you 'd like to get done in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next year or so</ENAMEX> /?
My <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">number one</ENAMEX> thing is to address the needs of the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> congressional district /.
It 's very diverse /.
There are very many needs /.
Uh I want to follow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Portman 's</ENAMEX> style of uh continued leadership /.
And uh and uh I 'm to do that and uh answer and address their needs in the same manner that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Portman</ENAMEX> did /.
But what 's the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> specific thing you 'd like to do the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> bill you 'd like to pass the only policy you 'd like to see enacted /?
There are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> /.
Uh actually I 'd like to address sexual predators in a much better fashion /.
I 'd also like to address uh eminent domain /.
I think that there are bills al- already in place for that /.
and I 'd be proud to sp- -- to sign on and sponsor those bills /.
Okay thank you very much <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Schmidt</ENAMEX> /.
Congratulations to a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> as soon as she 's sworn in /.
When we come back what does the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> victory in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> mean for the President /?
And what does it say about the public support for the war right now /?
And later the congressional committee where baseball star <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raphael Romero</ENAMEX> testified he was steroid free /.
We 'll investigate his positive steroid test /.
You 're watching <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">msnbc</ENAMEX> /.
Welcome back to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> /.
More on that congressional race in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> and what it means for the rest of the country /.
We 're joined right now by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> congressman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherrod Brown</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Blackwell</ENAMEX> who 's also a candidate for governor who is in fact a candidate for governor /.
Uh Mr. Secretary thank you very much <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken</ENAMEX> for coming on the show /.
You 're running for governor /.
Are you worried that this uh strongly <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> district uh barely came through for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> candidate against an anti-war <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> /?
I you know I think it was a wake - up call particularly for those <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> that campaign like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> and then govern like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Dukakis</ENAMEX> /.
Uh what the -- what the base is saying is that we expect you to get up <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">every morning</ENAMEX> and be who you say you are and do what you say you 're going to do /.
And I think I that is a wake - up call /.
And if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republican party</ENAMEX> uh grasps that then we will go about the business of reestablishing the line of distinction between <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> particularly on fiscal matters because the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> do n't represent change /.
They are s- -- they 're not saying they want to cut taxes and grow out our economy and create jobs /.
They 're not saying they want a right - sized government to make sure that we check runaway state government spending and put more emphasis on the private sector /.
So they do n't represent any change but the change of being from the outside to the inside /.
And so <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> that are going to be successful <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> that show a real distinction between the status quo and getting our economy moving again by cutting taxes and right - sizing government /.
Okay let 's go to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherrod Brown</ENAMEX> /.
Thank you congressman /.
I think -- uh I think the Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> of your state seems like he 's trashing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> who 's running a half billion dollar <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">half trillion dollar</ENAMEX> deficit for not being a real conservative /.
Yeah I I look at who conservatives really are /.
I thought -- what I always learned was that they wanted smaller government uh not no no national debt and they wanted to stay out of foreign entanglements /.
and we 're seeing exactly the opposite /.
But what happened in southwest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blackwell</ENAMEX> 's right /.
it 's a -- it 's a wake - up call with a message /.
I do n't know what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Dukakis</ENAMEX> has to do with it /.
But the message clearly is that the ethical problems in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> the ties of this candidate that that barely squeaked through this election when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> carried that district <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> and the former congressman carried it almost <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> the ties she had to Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blackwell</ENAMEX> to Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taft</ENAMEX> to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> /-
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> made rowboat calls in to every <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> voter in that district /.
and and she barely won /.
I think that 's the message that /-
What does that mean in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> /?
I would n't want to be on the ballot <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> running for governor if I were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Blackwell</ENAMEX> or anyone else /.
Did you associate uh /-
I 'm not sure /-
not much internationally /.
Congressman do you associate with the remarks of uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Hackett</ENAMEX> the fellow who lost the race <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</ENAMEX> who used terms like son of a bitch and chicken hawk /?
Do you think those are appropriate terms to refer to the President of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> with /?
Well I think that uh Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hackett</ENAMEX> /-
Considering he was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> he did n't think the war was a good idea to begin with /.
He stood with his commander in chief /.
He has heard the President and the Vice President accuse uh people who disagree with his war policy like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Hackett</ENAMEX> /.
has accused them of not being patriotic /.
I think whatever Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hackett</ENAMEX> said was understandable /.
But the issue is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Hackett</ENAMEX> ran incredibly well when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> put his name on the line and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Taft</ENAMEX> put his name on the line in that district /.
And that tells you then both the national and the state problem the problems that both the national and state <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> have /.
Okay let me go to Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Blackwell</ENAMEX> /.
Mr. Secretary do you -- are you happy as a candidate for governor of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> with the way this war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> has been fought by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> /?
Are you happy with the progress and prosecution of this war /?
First <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> let me say that my my heart aches for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty</ENAMEX> families that that lost loved ones in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last forty eight hours</ENAMEX> /.
Uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Marines</ENAMEX> are from the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> /.
Uh what I -- what I am for is firm resolution and a strategy that will lead us to victory /.
I think the President , I think the Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Defense</ENAMEX> and all others who are responsible for offering that sort of leadership in this country has have those same objectives /.
And I think to try to undercut that resolve and to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> - guess the Commander in Chief is a mistake /.
Let me just say to you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> that what I said was that Ron- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> cut taxes and they started to restrain state government spending /.
What has happened in the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Taft</ENAMEX> has increased spending and he has in fact raised taxes /.
And I think that anybody that runs on a tax raising runaway spending platform is going to lose because they 're going to undercut our base /.
And let me say to the -- to the congressman that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Oversight Committee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bureau of Worker 's Comp</ENAMEX> where all the scandal is taking place has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> members /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> of those members are <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> /.
and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> is an independent /.
You know who <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> are is /?
It is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Berger</ENAMEX> who is the uh uh vice president -- excuse me is the president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AFL - CIO</ENAMEX> /.
He is a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DNC</ENAMEX> /.
He is a member of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ohio Democratic Party</ENAMEX> /.
This is a bipartisan scandal that 's going to take responsible and bipartisan leadership to to get involved /.
And I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> step to getting towards the bottom of the scandal in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> is to have guys like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Berger</ENAMEX> resign /.
Okay thank you very much /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Blackwell</ENAMEX> Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> congressman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherrod Brown</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> /.
When we come back Washington for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Washington Post</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Gowan</ENAMEX> will be here to tell us about his visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gitmo</ENAMEX> /.
He 's just been to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Guantanamo</ENAMEX> /.
He 's going to tell us what it smells like down there /.
And later in the program former slugger <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Conseco</ENAMEX> speaks up about steroids and baseball /.
This is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> only at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">msnbc</ENAMEX> /.
Welcome back to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> /.
With several <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> senators pushing to regulate the military 's treatment of detainees the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> has launched a major PR offensive and is inviting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> congressmen to spend a day touring the detention facility at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Guantanamo Bay</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington Post</ENAMEX> reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Gowan</ENAMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gitmo</ENAMEX> with a congressional delegation <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this Monday</ENAMEX> and is writing about the experience for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> 's paper /.
Mike I want you to give me the kind of report you give to your mother your friends /.
I want the richness the smell the color the whole thing /.
What is it like down in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Guantanamo</ENAMEX> for our guys watching those prisoners and interrogating them /?
What 's it like for the prisoners /?
Well for the prisoners uh I ca n't really tell you /.
We saw a very sanitized version of it /.
Um I went down with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> lawmakers /.
They spent <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</ENAMEX> on the ground at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gitmo</ENAMEX> /.
And then we saw the lawmakers from a distance /.
Uh eh they we /-
That 's inappropriate maybe /.
They saw the prisoners from a distance /.
Uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the things that they got to do was uh they visited an exercise cage with a concrete floor chain link uh walls and ceilings /.
Through the distance you could see like <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> uh detainee as they call it /.
There was a soccer ball there /.
Uh they sort of get um uh a feel for what uh recreation 's like /.
Now we 're told that they do that for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">everyday</ENAMEX> /.
Uh we come back /.
we ask the defense lawyers /.
They say yes but <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">that hour</ENAMEX> comes at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> uh when it 's dark and they ca n't see uh anything /.
But as you suggested there 's a bunch of these tours /.
There have been <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than fifty</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last three months</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than thirty</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last months</ENAMEX> /.
Uh that 's such a regular thing down there now that we went into the maximum security unit and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the doors was open /.
And I 'm like why 's the door open /?
And you walk up to it /.
and there 's a sign on it that says tour cell /. /.
So they 're used to uh having people come through /.
You go into a sample cell where they have the prisoners ' uh basic items comfort items laid out /.
and on the wall hanging off the wall there 's a book /.
and it says <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Holy Koran</ENAMEX> /.
So the idea is to show uh lawmakers the better part of what 's happening there /.
Each of the guides pointed out to us the black uh arrows that you see everywhere are showing where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mecca</ENAMEX> is /.
They point out to us that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> times a day uh they the pipe call to prayer is piped in /.
They 're free to join no matter what else uh they 're doing /.
What did you like to -- what did you want to see that you could n't <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX> /?
Well I would have liked to have seen an in a detainee as they 're called /.
Um uh we did n't talk to any detainees /.
The uh congressmen uh who had security clearances did see a brief uh interrogation /.
and uh it sounded -- the military said it was authentic /.
Uh basically it was an inmate who was arguing that he wanted to uh get back /-
He fought or something /.
He 'd been moved into one of the stiffer uh areas /.
and he was arguing to get back into the lower ones /.
But they make a big deal about how much negotiating is been doing /.
They say they use a lot of positive reinforcements /.
Offer these guys pizza , offer these guys ice cream um in return for information /.
Now what the congressmen are asking after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> , how much really useful information do these guys have /?
And that 's one of the problems /.
the a new general <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Hood</ENAMEX> who 's down there clearly wants to shape this place up /.
Does n't want <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">an Abu Ghraib</ENAMEX> on his hands /.
There are cameras everywhere /.
The command staff works inside the wire /.
But a separate question beyond the guys who are working down there is what 's going to be done with these people /?
And uh the military will admit to you at the moment it looks like the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five hundred</ENAMEX> people that are currently there are going to be there indefinitely and they do n't have any charges against them /.
Okay thank you very much <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Gowan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Washington Post</ENAMEX> /.
Up next is it time for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> to step in and straighten out steroid use in professional baseball /?
How about getting rid of it /?
This is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> only on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">msnbc</ENAMEX> /.
Good <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</ENAMEX> everyone /.
I 'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collette Cassidy</ENAMEX> /.
Here 's what 's happening /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> marines were killed when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haditha</ENAMEX> in western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
It is the deadliest such attack yet on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> forces /.
All fourteen marines were from the same reserve unit based near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> /.
Another <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> marines from that same unit were killed in an ambush in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haditha</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Discovery</ENAMEX> astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Robinson</ENAMEX> easily removed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> worrisome pieces of gap filler material from under the shuttle /.
There was concern it could lead to a repeat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Columbia</ENAMEX> disaster during re-entry /.
Meantime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">@NASA</ENAMEX> says it may decide by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> whether another space walk will be needed to fix torn thermal blanket that blew a cockpit window /.
There 's a concern it could also pose a danger during re-entry /.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Stewart 's</ENAMEX> release from home confinement and her electronic ankle bracelet has now been delayed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</ENAMEX> /.
That 's after she reportedly showed up at a yoga class near her estate north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> /.
Those are your headlines /.
I 'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collette Cassidy</ENAMEX> /.
Now back to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> /.
Welcome back to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> /.
Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March</ENAMEX> some of baseball 's most well known superstars were called to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> to testify on steroid use in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">major league baseball</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of those in the hot seat denying he ever used steroids was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafael Palmeiro</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Baltimore Orioles</ENAMEX> /.
My name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafael Palmeiro</ENAMEX> /.
and I am a professional baseball player /.
I will be brief in my remarks <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> /.
Let me start by telling you this I have never used steroids period /.
I do not know how to say it any more clearly than that /.
Never /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Major league baseball</ENAMEX> does n't agree /.
The league suspended <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmeiro</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> for flunking a drug test /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The New York Times</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> reported he had a potent steroid in his system . The same that caused <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> sprinter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Johnson</ENAMEX> to lose his <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> gold medal back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eighty - eight</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> former major leaguer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Conseco</ENAMEX> who wrote about injecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmeiro</ENAMEX> with steroids in his book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Juiced</ENAMEX> responded to his suspension /.
You have to be careful now because uh the extensions may be too extreme /.
For example if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmeiro</ENAMEX> is abiding by the rules , if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmeiro</ENAMEX> is not using steroids right now and a metabolyte has been found in his system he 's found guilty which makes -- which makes no sense /.
But that 's his fault /.
A lot of the players /-
Is n't it -- is n't it that his fault <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose</ENAMEX> if he lie -- if he said he never ever used steroids then he tests positive . And then he says oh that 's from a previous drug use /.
That 's his contradiction that he created , is n't it /?
Well i- it 's a contradiction on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> subject matter /.
On <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> time frame and not o- on another /.
There are going to be many athletes who uh once this drug testing program was instituted are going to be found uh guilty /.
Uh their urine sample is going to come out positive because there will be strong metabolytes /.
But why do n't they just say I used /-
But that does n't mean they 're not abiding by the rules /.
Okay I do n't want to interrupt you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> /.
but but why do n't they admit they broke the rules before so the new drug test will be found to be positive because of previous use /.
then they wo n't be nailed again /?
It 's very simple /.
They do n't have enough information enough knowledge on how long a metabolyte lasts in an athlete 's system /.
Well now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House uh Government Reform Committee</ENAMEX> which held those hearings back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March</ENAMEX> is requesting from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Major League Baseball</ENAMEX> the documents relating to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmeiro</ENAMEX> 's drug test /.
They want the drug test results on paper /.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmeiro</ENAMEX> says he will cooperate with the committee /.
Congressman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Lynch</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> is a member of the committee and is now with us from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> /.
Congressman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynch</ENAMEX> are you uh uh /-
uh you want to get a hold of those documents those drug test results right from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmeiro</ENAMEX> /?
Certainly it would -- uh it would answer the question that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canseco</ENAMEX> has raised about how long uh it was in his system and whether or not it was from a residual use /.
What difference does it make whether he lied before and was using before and is found out now or he 's been using lately /?
Well if if he was using steroids during his testimony or prior to his testimony obviously he has committed perjury and has tried to mislead the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> in a -- in an ongoing investigation /.
So uh it it has uh a lot to do about what happens next /.
Would you like to see him charged with perjury if he did -- h- uh if there 's evidence now hard evidence to a drug test that he was in fact using steroids back then before the testimony /?
Because there 's only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> options here as you point out /.
and you elucidate this /.
If he 's used the drugs and never used them before since the hearings that 's almost insane to think he did that /.
Yeah /.
So is uh his defense or the defense that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canseco</ENAMEX> offered on this show <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</ENAMEX> was that he may have used them a while ago in other words before he testified that he never had , therefore he 's guilty of perjury /.
Right /.
I 'm not sure if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canseco</ENAMEX> is just offering his opinion uh uh /.
Certainly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmeiro</ENAMEX> never contested the the positive result on the test /.
Uh so we have n't actually got him in /.
He 's agreed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> to verbally to release all the documents /.
However I I believe that the committee needs to get a similar release from the union because the confidentiality agreement is part of a collective bargaining agreement /.
so we need to go to that step as well /.
Yeah but assuming you get by that step do you think this guy should be hit with a perjury charge /?
Well if he -- if he meets the requirements yes /.
We 're trying to protect the process /.
When people come before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> and they are sworn to testify truthfully there has to be consequences when they do not do so /.
So this is about the integrity of the congressional process /.
This is not about going after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmeiro</ENAMEX> /.
We had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Garibaldi</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</ENAMEX> who lost his son to uh steroid use /.
He 's an athlete /.
He was trying to make it as a young man /.
He was using steroids to get ahead in that uh baseball career /.
Uh there are a lot of young people out there now watching this program right now probably who may be in their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen year old</ENAMEX> era <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">from eighteen to twenty one</ENAMEX> /.
They 're thinking about how they can break into the big leagues /.
Is this a -- is this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten day</ENAMEX> suspension enough to turn them off to drugs /?
It 's really a joke if you think about it /.
If a person -- and if if if a non-athlete a non-celebrity is is uh convicted of simple possession of a -- of a -- of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">schedule three</ENAMEX> substance like like these steroids uh there 's a potential for a year in jail /.
This eh in this case <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmeiro</ENAMEX> 's looking at a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten day</ENAMEX> suspension /.
He still makes <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">over two point eight million dollars</ENAMEX> a year /.
Uh He 's uh t- rumored to be considered for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Hall of Fame</ENAMEX> /.
So it it really -- uh the the penalty in baseball i- is really an incentive uh to take the chance /.
I mean there 's -- there 's very little consequences uh other than his reputation of course for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmeiro</ENAMEX> /.
You 're not at all prejudiced being a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sox</ENAMEX> fan , are you here /?
/.
I 'm serious /.
Well /.
I mean you might be tougher on him /-
I 'll take the /- /.
Would you be just as tough on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sox</ENAMEX> player /?
Oh of course of course /.
Let 's take a look at something that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Canseco</ENAMEX> said here <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</ENAMEX> /.
I want people to understand /.
I said this many times /.
My attack was never on these athletes /.
Uh I respect these athletes greatly /.
What I needed was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of these athletes who I name in the actual book who are well known uh individuals to come forth and say you know what what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose</ENAMEX> 's saying is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">one hundred percent</ENAMEX> true /.
Um my major attack and my -- and my only attack was on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Major League Baseball</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Player 's Association</ENAMEX> because I think that they ought to be you know exploited and found out for uh the corrupt methods they use for letting steroids in the game for endorsing steroids in the -- in the game of baseball /.
And all of a sudden you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bud Segal</ENAMEX> says I do n't know anything about it /.
I never say anything /.
That 's ridiculous /.
It 's the biggest ongoing joke on the planet right now /.
Congressman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynch</ENAMEX> you 're concerned about the rights of labor and collective bargaining agreements /.
And certainly many of us are here as well in this country generally /.
And uh so I respect you /.
so let me ask you this though /.
Do you think the unions have done the job here /?
Is it fair to say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canseco</ENAMEX> 's got it right by saying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Player 's Association</ENAMEX> has not been aggressive in getting rid of steroids /?
Well I do n't think it 's a union problem /.
Why not a union /-
/.
Why is n't it a union problem /?
Well well /-
If they 're protecting the players ' rights and saying they should n't be tested /.
You watch those lawyers in your committee /.
They 're up there -- they were all over the place trying to defend eh the players /.
Hey I 'm a former union president myself and and also an attorney that represented a lot of unions /.
I always thought a very strong anti-drug policy was a good thing for my union members /.
This is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> case where they have turned a blind eye to what 's going on in professional sports /.
But that 's -- that 's not the typical position of unions /.
No /.
They usually want a strong anti-drug policy to make a better workforce /.
Well of course it 's also for safety reasons at the workplace /.
But about uh b- let 's get back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MLB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Major League Baseball</ENAMEX> /.
Do you think Bud Segal -- do you believe the whole major league uh establishment has been benefitting from all these homeruns <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">all these years</ENAMEX> and big muscles that produce these homeruns /?
Absolutely /.
Following the strike I think the the thing that brought people back to baseball was was the big homerun contest between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sosa</ENAMEX> and and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maguire</ENAMEX> eh . And and in a very real way steroid use /.
if those <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> gentlemen uh you know were guilty of it and there 's -- there 's some evidence that they were uh they put people back into the seats /.
So baseball is benefitting by by the performance enhancement of the individual players which which makes it even more troublesome in terms of eradicating steroid use /.
Congressman when you and I were growing up in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifties and sixties</ENAMEX> baseball players were skinny wiry guys /.
They weighed <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">under two hundred pounds</ENAMEX> /.
Do you think it was drug use or or weight training that got them so strong and big /?
I I think that it 's a combination of both /.
I I think that there 's -- there 's some steroid use out there now /.
I think we probably have it moving in the right direction /.
And I think if we come up with serious penalties like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Olympic Commission</ENAMEX> has that uh we can do this /.
I know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Davis</ENAMEX> uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> and and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Ma- Waxman</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Clean Sports Act</ENAMEX> that we 're -- we 're trying to get put through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> /.
Yeah /.
So so I think -- I think this this may help us this recent revelation uh about a player who had everything to lose but who still apparently put steroids in his body /.
You know he had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Hall of Fame</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three thousand</ENAMEX> hits and the endorsements and uh really the the respect and admiration of the entire country /.
Okay /.
Is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafael Palmeiro</ENAMEX> in trouble with your committee sir /?
He may be /.
I think it 's too early to say /.
Okay /.
Thank you very much Congressman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Lynch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> /.
Coming up , a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">gallop</ENAMEX> poll shows a big lead for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy Giuliani</ENAMEX> in presidential matchups with guess who <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Rodham Clinton</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> only on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">msnbc</ENAMEX> /.
Welcome back to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> troops were killed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> when a roadside bomb ripped through their lightly armored vehicle /.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">earlier today</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> again rejected calls for a timetable for withdrawal of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> troops from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
The violence in recent days in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> is a grim reminder of the enemies we face /.
These terrorists and insurgents will use brutal tactics because they 're trying to shake the will of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States of America</ENAMEX> /.
That 's what they 're trying to do /.
They want us to retreat /.
They want us in our compassion for the innocent say we 're through /.
That 's what they want /.
They will fail /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> political strategist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Shrum</ENAMEX> is now a senior fellow at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New York University 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Graduate School in Public Service</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Rogers</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> political consultant who served in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> /.
What do you make of that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed</ENAMEX> the president 's speech <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> /?
Because everywhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> we 're hearing that although there 's not a timetable set that we are beginning to be pull out our troops come next spring after the elections over there /.
Well you 're hearing that in bits and pieces /.
and and you can believe that /.
or you can believe what the president said that he wo n't be shaken , his resolve is is there and there is no timetable /.
From a top general /.
And you got to think that 's right /.
There is no timetable /.
Uh and if we were to telegraph that it would only be encouragement /.
it would only be aiding the people who want us to get out and the terrorists and the killers that uh that want us to leave /.
It 's not exactly inconsistent /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Shrum</ENAMEX> the President did not shoot down the notion that we 're going to bring begin to remove large numbers of troops back home after the elections <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> /.
How do you read what he 's saying /?
Well they 're <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - timing this timetable issue /.
The fact is that we have major generals who are sending out the very signals that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed</ENAMEX> says we ca n't afford to send out because there 's so much dissatisfaction in the country for the course of the war /.
The answer to failure is not to perpetuate it /.
And either the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> as Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biden</ENAMEX> has said , as Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerry</ENAMEX> has said are going to get the capacity in a serious way to defend themselves or they 're not /.
And if they do n't we ca n't have an indefinite <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
It wo n't work /.
and the country wo n't accept it /.
Let me ask you about this election we just had /.
Yeah /.
Eh I we all love bi-elections because we try to find something in the tea leaves /.
Right /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifty - two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">forty - eight</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> won in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> district narrower victory than usual /.
But what 's interesting is this guy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Hackett</ENAMEX> who was on this show <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> used the most amazing language to describe -- in describing the President of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> /.
He called him I do n't use this phrase often son of a bitch /.
I understand /.
He called him a chickenhawk /.
We know what that means /.
And he still got <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">forty - eight percent</ENAMEX> /.
Ed Rogers /.
Well there was a lot about this race that was an aberration /.
He was a good articulate candidate /.
He used some harsh language that I would disagree with /.
but nonetheless he had a legitimate point of view /.
And and and he was the darling of the media and of the left /.
He had a lot of resources in a special election where there was turnout that was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than half</ENAMEX> of what would normally turn out in a normal election in a regularly scheduled election /.
And the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> should n't take too much comfort in an election where they just got beat versus an election where they got slaughtered /.
So /-
Shrum <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Shrum</ENAMEX> what do you make of this /?
/.
That was a nice piece of spin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed</ENAMEX> /.
but the fact is that /-
But it was all true /.
But the /-
It was a nice piece of spin /.
Right /.
And the fact is that district is normally won by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">forty</ENAMEX> points /.
They won by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> points /.
If you see that kind of shift or anything approaching that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> or something much less than that you 're going to see <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteen ninety four</ENAMEX> in reverse /.
And what I think it really reflects is not any language that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Hackett</ENAMEX> used /-
/.
He might have actually done better had he not said some of those things /.
What it really reflects is dissatisfaction with the war a failed privatization plan on social security and a sense that the President has put no priority on healthcare and education /.
And I think people want some action on those things /.
Let 's talk <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> /.
I love the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">gallop</ENAMEX> poll /.
It just came out <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> /.
It shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy Giuliani</ENAMEX> has got a sixty four percent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">sixty four percent</ENAMEX> favor in this environment when everybody 's tough on politicians /.
And and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> 's down at four <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifty one</ENAMEX> /.
But you know I get -- I get -- I want to ask you /.
I 've been pushing this /.
Maybe I feel like I 'm campaign - managing for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> /.
Maybe you should be /.
No I 'm just telling you he is the best speaker in the country <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> now that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Jackson</ENAMEX> 's not active /.
He 's the best orator in the country /.
And I think he looks great /.
What do you think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed</ENAMEX> /?
Hey and he 's a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> /.
and if he runs he 's going to be a contender /.
You know <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> are very +hierarchial /.
We tend to nominate a frontrunner /.
And right now I think by any standard <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> is a frontrunner /.
And behind him /-
Not in most polls /.
Most polls show <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">number one</ENAMEX> /.
/.
Okay okay well give or take /.
Yeah /.
Uh b- but nonetheless he would be a contender for our nomination no question /.
He would ultimately have some ideological problems /.
but right now yeah he is /.
he 's a frontrunner /.
/.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> you 're laughing because you know he has them /.
But is n't -- parties that are in trouble and need to win and if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> 's the nominee , they 're going to need to win , they 're going to need the strongest possible opponent wo n't they resort to a Giuliani /?
No he 's -- look h- he can be a contender /.
He ca n't be the nominee /.
And I 'll tell you <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Rogers</ENAMEX> is n't going to run his campaign /.
so you might as well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> /.
/.
Uh this is -- this is somebody who is explicitly pro-choice who has been for gay rights who while you might diasgree with him on a whole set of other issues is on those issues is more like a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> than a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> /.
And the fact of the matter is that when the right wing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republican party</ENAMEX> takes a look at him and takes a look at his positions on values issues they 're going to reject him /.
They do n't want him appointing /-
What happened in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifty</ENAMEX> /-
They do n't want him appointing /-
I hate to be an old man here /.
but in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteen fifty - two</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> looked at probable defeat /.
They thought they were going to run against maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truman</ENAMEX> again /.
They did n't know by then /.
They ran <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dwight Eisenhower</ENAMEX> /.
They ran a moderate /.
How do you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> wo n't be smart enough to do the same thing to beat <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> /?
We were n't -- we were n't a country fractured along these social issues as in the way that we are now /.
Look at what 's happening <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Frist</ENAMEX> because he 's changed his position on stem cell research has been disinvited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Family Research Council</ENAMEX> to what they 're calling their <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Second Justice Sunday</ENAMEX> /.
Instead they 're going to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom DeLay</ENAMEX> /.
I mean you have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">a Republican party</ENAMEX> where certain lines just are n't going to be crossed /.
And I do n't believe a pro-choice and even mildly pro-gay - rights candidate can be nominated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> /.
I know better than to try to forecast a race <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> out particularly in the primaries the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> primaries /.
However I am a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> that tends to underestimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> /.
We know what a winning <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> nominee looks like /.
It looks like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Carter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> /.
It does n't look like a liberal senator from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> /.
Okay we 're going to go back and look at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> 's numbers which I find fascinating /.
They 're probably bad news for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> supporters /.
We 'll be right back with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Rogers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Shrum</ENAMEX> /.
Stay with us /.
When we return , could there be a unity ticket in the presidential race of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two thousand eight</ENAMEX> /?
We 've a little buzz about that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> /.
This is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> only on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">msnbc</ENAMEX> /.
We 're back with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> strategist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Rogers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Harball</ENAMEX> political analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Shrum</ENAMEX> /.
Let 's look at these <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> numbers /.
I find them fascinating /.
Favorability <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fifty three percent</ENAMEX> in our latest gallop poll /.
Unfavorable <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">forty - three</ENAMEX> /.
In other words she starts the race <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> with a pretty high negative /.
Oh yeah but I think for her to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</ENAMEX> point advantage favorable unfavorable and the fact that she 's running a race with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> and is as close as she is in this poll I think it 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">forty - five</ENAMEX> tells you that she 's actually a strong candidate /.
Now I do n't think that she probably appreciates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Rogers '</ENAMEX> quasi-endorsement /.
/.
It kind -- it kind of reminds of when /-
/.
It kind of reminds me of when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> said to me in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two thousand</ENAMEX> please stop saying nice things about me /.
it 's hurting me in the Republican primaries /.
Right /.
Uh but she -- but I uh /-
/.
Do you think she 's the strongest <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> candidate for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two thousand and eight</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Shrum</ENAMEX> /?
I think we do n't know the answer to that yet /.
But I know this that and you 'll remember this <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> there were a lot of people in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> campaign in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteen eighty</ENAMEX> who when they thought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> was going to be the nominee were popping champagne corks because they thought he was easy to beat /.
I know /.
The truth is he was n't easy to beat /.
She is a tough smart resourceful politician with a sense of where she 'd like to take the country /.
And I think she 'd be a very strong candidate /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Rogers</ENAMEX> do you think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> could take the uh the beefier uh industrial states where the men have votes and guns and tend to like traditional women like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> /?
Yeah /.
Do you think they would like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> the cut of her jib out there /?
I I ca n't think of a red state that that is is threatened /.
I mean some of the blue states I 'm talking about /.
Eh uh probably not /.
I mean she would have a headwind in this campaign /.
Again uh we know what a winning <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> nominee looks like /.
and it does n't look like a liberal senator from the northeast /.
You know I just wonder whether the same people that /-
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> the same people that vote for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingle</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> do you think are going to vote for Hillary Clinton /?
No /.
Oh I think -- I think -- if if if we have the situation we have on the war , if our foreign policy disarray if there 's no -- if no progress is being made on healthcare and education I think a lot of those red states could become blue states /.
Oh okay well that helps everybody right yeah /.
If things go as bad /-
Well if this war continues as it 's going <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peewee Herman</ENAMEX> could win /.
I mean you make your point <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> /.
Let 's take a look /.
No /.
Here 's Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Biden</ENAMEX> last night on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</ENAMEX> /.
We 're talking about a possible unity ticket here /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> is a personal friend a great friend /.
and I would be honored to run with or against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> because I think the country would be better off uh would be well off no matter who /-
And I mean /-
Did I hear -- did I hear with /?
You know um uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> uh I and I think uh /-
Do n't become cottage cheese my friend /.
say it /.
The answer 's yes /.
Uh I I I hope John -- I wanted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> to run with uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kerry</ENAMEX> last time out /.
And I uh asked him to do that /.
Boy I would love to see politics be shaken up in a way that just completely blew out the ramparts of partisanship /.
that would just be a wonderful situation /.
I do n't know if <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Daily Show</ENAMEX> is calling the shots <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Shrum</ENAMEX> /.
but do you think that 's even possible the idea of a fusion ticket between uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biden</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> /?
What would Ed -- what would <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed</ENAMEX> and I do if they blew up the ramparts of partisanship /?
/.
Well I do n't know /.
but the country might do better /.
we know it /.
be over /.
It 's not going to happen /.
There there are real differences between the parties here /.
There are real differences on some big issues /.
That 's right /.
And you notice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Biden</ENAMEX> would like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> to run with him /.
I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> 's running for president in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republican Party</ENAMEX> /.
Yes /.
And I do n't think he 's going to pick <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Biden</ENAMEX> as his vice-presidential nominee if he gets nominated /.
and I do n't think the convention would go along with him /.
Let me ask you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed</ENAMEX> since you 're the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> of this duo do you think your party will become pragmatic when it becomes closer and closer to the prospect of not only confronting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> in the general election in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two thousand eight</ENAMEX> but possibly losing to her /?
Will your party straighten up and say damn it we have to drop some of our ideological baggage /.
we 've got to run the best possible candidate /?
You know in Feb- t- -- uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February and March of two thousand and eight</ENAMEX> pragmatism and a calculating -- a collective calculus on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> primary voters will not be what carries the day /.
I mean our voters will probably go with a stylistical contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> somewhat /.
Voters usually do /.
Sure a little change /.
We tend to nominate a front runner /.
So a front runner in our party has to really falter before we 'll go back into the pack /.
But is there going to be some sort of collective calculus /?
Whose turn is it /?
$Whose turn for is it party /?
No /.
Is it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> 's turn having lost last time or not /?
Historically speaking yes /.
If he were to tend to it , if he were to listen to his advisors and try he would be hard to beat /.
Right /.
Is he the hardest r- party uh party uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> candidate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> to beat <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> /?
Uh well I I think everything /-
You know to be honest I think he /-
To be honest I think he probably is /.
but of course my saying it may in fact convey the opposite impression to people /.
People may think I 'm trying to convey the opposite impression /.
Ah he is -- he 's /-
But you 're a professor now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> you 're a professor /.
They believe you as a professor /.
/.
You speak from the academic chair now /.
By the way what is it the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrum</ENAMEX> chair /?
/.
/.
What do you call your /-
