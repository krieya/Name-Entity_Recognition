The sudden `` flight to quality '' that triggered <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's explosive bond - market rally was reversed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> in a `` flight from quality '' rout .
The setback , in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bond prices plummeted , reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit - taking .
`` It was a pretty wild day .
Our markets were closely tied to the stock market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Kazis</ENAMEX> , manager of trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Smith Barney , Harris Upham -AMP- Co</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its legs , '' he said .
Some fixed - income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 200</ENAMEX> - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
That caused investors to flee stocks and buy high - quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds , which are safer than other types of securities .
But when stocks began to climb instead , prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds declined .
Contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios .
Among the firms were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc</ENAMEX> .
The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 1/2 %</ENAMEX> .
The closely watched rate on federal funds , or overnight loans between banks , slid to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 3/4 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> , down from its perceived target level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9 %</ENAMEX> .
The rate is considered an early signal of changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> policy .
Traders said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's modest easing did n't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected .
In fact , some economists contend that the latest easing started <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> .
Others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond , ended <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1 3/4</ENAMEX> points lower , or down <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 17.50</ENAMEX> for each $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> face amount .
The reversal was even more evident among shorter - term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bill rates plummeted <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 0.70</ENAMEX> percentage point on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , they gave back <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three - fourths</ENAMEX> of that amount <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
The bond - equivalent yield on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - month</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills , for example , was quoted late <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.72 %</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.16 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
Investment - grade corporate bonds , mortgage - backed securities and municipal bonds also fell .
But prices of junk bonds , which were battered <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> in near standstill trading , rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session .
Junk bonds opened <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as four</ENAMEX> points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed .
Some traders said the high - yield market was helped by active institutional buying .
In particular , they said , firms such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels .
`` I think the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high - yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lonski</ENAMEX> , an economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moody 's Investors Service Inc</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds were higher in overnight trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , which opened at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">about 7:30 p.m. EDT</ENAMEX> .
The benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond , for example rose <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> point in early <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> trading in reaction to a quick <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</ENAMEX> - point drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stock market .
But as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> stocks rebounded , Treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher .
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> trading operations , wanting to keep a watchful eye on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> trading as an indication of where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> trading would begin , were fully staffed during the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> trading session .
`` Most of the action was during the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> session , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Moore</ENAMEX> , trading manager at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Continental Bank</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Goldinger</ENAMEX> , who often trades overnight for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capital Insight Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , said trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> was `` very active '' but highly volatile .
`` We went down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/4</ENAMEX> point in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</ENAMEX> right before lunch , then after lunch we went up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/4</ENAMEX> point in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">12 minutes</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , trading is halted during <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">lunchtime</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> 's market turned out to be a bad bellwether for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> trading .
When the market opened here , bonds prices fell as the stock market regained strength .
The bond market 's focus on stock activity was so strong <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> that it overshadowed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's slate of economic data , which includes the government 's report on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> merchandise trade and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> industrial production .
Industrial production is expected to have declined <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</ENAMEX> , according to a consensus of economists surveyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow Jones Capital Markets Report</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> trade deficit is expected to have widened to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.1 billion</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.58 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> .
A widening of that magnitude , said one <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> trader , is `` not a favorable number ... .
It could do damage to us . ''
Meanwhile , agency supply is expected to weigh heavily on the market <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Home Loan Bank</ENAMEX> prices a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.3 billion</ENAMEX> offering of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one - year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> maturities .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tomorrow</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Resolution Funding Corp.</ENAMEX> will provide details of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> bond issue , which is expected to total <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 4 billion and $ 6 billion</ENAMEX> and carry a maturity greater than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Resolution Funding</ENAMEX> is a division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX> , the new federal agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Tennessee Valley Authority</ENAMEX> plans to price a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</ENAMEX> offering , its first public debt borrowing in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</ENAMEX> .
`` There 's lots of supply , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> trader said .
`` We have a couple or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three tough weeks</ENAMEX> coming . ''
