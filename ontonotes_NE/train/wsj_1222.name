Residents of this city soon will be seeing ads urging them to visit `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> 's outdoor museum '' -- <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake View Cemetery</ENAMEX> .
Despite such famous tenants as oil magnate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John D. Rockefeller</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake View Cemetery</ENAMEX> has fallen on hard times .
So the inner - city burial ground is trying to resurrect itself with a television advertising campaign .
The ads celebrate the achievements of some of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake View 's</ENAMEX> residents .
A spot honoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill White</ENAMEX> , the inventor of chewing gum , shows a woman trying to extricate her high - heeled shoe from a wad of gum .
Another focuses on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Brush</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> person to light a city electrically .
It shows a boy hurling rocks at a street lamp .
Street lights , the ad points out , `` helped sharpen the arm of many a budding baseball player . ''
Cemetery officials hope the ads , which will begin airing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</ENAMEX> , will not only draw visitors but bolster burials and endowment fund contributions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake View</ENAMEX> had an operating deficit <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> and has a poor reputation as an out - of - repair and crime - infested cemetery .
The private , non-profit cemetery has had trouble competing against its for - profit counterparts , which use direct mail and other advertising to sell lots .
`` We do n't want to be known as ambulance chasers , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Garrison</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake View 's</ENAMEX> president .
`` We want people to think of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake View</ENAMEX> as an historical park and educational experience ... .
A pleasant place to come and spend <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</ENAMEX> . ''
Not all of the cemetery 's better - known tenants lend themselves to the promotional job at hand , however .
For example , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James A. Garfield</ENAMEX> is entombed here , the victim of an assassination in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1881</ENAMEX> .
-LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garrison</ENAMEX> notes , however , that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garfield</ENAMEX> tomb is one of the nation 's premier examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Romanesque</ENAMEX> architecture . -RRB-
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> , buried beneath a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">180 - foot</ENAMEX> - tall granite obelisk , did n't seem right for an ad either .
The oil magnate , who spent his <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">later years</ENAMEX> passing out dimes to counter his penny - pinching image , `` is n't terribly amusing , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Olson</ENAMEX> , creative director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Innis - Maggiore - Olson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , which is producing the ads .
But there are plenty of other promising prospects at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake View</ENAMEX> , promoters believe : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Ball</ENAMEX> , for instance , who wrote `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">When Irish Eyes are Smiling</ENAMEX> , '' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garrett Morgan</ENAMEX> , the inventor of the gas mask and the tri-colored traffic light .
