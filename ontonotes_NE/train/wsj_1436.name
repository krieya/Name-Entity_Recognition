The neighborhood around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Alexander Haagen Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vermont - Slauson Shopping Center</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Watts</ENAMEX> section of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> resembles the crime - ridden , deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly is n't the sort of area one would choose to visit .
But turn into the shopping center 's parking lot , and one could be in the safe , busy mall of a prosperous suburb .
Only it is safer , and busier .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</ENAMEX> there have been <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</ENAMEX> burglary , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> thefts of or from autos , no purse - snatchings , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> attempted robbery in the mall , which opened in late <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> .
A shopping center of similar size in an affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> suburb would , per year , be expected to have <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> burglaries , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</ENAMEX> thefts of or from autos , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> robberies .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Watts</ENAMEX> mall has <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 350</ENAMEX> per leasable square foot ; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">200</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Haagen</ENAMEX> shopping centers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Watts</ENAMEX> area are doing almost as well .
A successful low - crime mall in a high - crime area violates the more typical inner - city pattern , in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth , gangs , and the criminal element , with an erosion of the customer base , development capital , and insurability .
Major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom - and - pop operations offering poorer - quality merchandise at higher prices .
Along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents .
Thus there is even more to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Vermont - Slauson Center</ENAMEX> than a good place to shop .
This defensible commercial zone becomes , for the residents , a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape , evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible .
The center improves the community image to outsiders as well , and may help to arrest , or even reverse , the exodus of capital and investment .
An additional benefit is the creation of jobs .
This starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers .
It continues through the life of the center ; <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Vermont - Slauson Center</ENAMEX> has created <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> permanent private - sector jobs at a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - time cost in public funds of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 2,500</ENAMEX> per job .
As many of these jobs are filled by local residents , who move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls , the $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,500</ENAMEX> - per - job public investment should repay itself in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</ENAMEX> .
And that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales , real estate , licenses and the like .
Profits are also plowed back into the community ; the non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vermont - Slauson Economic Development Corp.</ENAMEX> receives <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> of the profits from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Vermont - Slauson Center</ENAMEX> and uses the money to provide moderate and low - cost housing in the community -- now running into the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of units -- as well as commercial and industrial development projects .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradford Crowe</ENAMEX> , director of the mayor 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">City Economic Development Office</ENAMEX> , says : `` There is no question that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vermont - Slauson</ENAMEX> had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood .
What had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock , thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vermont - Slauson</ENAMEX> yields . ''
Another benefit is that substantial percentages of the proprietors in these centers are minority businessmen and women .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Grand Boulevard Plaza</ENAMEX> developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Matanky Realty Group</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Third Ward</ENAMEX> , opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Robert Taylor Homes</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29 %</ENAMEX> of the stores to date have been leased to blacks and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</ENAMEX> to members of other minority groups .
Children from the community will have worthier role models than the drug kingpins .
So what 's the catch ?
Primarily that putting <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of these inner - city deals together takes time , patience , breadth of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers possess .
Security costs are also quite high .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of these centers can involve years of negotiating with numerous public agencies , local political leaders , and citizen groups , and with prospective tenants and sources of financing .
Suburban deals are not without their delays and complications -- inner - city deals just have more of them .
Security at a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Haagen</ENAMEX> inner - city center is impressive , but unobtrusive .
The entire site is enclosed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 - to - 8 - foot</ENAMEX> - high ornamental iron fence with a small number of remote - controlled gates .
Shrubs and flowers give it a pleasing and non-fortress - like appearance .
Infrared motion detectors and closed - circuit TV cameras monitor the entire center ; lighting levels are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three to five</ENAMEX> times the industry standard .
The security command post , camouflaged as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> - story retail space , has its own `` crow 's nest '' above the roofs of the other buildings , with a panoramic view of the entire center .
Local law enforcement is present in a sub-station occupying space donated by the center .
These features are also used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Matanky Realty Group 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Boulevard Plaza</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Haagen</ENAMEX> has its own large security force of well - trained and well - paid personnel on round - the - clock duty at each center .
Security is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 % to 70 %</ENAMEX> of the common area charges of these centers , vs. an industry average of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 %</ENAMEX> .
These security costs are kept off - budget because the centers ' site acquisition , construction , and financing costs were reduced by such programs as Urban Development Action Grants , Economic Development Administration Grants , Community Development Block Grants , tax - free Industrial Development Bonds , Enterprise Zone tax write - offs , city infrastructure grants , and tax increment financing .
Many of these programs no longer exist , or have been severely cut back .
However , since these centers appear to pay for themselves , there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from enacting legislation with similar provisions .
Many states already have Enterprise Zones and legislation that combines tax incentives , loans , and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities .
These programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning , identifying sources of funds , and for acquiring a site and preparing it .
Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner - city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date .
With many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping centers , inner - city areas may represent a major new untapped market for investment .
New approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets .
If the risks and rewards are reasonable , developers will respond .
Government officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage development in high - risk areas should visit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vermont - Slauson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Boulevard Plaza</ENAMEX> and decide for themselves .
The answer will be obvious .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titus</ENAMEX> is a researcher at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Justice Department 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Institute of Justice</ENAMEX> .
