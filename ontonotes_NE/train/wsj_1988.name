<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> , which is preparing to speed up tariff cuts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , recorded a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47 %</ENAMEX> narrowing in its trade surplus with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Statistics Canada</ENAMEX> , a federal agency , reported .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> exports to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> jumped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.2 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> imports from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2.7 %</ENAMEX> .
As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> 's trade surplus with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> narrowed to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 656.5 million</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 558 million</ENAMEX> -RRB- in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 1.23 billion</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 1.04 billion</ENAMEX> -RRB- in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> exports benefited in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> from heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> spending on new plant and equipment and a pickup in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> auto demand , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> officials said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> , which do more trade than any other pair of nations , are to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</ENAMEX> to arrange an acceleration of planned tariff cuts under the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - Canada free trade agreement .
Industries in both countries have requested a speedup of tariff cuts on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of products .
Some tariffs were eliminated when the trade pact took effect <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 1</ENAMEX> .
The remainder were to be phased out in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> installments , with all tariffs eliminated by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1998</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> countries aim to reach an agreement by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early December</ENAMEX> on a package of accelerated tariff cuts that would take effect <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early next year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> officials said the trade pact has kindled an export interest among many small <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> companies that previously had little or no foreign sales .
For such businessmen , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> government is organizing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</ENAMEX> missions <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> states bordering on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> .
The businessmen are introduced to potential agents and distributors and instructed in trade procedures .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The U.S. Commerce Department</ENAMEX> is planning to try out similar trips on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> businessmen in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">coming months</ENAMEX> under its Canada First ! Outreach Program .
Participants in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> missions to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> are to be assisted by members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Service Corps of Retired Executives</ENAMEX> , a volunteer group , in dealing with their export challenges .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> government also has recently opened new trade offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Princeton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> , bringing the total number of such <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> offices in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> trade promotion offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> 's export effort has been blunted by robust home market demand and by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 %</ENAMEX> appreciation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> dollar against its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> counterpart in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</ENAMEX> that has made <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> goods more costly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> 's trade surplus with all countries narrowed to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 203.5 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 528.3 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Statistics Canada</ENAMEX> said .
