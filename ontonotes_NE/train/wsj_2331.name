If a hostile predator emerges for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi -AMP- Saatchi Co.</ENAMEX> , co-founders <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Saatchi</ENAMEX> will lead a management buy - out attempt , an official close to the company said .
Financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's stock - market sell - off in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and turmoil in the junk - bond market .
But the beleaguered <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> advertising and consulting giant , which <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> named a new chief executive officer to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Saatchi</ENAMEX> , has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi</ENAMEX> 's largest shareholder , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Southeastern Asset Management</ENAMEX> , said it had been approached by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> parties interested in a possible restructuring .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Spielvogel</ENAMEX> , chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi</ENAMEX> 's big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Backer Spielvogel Bates</ENAMEX> advertising unit , said he had offered to lead a management buy - out of the company , but was rebuffed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Saatchi</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielvogel</ENAMEX> said he would n't launch a hostile bid .
The executive close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi -AMP- Saatchi</ENAMEX> said that `` if a bidder came up with a ludicrously high offer , a crazy offer which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi</ENAMEX> knew it could n't beat , it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders .
But -LCB- otherwise -RCB- it would undoubtedly come back '' with an offer by management .
The executive said any buy - out would be led by the current board , whose chairman is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Saatchi</ENAMEX> and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Saatchi</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielvogel</ENAMEX> is n't part of the board , nor are any of the other heads of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi</ENAMEX> 's big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - based ad agencies .
The executive did n't name any price , but securities analysts have said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi</ENAMEX> would fetch upward of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</ENAMEX> .
The executive denied speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi</ENAMEX> was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy - back .
That speculation abounded <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Louis - Dreyfus</ENAMEX> , who joins <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi</ENAMEX> and becomes a member of its board on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 1</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis - Dreyfus</ENAMEX> , formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IMS International Inc.</ENAMEX> , has a reputation as a savvy financial manager , and will be charged largely with repairing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi</ENAMEX> 's poor financial state .
Asked about the speculation that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis - Dreyfus</ENAMEX> has been hired to pave the way for a buy - out by the brothers , the executive replied , `` That is n't the reason <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dreyfus</ENAMEX> has been brought in .
He was brought in to turn around the company . ''
Separately , several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi</ENAMEX> agency clients said they believe the company 's management shakeup will have little affect on them .
`` It has n't had any impact on us , nor do we expect it to , '' said a spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Miller Brewing Co.</ENAMEX> , a major client of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Backer Spielvogel</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lampe</ENAMEX> , director of advertising at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi -AMP- Saatchi Advertising</ENAMEX> client , said : `` We have no problem with the announcement , because we do n't know what change it 's going to bring about .
We are n't going to change agencies because of a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> . ''
Executives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Backer Spielvogel</ENAMEX> client <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Avis Inc.</ENAMEX> , as well as at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saatchi</ENAMEX> client <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Philips Lighting Co.</ENAMEX> , also said they saw no effect .
Executives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential - Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Backer Spielvogel</ENAMEX> client that is reviewing its account , declined comment .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielvogel</ENAMEX> had said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential - Bache</ENAMEX> was prepared to finance either a management buy - out and restructuring , or a buy - out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Backer Spielvogel</ENAMEX> alone , led by him .
