The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northeast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> regions were unchanged .
A small decline in total construction for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the entire year</ENAMEX> is possible if contracting for housing does n't increase in response to this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> 's lower mortgage rates , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George A. Christie</ENAMEX> , vice president and chief economist of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dodge</ENAMEX> , the forecasting division of publisher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McGraw - Hill Inc</ENAMEX> .

The index uses a base of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> .
Newly contracted residential work edged up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> to an annualized <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 121.2 billion</ENAMEX> , largely because multifamily building rebounded from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a very weak August</ENAMEX> .
`` At <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the third quarter</ENAMEX> , there was still no evidence of renewed home building in response to the midyear decline of mortgage rates , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christie</ENAMEX> said .
Housing has been weak <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</ENAMEX> and especially so in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five months</ENAMEX> .
Contracting for non-residential buildings rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> to an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annualized</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100.8 billion</ENAMEX> .
Commercial and industrial construction rose sharply , partly because of three large projects , each expected to cost more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</ENAMEX> .
Institutional building , such as hospitals and schools , eased in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> following a surge in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> .
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third quarter</ENAMEX> was the best so far <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> for non-residential building , weakness <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early in the year</ENAMEX> held the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nine - month</ENAMEX> total to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 69.6 billion</ENAMEX> , up just <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> .

The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 30</ENAMEX> end of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the federal fiscal year</ENAMEX> may have prodded contractors to get any behind - schedule road and bridge construction under way `` before the clock ran out , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christie</ENAMEX> said , referring to threatened <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> across - the - board budget cuts .
a - <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monthly</ENAMEX> construction contract values are reported on an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annualized</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonally</ENAMEX> adjusted basis .
