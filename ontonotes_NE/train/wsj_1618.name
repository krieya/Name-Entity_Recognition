They did n't play the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> game of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the World Series</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> as scheduled , and they did n't play it on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> either .
But you knew that , did n't you ?
They are supposed to play the game <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next Tuesday</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Candlestick Park</ENAMEX> here .
The theory is that the stadium , damaged by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> 's earthquake , will be repaired by then , and that people will be able to get there .
Like just about everything else , that remains to be seen .
Aftershocks could intervene .
But , at least , the law of averages should have swung to the favorable side .
It may seem trivial to worry about <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the World Series</ENAMEX> amid the destruction to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Bay Area</ENAMEX> wrought by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> 's quake , but the name of this column is `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">On Sports</ENAMEX> , '' so I feel obliged to do so .
You might be interested to know that baseball , not survival , appeared to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> thought of most of the crowd of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60,000 - odd</ENAMEX> that had gathered at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Candlestick</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">5:04 p.m.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a half - hour</ENAMEX> before game time , when the quake struck .
As soon as the tremor passed , many people spontaneously arose and cheered , as though it had been a novel kind of pre-game show .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> fan , seated several rows in front of the open , upper - deck auxiliary press section where I was stationed , faced the assembled newsies and laughingly shouted , `` We arranged that just for you guys ! ''
I thought and , I 'm sure , others did : `` You should n't have bothered . ''
I 'd slept through my only previous brush with natural disaster , a tornado <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">15 or so summers ago</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Traverse City</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , so I was unprepared for one reaction to such things : the urge to talk about them .
Perhaps primed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> diet of radio and TV reporters thrusting microphones into people 's faces and asking how they `` feel '' about <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> calamity or another , fellow reporters and civilians who spied my press credential were eager to chat .
`` It felt like I was on a station platform and a train went by , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> man , describing my own reaction .
A women said she saw the park 's light standards sway .
A man said he saw the upper rim undulate .
I saw neither .
Dictates of good sense to the contrary not withstanding , the general inclination was to believe that the disturbance would be brief and that ball would be played .
`` I was near the top of the stadium , and saw a steel girder bow <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six feet</ENAMEX> from where I sat , but I stayed put for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10 or 15 minutes</ENAMEX> , '' confessed a friend .
`` I guess I thought , ` This is <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the World Series</ENAMEX> and I 'm not gon na wimp out ! ' ''
Here in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Global Village</ENAMEX> , though , folks do not stay uninformed for long .
Electrical power was out in still - daylighted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Candlestick Park</ENAMEX> , but battery - operated radios and television sets were plentiful .
Within <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</ENAMEX> , the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear .
Its Richter Scale measurement was reported as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</ENAMEX> , then <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.9</ENAMEX> , then <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</ENAMEX> .
A section of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> had collapsed , as had a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Interstate Highway 880</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> .
People had died .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">5:40 p.m.</ENAMEX> , scheduled game time having passed , some fans chanted `` Let 's Play Ball . ''
No longer innocent , they qualified as fools .
The stadium was ordered evacuated soon afterward ; the announcement , made over police bullhorns , cited the power outage , but it later was revealed that there also had been damage of the sort reported by my friend .
Outside , I spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> young men lugging blocks of concrete .
`` Pieces of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Candlestick</ENAMEX> , '' they said .
The crowd remained good natured , even bemused .
TV reporters interviewed fans in the parking lots while , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few feet</ENAMEX> away , others watched the interviews on their portable TVs .
The only frenzy I saw was commercial : Booths selling <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Series</ENAMEX> commemorative stamps and dated postmarks were besieged by fledgling speculators who saw future profit in the items .
The traffic jam out of the park was monumental .
It took me <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a half - hour</ENAMEX> to move <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 feet</ENAMEX> from my parking spot in an outer lot to an aisle , and <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">an additional hour</ENAMEX> to reach an inner roadway a half - block away .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six - mile</ENAMEX> trip to my airport hotel that had taken <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</ENAMEX> earlier in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> took <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">more than three hours</ENAMEX> .
At my hotel , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westin</ENAMEX> , power was out , some interior plaster had broken loose and there had been water damage , but little else .
With Garpian randomness , a hotel across the street , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Amfac</ENAMEX> , had been hit harder : A large sheet of its concrete facade and several window balconies were torn away .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westin</ENAMEX> staff had , kindly , set out lighted candles in the ballroom , prepared a cold - cuts buffet and passed around pillows and blankets .
I fell asleep on the lobby floor , next to a man wearing a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cubs</ENAMEX> jacket .
I expected him to say , `` I told you so , '' but he already was snoring .
The journalistic consensus was that the earthquake made <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the World Series</ENAMEX> seem unimportant .
My response was that sports rarely are important , only diverting , and the quake merely highlighted that fact .
Should the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Series</ENAMEX> be played at all ?
Sure .
The quake and baseball were n't related , unlike the massacre of athletes that attended the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX> .
That heavily politicized event learned nothing from the horrifying experience , and seems doomed to repeat it .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> ironies intrude .
This has been widely dubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the BART Series</ENAMEX> , after the local subway line , and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Bay Bridge Series</ENAMEX> .
Flags fly at half - staff for the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bart Giamatti</ENAMEX> , the late baseball commissioner , and now <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> lies in ruins .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Series</ENAMEX> that was shaping up as the dullest since the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - sided <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> - over - San Diego go of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> has become memorable in the least fortunate way .
Still , its edge is lost .
It now will be played mostly for the record , and should be wrapped up as quickly as possible , without <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">`` off '' days</ENAMEX> .
And I will never again complain about a rainout .
