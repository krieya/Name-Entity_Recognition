Concerning your <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 19</ENAMEX> article `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wall Street Firms Link Analysts ' Pay to Performance</ENAMEX> , '' I 'm delighted that Wall Street is finally tuning in to the hard , cold facts of the real working world .
If the firms are serious , however , why limit the practice to the poor , maligned analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best ?
Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force , and pay brokers a base salary with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</ENAMEX> ?
That should stop a lot of account - churning , and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense .
Now , would n't that be a novelty .
