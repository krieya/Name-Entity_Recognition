A reporter asked : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress</ENAMEX> had passed a resolution regarding " the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> - tiered administrative system of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> will operate until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 30th , 1997</ENAMEX> , and then cease . " ;
Then , what will the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> - level <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> restructured administrative system be like ?
And when does the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> side plan to set about preparing to construct this system ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guofang Shen</ENAMEX> said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HK</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> - level administrative system , namely the last <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HK</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> legislative council , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> municipal departments , and the district parliament will only exist till <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 30th , 1997</ENAMEX> .
This is the inevitable outcome of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> terminating its rule over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> at the designated time .
He said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> government has repeatedly stated that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> legislative assembly and regional organizations will be formed according to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Basic Law</ENAMEX> and relevant resolutions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National People 's Congress</ENAMEX> .
Currently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Preparatory Work Committee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Preparatory Committee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region</ENAMEX> is studying relevant specific issues on forming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> legislative assembly , and will submit suggestions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Preparatory Committee</ENAMEX> that will be established in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> .
A reporter asked : on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August 23rd</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> president signed the " <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">financial year overseas activities fund appropriation act</ENAMEX> " in which it is stipulated that any donation made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> population fund must not be used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
What is your opinion of this ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guofang Shen</ENAMEX> said that this bill is a bill carrying political discrimination and extremely unfriendly to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
It is an insult to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's family planning policy , has seriously violated the mission and principles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> charter , and sets a very bad precedent for the provision of aid to multi-lateral organizations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> .
He pointed out that " we resolutely oppose any country providing donations with attached conditions to the population fund .
We do not hope to see the work of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> population fund receiving interference or even being diverted from its principles and mission due to pressure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">US</ENAMEX> . "
