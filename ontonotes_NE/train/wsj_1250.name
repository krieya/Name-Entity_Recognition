Big gains for the ultra-right <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> party in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baden - Wuerttemburg</ENAMEX> state municipal elections <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> showed eroding support for Chancellor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX> in a traditional bastion for his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christian Democratic Union</ENAMEX> .
With ballots from most of the state 's major cities in by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> came away with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> of the vote in several of the key districts .
With many rural districts yet to report ballots , election officials estimate support for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christian Democrats</ENAMEX> fell an average <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> percentage points statewide .
The left - of - center <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Social Democrats</ENAMEX> and the environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Greens</ENAMEX> party posted mixed results .
Headed by a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Waffen SS</ENAMEX> sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric , the fledgling <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> party has scored surprising gains in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</ENAMEX> elections in the states of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Berlin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hesse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North - Rhine Westphalia</ENAMEX> .
With <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> unemployment remaining high at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two million</ENAMEX> jobless and the lack of affordable housing becoming a primary issue for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year 's</ENAMEX> campaign , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> are seen drawing support for their `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Germans</ENAMEX> First '' stand on social - welfare issues .
Election analysts acknowledge that a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Red</ENAMEX> - Green '' coalition of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Social Democrats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Greens</ENAMEX> could edge out Chancellor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kohl</ENAMEX> 's coalition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1990</ENAMEX> national election if support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> continues to spread .

Under current law , such suspects are immune from prosecution for acts committed while not <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> citizens .
`` If we 're not careful we could become known as a haven for war criminals , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Rooker</ENAMEX> , a member of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parliament</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of several <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> politicians attending a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> conference with government investigators from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> .

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parliament</ENAMEX> is expected to discuss <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</ENAMEX> whether to change the law .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> investigations were prompted by a list of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> alleged war criminals living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> sent to Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1986</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Simon Wiesenthal Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .

Olivetti -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> subsidiary called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OCN - PPL</ENAMEX> that makes numerically controlled machine tools .
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> 's investigation of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Olivetti</ENAMEX> had violated Western export - control rules had previously been made known , this marked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time the unit and product were named .
