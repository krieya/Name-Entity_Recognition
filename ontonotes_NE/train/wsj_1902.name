<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Great American Bank</ENAMEX> said its board approved the formation of a holding company enabling the savings bank to pursue nontraditional banking activities under a new federal law .
The proposed holding company 's primary purpose would be to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Great American</ENAMEX> to continue engaging in real estate development activities , it said .
Those activities generated <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26.1 million</ENAMEX> in operating profit <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
But according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Great American</ENAMEX> , such profits do n't count toward meeting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> savings bank 's new capitalization requirements under <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> federal law .
The new real estate unit would have a separate capital structure to comply with the law .
The proposed holding company would also consolidate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Great American Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ariz.</ENAMEX> , savings bank into a single , federally chartered institution in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> .
The consolidation is expected to save <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</ENAMEX> a year in administrative costs , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Great American</ENAMEX> spokesman said .
