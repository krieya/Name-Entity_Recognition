<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">FALL</ENAMEX> BALLOT ISSUES set a record for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">off - year</ENAMEX> elections .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Odd - year</ENAMEX> elections attract relatively few ballot issues .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1989 fall</ENAMEX> total of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</ENAMEX> , while well below <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> activity , shows `` a steady ratcheting up in citizen referenda and initiatives , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick McGuigan</ENAMEX> , editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Family , Law and Democracy Report</ENAMEX> .
He says the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> citizen - sparked issues on state ballots <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</ENAMEX> represent the most in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">any odd - year this decade</ENAMEX> .
Ballot questions range from a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> initiative on banning <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cruise</ENAMEX> missiles to a referendum on increasing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Dakota</ENAMEX> income tax .
Ballot watchers say attention already is focused on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> elections .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> petition drives for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year 's</ENAMEX> election are `` essentially finished , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Schmidt</ENAMEX> , author of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Citizen Lawmakers</ENAMEX> . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGuigan</ENAMEX> cites <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> completed efforts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> .
Hot ballot topics are expected to be abortion , the environment and insurance reform .
Taking a cue from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , more politicians will launch their campaigns by backing initiatives , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Magleby</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Brigham Young University</ENAMEX> .
PHOTOGRAPH COLLECTING gains new stature as prices rise .
Price records are being set at auctions <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christie 's</ENAMEX> , a folio of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</ENAMEX> prints from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Stieglitz 's</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Equivalents</ENAMEX> '' series sold for $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">396,000</ENAMEX> , a single - lot record .
Other works also have been exceeding price estimates .
In part , prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints .
This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beth Gates - Warren</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> .
`` There is finally some sort of sense in the market , '' she says .
Corporations and museums are among the serious buyers , giving greater market stability , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Persky</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Photograph Collector</ENAMEX> .
`` When I see prints going into the hands of institutions , I know they are n't going to come back on the market . ''
Most in demand : classic photographs by masters such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stieglitz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Man Ray</ENAMEX> .
But much contemporary work is also fetching `` a great deal of money , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles Barth</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Center of Photography</ENAMEX> .
DIALING 900 brings callers a growing number of services .
Currently a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 million</ENAMEX> - a - year business , 900 telephone service is expected to hit <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> and near <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> as uses for the service continue to expand , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Gross</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Donaldson , Lufkin -AMP- Jenrette Inc</ENAMEX> .
The service -- which costs the caller from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 cents</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">25</ENAMEX> a minute -- currently is dominated by celebrity chatter , horoscopes and romance lines .
But more serious applications are in the wings , and that is where the future growth is expected .
`` I 'm starting to see more business transactions , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea West</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Telephone -AMP- Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> , noting growing interest in use of 900 service for stock sales , software tutorials and even service contracts .
Colleges , she says , are eyeing registration through 900 service .
Charities test the waters , but they face legal barriers to electronic fund raising .
`` The thing that will really break this market right open is merchandising , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">West</ENAMEX> says .
Much of the 800 service will `` migrate to 900 , '' predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Lawless</ENAMEX> , general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">US Sprint 's</ENAMEX> 900 product .
