When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert McDuffie</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">14</ENAMEX> , he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX> .
Unfortunately , his mother had tickets for a recital by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Itzhak Perlman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the same night</ENAMEX> , and she was adamant about his attending .
`` I threw such a fit , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> , who had begun violin studies at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of six</ENAMEX> .
`` But once <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perlman</ENAMEX> started playing , I did n't give a damn about basketball ... .
Afterwards , I went home and practiced for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</ENAMEX> . ''
Today , it 's obvious that the brawny , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six - foot , one - inch</ENAMEX> musician made the right choice .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">At 31</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> has a rich , full - bodied tone , an admirable rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule .
He 's currently in the midst of a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> - city <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> tour with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yehudi Menuhin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Warsaw Sinfonia</ENAMEX> , with stops including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charleston</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.C .</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 25</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sarasota</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fla .</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 28</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tampa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fla .</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 29</ENAMEX> -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 31</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Later this season</ENAMEX> he gives a recital at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kennedy Center</ENAMEX> , and appears as soloist with several major orchestras .
Yet Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> 's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries .
During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</ENAMEX> , he was part of a musical `` brat pack '' -- a group of budding virtuosos who studied at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Juilliard School</ENAMEX> with the noted pedagogue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy DeLay</ENAMEX> .
His violin classmates included <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shlomo Mintz</ENAMEX> , a protege of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Stern</ENAMEX> who performed with major orchestras while still a student ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cho - Liang Lin</ENAMEX> , who joined the roster of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ICM Artists Inc.</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 18</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nadja Salerno - Sonnenberg</ENAMEX> , who launched her career by winning the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Naumberg Competition</ENAMEX> .
`` I thought I was over the hill at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">22</ENAMEX> , '' recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> , an outgoing man with pale blue eyes and a light <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Southern</ENAMEX> drawl .
`` But I was n't ready for a career at that time . ''
Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> violin teacher was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henrik Schwarzenberger</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hungarian</ENAMEX> refugee who taught in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macon</ENAMEX> public school system .
`` He taught me how to play like a gypsy , '' jokes the musician .
`` I did n't learn to count until I got to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Juilliard</ENAMEX> . ''
After studies at that conservatory 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pre-College Division</ENAMEX> with an assistant to the legendary instructor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan Galamian</ENAMEX> , he switched at the college level to Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galamian</ENAMEX> 's longtime assistant and , ultimately , his rival .
`` I think I had to prove myself to her , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> .
`` But she was always encouraging .
She only put her foot down twice , '' he continues .
`` In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">my freshman year</ENAMEX> , my roommate was known as a party animal .
She thought I was n't getting my practicing done . ''
As the violinist tells it , his grandmotherly looking teacher `` put her hands on her hips , stomped her foot and said , ` You 've just got to get the -LCB- expletive deleted -RCB- out of there . ' ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> incident took place after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself .
Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital .
`` We listened to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chausson</ENAMEX> ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Poeme</ENAMEX> , ' '' he recalls , `` and she said , ` You hear the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> note , that B - flat ?
That 's the only note that 's truly in tune ... ' . ''
`` That 's the most important experience I 've had with any teacher , '' he says , `` because she taught me how to listen .
Now , when I play with orchestras , the musicians often compliment me on my intonation . ''
It was also at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Juilliard</ENAMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> discovered his predilection for conservative , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20th - century</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> composers such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Diamond</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Barber</ENAMEX> .
After winning a school competition with a performance of the latter 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Violin Concerto</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> was invited to play the work for the composer , who was dying of cancer .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barber</ENAMEX> was seated by the fireplace looking very pale , '' recalls the violinist , who performed the work with a piano accompanist at the composer 's apartment .
`` He did n't say much , but what he said was important because it 's not in the score .
There 's a beautiful , Coplandesque motif -- he 'd kill me if he heard me say that -- throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> movement ...
The only time the violin has it is right at the end .
It 's written ` marcato ' in the score , and I played it that way , kind of gigue - like .
And he yelled out ` dolce ! dolce ! ' -LCB- ` sweet ! sweet ! ' -RCB- . ''
`` So we did it over , '' he adds .
`` I played very transparently , with the tip of the bow .
If a conductor is sensitive enough to bring down the orchestra -LCB- volume -RCB- at that point , it makes the piece magical .
I do n't know why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barber</ENAMEX> never told anybody else .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Stern 's</ENAMEX> recording it 's very biting . ''
Since leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Juilliard</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> has made some smart moves and some controversial ones .
His guest appearance on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> soap opera `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Another World</ENAMEX> , '' scandalized musical elitists .
By contrast , he 's won kudos for his espousal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Schuman 's</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Violin Concerto</ENAMEX> , '' which he recently recorded for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Angel / EMI</ENAMEX> along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Bernstein 's</ENAMEX> engaging `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Serenade for Violin Solo , Strings and Percussion</ENAMEX> . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> 's sweet tone , heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works .
Aided by the fluid playing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the St. Louis Symphony</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Slatkin 's</ENAMEX> direction , this `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Serenade</ENAMEX> '' really swings .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schuman</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Violin Concerto</ENAMEX> , '' which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment , meanders until the propulsive `` Agitato , fervente . ''
But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist , brass and timpani .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Avery Fisher Hall</ENAMEX> here , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> was heard recently with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menuhin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Warsaw Sinfonia</ENAMEX> in more conventional fare -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruch</ENAMEX> 's overwrought `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Violin Concerto in G Minor</ENAMEX> . ''
His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</ENAMEX> - member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sinfonia</ENAMEX> played adroitly with a big , lush sound that belied its size .
Whatever he plays , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> finds satisfaction in the music itself -- `` something greater out there than me , '' as he puts it during an interview at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> apartment he shares with wife , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Camille</ENAMEX> , a literary publicist .
`` A normal person did not write the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beethoven</ENAMEX> ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Violin Concerto</ENAMEX> , ' '' he declares .
`` Even when I hear it played badly , I 'm still humbled by the piece .
If I could ever feel I 've contributed to it in some way , then all the hard work has been worth it . ''
