When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> upheld <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> 's abortion restrictions <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last July</ENAMEX> , the justices almost certainly did n't have drunk driving , trespassing and false imprisonment on their minds .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</ENAMEX> - 4 ruling may have had as much immediate impact on those activities -- especially trespassing -- as on abortion rights .
The decision , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Reproductive Health Services</ENAMEX> , illustrates how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> rulings often have a ripple effect , spreading into areas of law and policy that were n't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> case , unforeseen consequences may have arisen because the high court reinstated the preamble of the state 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> abortion law .
The preamble says that human life begins at conception and that unborn children have rights protected by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Constitution</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , a federal appeals court in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX> said the preamble was unconstitutional , citing an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> ruling that states ca n't justify stricter abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> concluded that it was premature to rule on the constitutionality of the preamble because the definition of human life had n't yet been used to restrict abortion services .
The high court majority said it was up to the state courts for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">now</ENAMEX> to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws .
Already , local <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> judges have relied on the restored preamble in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Reproductive Health Services</ENAMEX> , an abortion clinic in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX> .
The protesters said their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children .
Under a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> law , persons accused of some crimes , including trespassing , may offer a defense that their actions were justified `` as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury . ''
Relying on the preamble 's statement that a fetus is an unborn child , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">St. Louis County Circuit Court</ENAMEX> judges in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives .
In another case , a protester , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann O'Brien</ENAMEX> , was convicted of trespass before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> ruling .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> , when her appeal was argued before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Missouri Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> , her lawyer also relied on the preamble .
`` The effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> opinion is that it left room for grass to grow in the cracks of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roe</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX> , and I think this is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the cracks , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Belz</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX> lawyer who represented Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Brien</ENAMEX> and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX> protesters .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roe</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</ENAMEX> decision that recognized a woman 's right to abortion .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Mandina</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kansas City Lawyers for Life</ENAMEX> , says that if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass , `` This will shut down abortion in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> .
There 's no risk to the protesters , and you ca n't keep an abortion clinic open if there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</ENAMEX> people standing outside <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</ENAMEX> . ''
That would be an ironic result of a case in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> expressly stopped short of overruling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roe</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> other cases , the possible consequences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> ruling appear even more unintended .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> , the lawyer for a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 - year - old</ENAMEX> resident of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mo.</ENAMEX> , who was charged with drunk driving , argued that his client should be treated as a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">21 - year - old</ENAMEX> adult because his actual age should be calculated from conception , not from birth .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> , those caught drinking and driving <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages of 16 and 21</ENAMEX> may have their licenses revoked for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</ENAMEX> , while those <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">21</ENAMEX> or older suffer only a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - day</ENAMEX> suspension .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boone County</ENAMEX> judge rejected the motion , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Dodson</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jefferson City</ENAMEX> lawyer , says he has appealed .
And in a case filed in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , a lawyer is arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> authorities are wrongfully imprisoning the fetus of a pregnant woman who is in jail for theft and forgery .
