Proposals for government - operated `` national service , '' like influenza , flare up from time to time , depress the resistance of the body politic , run their course , and seem to disappear , only to mutate and afflict public life anew .
The disease metaphor comes to mind , of course , not as an aspersion on the advocates of national service .
Rather , it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought had been eliminated in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1970s</ENAMEX> , along with smallpox .
It is back with us again , in the form of legislation to pay volunteers under a `` National and Community Service Act , '' a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</ENAMEX> .
Why does the national - service virus keep coming back ?
Perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel .
If only we could get <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach self - discipline again and revive the spirit of giving .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A quarter of a century ago</ENAMEX> national service was promoted as a way of curing the manifest inequities of the draft -- by , of all things , expanding the draft .
Those of us who resisted the idea then suspect <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long - term aim of many national - service backers , despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion .
Choice of the volunteer military in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</ENAMEX> seemed to doom national service as much as the draft .
But the virus was kept alive in sociology departments until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years ago</ENAMEX> , when it again was let loose .
This time it attempted to invade <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> connected problems , the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans .
Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants , the advocates reasoned , but require some form of service from each recipient ?
Military service , moreover , could be a national - service option .
Thus , undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove contagious , infecting patriotic conservatives , pay - as - you - go moderates , and idealistic liberals .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Democratic Leadership Council</ENAMEX> , a centrist group sponsoring the plan , surely thought it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents .
A provision allowing grants to be applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> - home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DLC</ENAMEX> plan envisaged `` volunteers '' planting trees , emptying bedpans , tutoring children , and assisting librarians for $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">100</ENAMEX> a week , tax free , plus medical care .
With a tax - free $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000</ENAMEX> voucher payment at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of each year</ENAMEX> , the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">17,500</ENAMEX> a year .
Mind you , most of `` the volunteers '' would be unskilled <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">17 - to 18 - year - olds</ENAMEX> , some not even high school graduates , and many saving money by living at home .
They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families .
As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system , so the national - service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of `` give in order to get . ''
Opposition to national service from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> , which wants to protect its own recruitment process , also led to the military - service option being dropped .
Clearly , a new rationale for national service had to be cooked up .
What better place to turn than Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kennedy</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Labor Committee</ENAMEX> , that great stove of government expansionism , where many a stagnant pot of porridge is kept on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine ?
In this case , the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> kettle : a demonstration project for educational aid -LRB- particularly satisfying to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DLC</ENAMEX> and Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Nunn</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation -LRB- a la Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Dodd</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a competitive grants program to states to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects -LRB- a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> specialty -RRB- , a community service work - study program for students -LRB- pleasing to the palate of Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Bumpers</ENAMEX> , among others -RRB- , plus engorgement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VISTA</ENAMEX> volunteer program and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Retired Senior Volunteer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Foster Grandparent</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senior Companion</ENAMEX> programs .
Before the menu is printed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> may add more ingredients , also changing the initial price , now posted at some <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 330 million</ENAMEX> .
It is widely known that `` too many cooks spoil the broth , '' but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the cooks , especially if they are senators .
The `` omnibus '' bill coming out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> may be unwholesome glop , but the assorted chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the dish very hard .
The aroma of patronage is in the air .
Is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance ?
On the contrary , it is as robust as ever .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Gallup Poll</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> adults contribute an average of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</ENAMEX> a week of service , while financial contributions to charity in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</ENAMEX> have risen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> -LRB- adjusted for inflation -RRB- .
Even if government does see various `` unmet needs , '' national service is not the way to meet them .
If we want to support students , we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more scholarships based on something called `` scholarship , '' rather than on the government 's idea of `` service . ''
Or we might provide a tax credit for working students .
What we do not need to do is start a war , and then try to justify it by creating <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">a GI Bill</ENAMEX> .
To the extent we lack manpower to staff menial jobs in hospitals , for example , we should raise pay , pursue labor - saving technology , or allow more legal immigration , rather than overpay high school graduates as short - term workers and cause resentment among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs .
Will national service , in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ?
Not necessarily .
Polls show wide , generalized support for some vague concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing .
Nonetheless , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> are organizing a roll of supporting `` associations , '' `` societies '' and `` councils , '' some of which may hope to receive the paid `` volunteers . ''
So far , the president seems ill - disposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his own free - standing proposal to endow a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Points of Light</ENAMEX> '' foundation with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 million</ENAMEX> to inform citizens of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism .
However , even this admirable plan could become objectionable if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> gives in to congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in `` brokering '' federal funds for volunteer projects .
There 's no need for such concessions .
The omnibus can be defeated , the virus controlled , and real service protected .
National service , the utopian idea , still wo n't go away then , of course , but <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the millions</ENAMEX> of knee - socked youth performing works of `` civic content '' will be mobilized only in the imagination of their progenitors .
