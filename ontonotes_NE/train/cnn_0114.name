<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> left his residence at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Naval Observatory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> to attend to his duties as Vice President at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the White House</ENAMEX> .
In an interview taped <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today</ENAMEX> '' show , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> said he thought his chance of winning the legal battle for the presidency was 50 / <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> .
He was asked if he thought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> was trying to `` steal '' the election .
I have -- I have never used that word , that phrase , and , in fact , I have publicly -- well , in one public statement , urged my supporters never to use that phrase .
I think that both Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and I should recognize an obligation during this time when the votes are still being -- are still to be counted , to try to restrain the passions of our partisan supporters .
