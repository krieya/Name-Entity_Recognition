Elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> , officials from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> and marine anti-terrorist specialists have arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> to investigate <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's explosion that crippled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">US Navy</ENAMEX> destroyer , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</ENAMEX> sailors are confirmed dead and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</ENAMEX> of the missing are now presumed dead .
The wounded have been evacuated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and to neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Djibouti</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Djibouti</ENAMEX> is where until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> conducted its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Red Sea</ENAMEX> refueling operations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Moore</ENAMEX> , a former government intelligence analyst says it was a mistake for those operations to move to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> .
I tend to fault the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> policy that brought the refueling activity from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Djibouti</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> , given the abundance of threat indicators in the country , that being <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> .
It has been known for some time that various groups , either <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">North African</ENAMEX> groups , some of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Laden 's</ENAMEX> men actively reside in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> , so again , I really question the wisdom of that policy .
You say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> was using <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Djibouti</ENAMEX> for more or less the same purposes that , for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last year or so</ENAMEX> , they have been using <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> , that they knew that there was a much more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="5">anti-American</ENAMEX> atmosphere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> .
Why then did they go there ?
Did they have some other overriding concerns ?
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> has been attempting to support movements for democratization in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> and there has been some attempts to buttress the government of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali Abdullah Saleh</ENAMEX> and I believe that this is directly tied into that .
There were elections held , I believe , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year or so ago</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> were involved as far as assessing and evaluating the validity of the elections , and I think this grew out of that policy of supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> government , but again the problem that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> government faces is they do n't actively control the countryside .
That is split between various tribal groups and there is also , as I mentioned , extremists that look at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> as , say , heaven .
They have been there for well on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</ENAMEX> , various groups at different times , of course .
In terms of talking about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> and giving us a feeling for what is interesting about this country , another thing that is interesting about it would seem to be that this is a country that had pretty much sided , as I understand it , with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Gulf War</ENAMEX> .
Is that true and if so why is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> involved with it now ?
That is true .
The government of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> , led by the current President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali Abdullah Saleh</ENAMEX> , did exhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="4">pro-Iraqi</ENAMEX> sentiment during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Gulf War</ENAMEX> .
As far as the reasoning behind why the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> is trying to rebuild its ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> , again the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> policy is to try to build a bridge with as many countries as possible within a region , particularly the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> world .
We hope the countries can become potential friends , if not allies , in the region .
So there is a bit of , ok , yes we do n't agree with what you did in the past , but let 's try to put that behind us and look forward .
And what have the developments there led you to believe about the wisdom of that policy ?
The wisdom of trying to establish ties with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> government , I can certainly see the logic behind that .
Again my specific question comes in to why they moved the refueling activity from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Djibouti</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> , given the level of threat in the country .
It is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing to build relationships , it is another thing to put actually your men and women on the front line , when they did n't have to be there .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Moore</ENAMEX> is a research analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis</ENAMEX> .
He joined us in our studios here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
