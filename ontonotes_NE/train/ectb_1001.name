After the Handover : <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwan - Macau</ENAMEX> Relations in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the New Millennium</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one million</ENAMEX> travelers from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> passed through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Macau Airport</ENAMEX> , heading for mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> or visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> itself , and accounting for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</ENAMEX> of passengers using the airport .
Around <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's civil servants have studied in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</ENAMEX> some <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</ENAMEX> people travel from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> for business or work , along with more than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</ENAMEX> students .
But against the backdrop of continued proclamations from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PRC</ENAMEX> about how " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's ' <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> country <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> systems ' arrangement sets an example for solving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> problem , " these figures , along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwan - Macau</ENAMEX> exchanges that they represent , have been willfully neglected by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's mainstream media .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> : so near and yet so far .
What are the connections that bind these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> places , and what are the opportunities for new developments in the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</ENAMEX> handover ?
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 19 , 1999</ENAMEX> , the eve of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's transfer of sovereignty , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the China Times</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> published a survey on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> public 's views about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's return to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> control .
According to the survey , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31 %</ENAMEX> of people in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> were n't even aware that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> was about to be handed back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53 %</ENAMEX> answered that they did n't know whether the handover would be beneficial or harmful for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's development .
But when asked whether the " <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> country <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> systems " formula , as used for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> , was acceptable for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59 %</ENAMEX> responded " No , " while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 %</ENAMEX> said that they did n't know .
As these results clearly indicate , the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> still know little about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> , in spite of existing exchanges , and more than half of them flatly reject <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> 's " one country two systems " formula - so readily taken up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> - as a solution to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> question .
Conveniently connected
It takes just <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour and a half</ENAMEX> to fly from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Macau University</ENAMEX> professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wong Hon Keong</ENAMEX> says , " You can get there and back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</ENAMEX> .
You catch the first flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> , stop at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westin</ENAMEX> for a coffee and to talk business , head to one of the outlying islands in the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</ENAMEX> for a round of golf , take a stroll downtown , and return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</ENAMEX> . "
But in spite of the convenience for travelers , ties between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> places have been practically invisible for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several decades</ENAMEX> .
What path will the relationship follow now that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> has returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> ?
As you pass through the offices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Macau government 's</ENAMEX> directorate of administration you notice the relative youth of the staff , most of whom seem to be in their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">thirties</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa Tam</ENAMEX> , who heads the recruitment and selection division of the directorate 's human resources department , introduces many of her colleagues with the remark that he or she " studied in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> too . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tam</ENAMEX> herself graduated from the department of educational psychology at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Taiwan Normal University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> , and joined <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's department of education in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , before eventually moving to the directorate of administration and rising to the post of division chief in just <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">11 years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tam</ENAMEX> is just one of the many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> civil servants who have studied for degrees in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Macau government 's</ENAMEX> directorate for administration says that around <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> civil servants have academic qualifications from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , but according to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's representative office in the territory , the figure is closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</ENAMEX> .
This may not represent a very large share of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,000</ENAMEX> civil servants , but given that many of those who graduated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> hold senior ranks , it adds something of a " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> flavor " to the government of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> SAR <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">-LRB- Special Administrative Region -RRB-</ENAMEX> .
In contrast , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> alumni are noticeable by their absence from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the SAR government</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
At present , the most senior government official to have studied in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ou Wenlong</ENAMEX> , who graduated in mechanical engineering at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Taiwan University</ENAMEX> -LRB- NTU -RRB- .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ou</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's secretary for transportation and public works , and has been appointed by Chief Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Ho</ENAMEX> as one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the SAR government 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> administration secretaries .
Amid all the hype surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's incorporation under the " <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> country <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> systems " formula , the sensitive issue of the " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> connection " within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Macau government</ENAMEX> is little discussed .
As the clearest example of this connection , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ou Wenlong</ENAMEX> is one official that many journalists from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> have tried to get an interview with , but their requests have all been turned down on the grounds that the secretary is " too busy . "
He did nevertheless find time to do an interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Phoenix TV</ENAMEX> , during which he discoursed freely on the subject of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's development .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sinorama</ENAMEX> applied , in line with official procedure , for a press pass to the handover ceremony , but the application was eventually rejected as " unapproved by the security department . "
On the eve of the handover , the signboard of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Taipei Trade and Tourism Office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> was quietly taken down , after the office had been privately warned to remove the sign before the transfer of sovereignty .
Office director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Li</ENAMEX> was subsequently reprimanded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Mainland Affairs Council</ENAMEX> for his handling of the affair .
None of the above was problems at the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> handover in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> , which goes to show how cautious the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau SAR</ENAMEX> government is regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
When senior <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> officials are asked about having studied in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , they are always quick to add mention of other academic qualifications obtained in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> , or mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
" It 's called sanitizing your record ! " quips <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tan Zhiqiang</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> bureau chief for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the China Times</ENAMEX> , who was born and raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> and wrote his doctoral dissertation on " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Question of Macau 's Sovereignty</ENAMEX> . "
The more senior a government official is , the more defensive he is likely to be on the subject of his studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
" It does n't matter where you studied and where you graduated , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Mingying</ENAMEX> , a senior official in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> government 's news department .
Competence and professionalism are what the government requires from its personnel .
Another graduate of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> institution declares bluntly that he only spent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> getting his degree , and the place had virtually no effect on him at all .
Nevertheless , there has been a steady stream of students from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> ever since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</ENAMEX> .
According to statistics from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around 6,000</ENAMEX> have come in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past ten years</ENAMEX> , and Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wong Hon Keong</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Macau University 's Macau Research Center</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> of middle school graduates in the territory have sat the overseas enrolment test for college in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Around 600</ENAMEX> candidates passed the test <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , and there are on average <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,600 - 2,000</ENAMEX> students from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> at university in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> at any one time .
" Semi-liberated area "
Perhaps the reason for the apparent lack of attachment to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> among the many returned <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> alumni can be traced to historical factors .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> was convulsed by rioting in which several people were shot and killed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Portuguese</ENAMEX> security forces .
The enclave 's left - wing groups , which were closely allied with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> , took advantage of the situation to get <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> organizations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> shut down and their people expelled .
Ever since , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> has been regarded in certain circles in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> as a " semi-liberated area . "
But if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's pro-Beijing forces are that strong , how come so many students come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> to get their degrees ?
" There are historical reasons for this too , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ou Jinrong</ENAMEX> , former president of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taiwan Alumni Association</ENAMEX> and a member both of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Macau SAR 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">first Selection Committee</ENAMEX> , and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Preparatory Committee</ENAMEX> .
Prior to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980s</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> lacked its own colleges , and students had to go overseas for higher education .
Also , colleges on the mainland did n't start enrolling overseas students until the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1980s</ENAMEX> , while it was difficult to gain admission to university in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
Under these circumstances , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> universities , which actively recruited abroad , were a natural choice for many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Macau</ENAMEX> students .
" In terms of the return you get on your investment , taking your degree in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> is well worth it , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Yun</ENAMEX> , acting head of the sanitation and environment division of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's urban administration office , who graduated in civil engineering from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Cheng Kung University</ENAMEX> -LRB- NCKU -RRB- in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tainan</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's universities have good teachers and decent facilities , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang</ENAMEX> , and students from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> can learn much in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> that will benefit them in their careers .
Unlike the colonial administration in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the government of Macau</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Portuguese</ENAMEX> recognized academic credentials issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> institutions .
It was only in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1980s</ENAMEX> , once the timetable for the handover of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> had been agreed , that the government began to localize the civil service in preparation for the transition to " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> people running Macau . "
A number of graduates who had returned from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> to work in the private sector then shifted to government jobs , and have come to form an influential part of the administration .
" Little prawns grow into big lobsters if there are no fish in the sea , " smiles <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leong Kam Chun</ENAMEX> , who graduated in business administration from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</ENAMEX> .
Compared with the many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Macau</ENAMEX> students who went to the mainland to study from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1980s</ENAMEX> onwards , those who graduated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> returned and joined the civil service earlier , and seem to have made faster progress in their careers .
" There 's no denying that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> universities have given us a good education , " smiles <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leong Hong Sai</ENAMEX> , secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taiwan Universities Alumni Association</ENAMEX> .
In addition to the government officials who studied in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , many returned graduates have become influential in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> through their success in the private sector .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leong Kam Chun</ENAMEX> , for instance , one of the territory 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> group of professional accountants , has also served on the legislative council and is a member of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Macau SAR Selection Committee</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leong Man Io</ENAMEX> , current president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Taiwan Universities Alumni Association</ENAMEX> , who graduated in civil engineering from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NCKU</ENAMEX> , is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's most prominent civil engineers .
He has supervised several major projects such as landscaping <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maritime Museum</ENAMEX> and setting up venues for the handover events .
Unlike neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> , there was no public backlash in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> on the occasion of the handover , and no exodus of emigrants .
Everything seemed smooth and orderly .
But the people 's primary concern was whether or not the incoming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SAR</ENAMEX> administration would be capable of tackling difficult problems left behind by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Portuguese</ENAMEX> , particularly economic recession and declining public order .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> " localizations " - of civil administration , the law , and official language - have become a focus of public discussion .
Concern has been expressed that responsibility has been passed to local administrators too late , and that they are too young and inexperienced - statistics from the department of civil service reveal that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61 %</ENAMEX> of government officials are <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">40</ENAMEX> or under - to deal effectively with problems facing the newly established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SAR</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leong Kam Chun</ENAMEX> says : " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> began nurturing local administrative talent in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1970s</ENAMEX> , whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> only started doing so <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</ENAMEX> later , in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1980s</ENAMEX> .
" Several problems have already begun to emerge , such as the question of " legal localization . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Mei</ENAMEX> , executive director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Sino - Latino Foundation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> , points out that during their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four centuries</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Portuguese</ENAMEX> never attempted to build up the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX> language ability of the local people .
Few <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> have ever mastered <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX> , and there are not many people who understand both Western law and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> language .
This presents enormous difficulties for the localization into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's mass of colonial era laws .
Due to the chronic dearth of qualified personnel among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's judiciary , much of the work of legal localization depends on experts from the mainland .
But according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Mei</ENAMEX> , " The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">socialist</ENAMEX> law that they are used to on the mainland is out of synch with the capitalist - type law of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> , in terms both of attitude and spirit . "
But legal professionals who have studied in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , where legal concepts are closer to those that hold in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> , can play an important role in this localization process .
Communication bridge
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's perspective , how can these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> alumni benefit the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwan - Macau</ENAMEX> relationship ?
As one of the alumni explains , this is an issue that does n't need to be addressed too directly : with a network of personal connections , the right kind of communication follows naturally .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ou Jinrong</ENAMEX> frankly notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yue Meizhen</ENAMEX> , former vice-director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taiwan Affairs</ENAMEX> section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> branch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Xinhua Agency</ENAMEX> , once encouraged the alumni to " do more to be a bridge between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides . "
And in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mainland Affairs Council</ENAMEX> invited members of the Taiwan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Universities Alumni Association</ENAMEX> on a visit back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , " to hear our views on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwan - Macau</ENAMEX> relations , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leong Hong Sai</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wong Hon Keong</ENAMEX> , deputy director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Macau Research Center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Macau University</ENAMEX> , says that the presence of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> alumni in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> " makes it easier for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> to get things done , " and he feels that this is an asset for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> in terms of developing relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Li</ENAMEX> , director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> , also testifies to the benefits that the alumni bring for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> : " If they 're not too high up in the government , we generally have no problem contacting them by phone , providing information , and getting together for things like social events . "
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tan Zhiqiang</ENAMEX> , himself a returned alumni , points out while it 's fine having dinner together , if it ever came to it , none of the alumni would want to actively " align " themselves with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , given the pro-Beijing political climate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> .
" Which is closer , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> or the mainland ? " asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tan</ENAMEX> .
Friendly factions
On the other hand , political divisions are not as sharply defined in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> as they are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , and people are not so uptight about who they come into contact with .
After all , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> covers an area of just <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">23 sq. km</ENAMEX> -LRB- roughly equivalent to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Nankang district</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> -RRB- and has a population of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">430,000</ENAMEX> .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leong Kam Chun</ENAMEX> says , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> " still has the feel of a rural society . "
You bump into the same people all the time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> , and if you 're too strict about factions , you only make things difficult for yourself .
" Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> people , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> people do n't like to talk politics , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leong</ENAMEX> .
" They 're more interested in the economy . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leong</ENAMEX> describes himself as belonging to the pragmatic " making - a - living " faction .
Although pro-Beijing elements prevail in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Portuguese</ENAMEX> administration did n't seem too bothered about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PRC</ENAMEX> pressure when it came to the issue of ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , perhaps because their only concern was for people 's livelihood .
Visa - free entry to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> is a case in point .
Explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wong Hon Keong</ENAMEX> : " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> offers visa - free access to residents of over <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</ENAMEX> countries with which it has consular relations , but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> is the only place for which it provides visa - free access without there being diplomatic ties . "
Moreover , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> officials have always had an easier time going in and out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> , compared with the fuss involved in getting to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.K. Chiang</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Council for Economic Planning and Development</ENAMEX> , visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> shortly before the handover , and even figures such as mainland democracy activist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu'er Kaixi</ENAMEX> have been admitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> on their way to the mainland - though the mainland authorities of course refused to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu'er</ENAMEX> to cross into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PRC</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> businesspeople in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> form another group that is usually thought of as only concerned about " making a living . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Chung - yung</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Taiwan General Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> is a typical example .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</ENAMEX> , and ran air - tours by light aircraft until the enclave 's international airport opened , after which he moved into the liquor trade .
When he travels to the mainland he takes his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> Resident 's Permit , but when he comes back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> he uses his ROC passport .
As part of his efforts to attract more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> investors to do business in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> , he helped introduce President Group CEO <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kao Chin - yen</ENAMEX> to the territory , and in order to build better ties with the mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> , he helped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Xinhua News Agency</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> to install satellite TV .
But when he found that his elementary - school - age grandson was speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Cantonese</ENAMEX> all day he quickly sent him back to school in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , fearing that the boy was losing his mother tongue .
A consensus among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> living and working in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> is that " you ca n't use ideology to decide what 's right and wrong . "
Another point they agree on is that not enough was done in the past to develop ties between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> , but that with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's change of status , and the corresponding change in atmosphere , things should be different from now on .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Chung - yung</ENAMEX> points out that rents in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> are about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</ENAMEX> less than rents in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's connections with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Union</ENAMEX> means that it enjoys tax concessions and generous trade quotas .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> businesspeople never notice these benefits .
All they see is gang violence and assume that law and order has broken down , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> .
His own account of the situation is that the gangs are fighting it out over casino profits , but that this does n't affect the lives of ordinary people .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> encourages people not to worry , and hopes that they wo n't hesitate to invest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> .
Economic dwarf , cultural giant
But there are also those who think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Chung - yung 's</ENAMEX> attitude is over-optimistic .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Ming - chih</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> businessman based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dongguan</ENAMEX> , points out that wages in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> are not particularly low and there 's very little spare land , no deepwater harbor and no natural resources , which explains why firms remain more interested in investing on the mainland than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wong Hon Keong</ENAMEX> gives a telling analysis :
" What <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> can offer is a service base , with visa - free access , convenience of travel , and open channels of information .
With <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> for R-AMP-D and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhuhai</ENAMEX> as the manufacturing base , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> can provide a window to foreign trade , through which companies can increase their exports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EU</ENAMEX> . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wong</ENAMEX> 's comments pinpoint the intermediary role that Macau plays between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and the mainland .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leong Kam Chun</ENAMEX> notes : " Because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> is so small and sits rights next to mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , its economy is always vulnerable to external factors . "
As soon as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> financial crisis hit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> economy was similarly affected , and unemployment reached <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</ENAMEX> .
Moreover , the contribution made by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> businesses to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> is even less than the spillover from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> firms investing in neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhuhai</ENAMEX> .
Apart from economics , what other forms of possible interaction can <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> share ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> has been a contact point between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> ever since <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Portuguese</ENAMEX> ships first arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</ENAMEX> .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Mei</ENAMEX> points out , the enclave was opened to the outside world more than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">300 years</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
During much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Ming</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Qing</ENAMEX> dynasties , when maritime trade was officially banned , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> was the shipping hub for the " Silk Road of the Sea , " which extended as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South Asia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> in one direction , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South America</ENAMEX> in the other .
Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mei</ENAMEX> : " This is where the Jesuits established the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> - type university in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Far East</ENAMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> scholars such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hong Xiuquan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin Zexu</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liang Qichao</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kang Youwei</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng Guanying</ENAMEX> spent time here absorbing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> learning . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> emerged unscathed from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">WWII</ENAMEX> , and many of its original <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX> - language documents have been preserved intact , providing an invaluable resource for research into cultural and religious exchanges between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> .
In recent years , these archives have attracted particular attention from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> scholars , notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mei</ENAMEX> , driven by interest in the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> exchanges and the influence of maritime culture on their island
Furthermore , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> also serves as an academic and cultural key to the world of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">the Romance languages</ENAMEX> .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mei</ENAMEX> explains , there are plenty of old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX> texts preserved in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> , and the university has a sizeable contingent of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX> - speaking professors .
Most of the territory 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000 - plus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Macanese</ENAMEX> -LRB- locally born <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Portuguese</ENAMEX> -RRB- have elected to remain after the handover , and there are several cultural groups dedicated to the work of translating <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX> literature and preserving <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX> culture .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> who wish to study <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX> do n't have to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mei</ENAMEX> .
" It 's enough to come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> . "
Though it occupies a tiny spit of land , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Portuguese</ENAMEX> colony is home to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> museums of art and history , more than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
" As economic entities go , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> is tiny , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mei</ENAMEX> , " but as a store of culture it 's huge .
So do n't look down on the place . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Matsu</ENAMEX> bridges the gap
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ngan In Leng</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fujian Association</ENAMEX> , explains that the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> - way ties between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Southern Fujian region</ENAMEX> remain to this day , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> visitors to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> can still see traces of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Fujianese</ENAMEX> culture at locations such as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lin Fong Temple</ENAMEX> and the area around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Barrier Gate</ENAMEX> .
And indeed it was <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Fujianese</ENAMEX> fishermen who <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several centuries ago</ENAMEX> built the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Matsu</ENAMEX> temple here - <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the A - Ma - Gau</ENAMEX> from which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> takes its name .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ung Choi Kun</ENAMEX> , deputy chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fujian General Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> , says that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</ENAMEX> mainlanders have moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two decades</ENAMEX> , almost all of them from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fujian Province</ENAMEX> .
At present , around <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</ENAMEX> people from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</ENAMEX> for work , many of them ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Fujianese</ENAMEX> taking advantage of family connections to the island .
" When you talk about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Matsu</ENAMEX> and about hometown bonds , it 's not hard finding topics that link <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> , " remarks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ngan In Leng</ENAMEX> .
" We have many points in common in the field of academia too , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat - sen</ENAMEX> and the colonial experience , " adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Zhiliang</ENAMEX> , director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Macau Foundation</ENAMEX> .
In the realm of politics , suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wong Hon Keong</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> can also serve as a " catalyst and lubricant for relations across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Taiwan Strait</ENAMEX> . "
The international airport , where flights between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and the mainland make a stopover , allows for " <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - plane " travel between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides .
Also , the continued provision after the handover of visa - free entry for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> , along with the relative ease with which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> officials can visit the SAR , testifies to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's flexibility in these matters .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> will help to boost cross-strait relations , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wong Hon Keong</ENAMEX> .
But as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tan Zhiqiang</ENAMEX> points out , nearly a quarter of the residents of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> have arrived from the mainland during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past ten years</ENAMEX> .
Unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Portuguese</ENAMEX> colonial administration always tried to minimize conflict with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> , promoting compromise and dialogue .
As a result there was little " anti-China " sentiment among the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> at the time of the handover , in contrast to the pro-democracy mood that swept <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> .
" When <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> are confronted with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> 's ' pro-Beijing ' slant , they should try and be more understanding . " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tan</ENAMEX> .
Breaking down fences
In fact , the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> are n't necessarily as ecstatic about the handover as they are made out to be , and after more than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">400 years</ENAMEX> of rule the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Portuguese</ENAMEX> have left behind more than just European - style buildings , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Portuguese</ENAMEX> food , and churches .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Macau University</ENAMEX> set up <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">a " Handover Workshop "</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</ENAMEX> , and it has proved highly popular .
Also , a number of books have been brought out by the government and by private publishers , exploring the enclave 's history and identity .
Indeed , " identity " is precisely what the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> have been looking for .
The presence of mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is what bonds <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> , yet it is also what keeps them apart .
The spectacular handover ceremony , which took place in the global spotlight , is already over and done with .
Strolling through downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> one notices prominent signs advertising popular <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> snack - stops , like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dingtaifeng Dumpling Restaurant</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Quickly Iced Drinks</ENAMEX> .
Business seems to be thriving at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Margaret 's egg - tart bakery</ENAMEX> , whose brand name is known throughout the region and probably defines " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> " for many in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
For businesspeople , there seems to be little evidence of obstacles in the way of better <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwan - Macau</ENAMEX> relations .
The excitement surrounding the handover has died down , and life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> goes on much as before .
The artificial boundaries and obstacles that people set up between each other must ultimately be removed by people themselves .
