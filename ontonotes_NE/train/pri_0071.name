This is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The World</ENAMEX> .
I am <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Mullins</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The United States</ENAMEX> is the heavyweight champion of the world when it comes to the internet .
Now based on past experience , you 'd think the main challenger for the crown would be <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
Well , you would be wrong .
When it comes to the internet , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> could have been a contender .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This week</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , a blue ribbon advisory panel wrapped up proposals aimed at turning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> into an information technology powerhouse by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</ENAMEX> .
We asked The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">World</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucy Craft</ENAMEX> to find out how fast the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> will have to drive to catch up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> on the information superhighway .
By all appearances , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> would seem a natural candidate to be the next internet superpower .
At this recent technology trade show in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTT Docomell</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's biggest cell phone maker touted its latest model .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> callers will be able to see as well as hear each other , thanks to the addition of a tiny video monitor .
The country that gave the world VCRs , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Walkman</ENAMEX> and video games continues to churn out entertainment related devices .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this Christmas season 's</ENAMEX> hottest items is this .
A consumer version of a DJ 's night club turntable , complete with simulated scraps , sounds and effects buttons .
Whether it is cell phones , digital cameras or flat TV screens , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> continues to dominate many sectors of technology and its manufacturing expertise is still world - class , and yet , it 's something of a paradox but after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</ENAMEX> of explosive internet growth around the world , only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> goes on line .
It is very difficult to rationally explain why because visibly it does n't make sense .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Daniels</ENAMEX> is President of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jupiter Telecommunications</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's largest cable operator .
You would think that companies are so knowledgeable , so educated , so technically literate that they would be at the forefront of the development .
Internet access fees here run <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 10</ENAMEX> times as high as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> , thanks to a near monopoly held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTT</ENAMEX> , the politically powerful former state owned telephone company .
Though its sky high rates are why <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> do n't go on line as much as citizens elsewhere , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jupiter</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniels</ENAMEX> says it all comes down to conservative , conformist , consensus lobbying <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> society itself that 's impeding growth of the internet here .
I think it really reverts back in to these traditional values , the way <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> are educated and basically individualism is not encouraged in neither school setting or corporate setting , and the people who are really making a difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> are individuals who are entrepreneurs .
They will come up with an idea , take the risk and lead .
They are not afraid to go against normal traditional ways of doing things and taking personal risk , and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> you do n't see that risk factor as evident as what you would find in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> .
Which partly explains why <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> political leaders such as Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoshiro Mori</ENAMEX> are in a fix .
Well , desperate to escape the economic stagnation that has mired this country for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">over a decade</ENAMEX> , they also worry that traditional ways of life would be swept aside by the internet with dotcom jobs replacing life - long employment security , e-commerce endangering business built on personal relationships .
They hate to see some of the traditional values that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> has always distinguished itself , starting to erode .
Again , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Daniels</ENAMEX> .
And there is a conflict that exists .
As you start moving down this path towards technical innovation , it invites disruption or it brings about the conflict much quicker than I think most people would be prepared to start dealing with it .
I think there is a lot of issues that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> is starting to question , how do they adapt , how do they change , how do they preserve what is good about their society while making these changes to be more competitive with what 's happening throughout the rest of the world .
In a crisis , such as right after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> has proven adept at rapid change , but in the past drastic reform has always been masterminded from above by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> bureaucrats .
A true internet connected society and economy wo n't emerge , say experts , without a grassroots led revolution , and that would be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> with this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2000 - year - old</ENAMEX> country .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The World</ENAMEX> , I am <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucy Craft</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> .
