A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Nations</ENAMEX> conference on global warming has ended without a deal .
Delegates worked through <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</ENAMEX> and past a deadline in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> to find ways to implement <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Kyoto Protocol</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Protocol</ENAMEX> 's objective is to reduce the earth 's heat - trapping gases by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">12 years</ENAMEX> .
Delegates have been unable to agree on how to do that .
The sticking point is how countries can reduce gas emissions without actually burning less fossil fuel .
