Setting up an Internet business : What do you need ?
Experience in setting up a business : My " boss " dream
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> stages of setting up a business from scratch
The critical path of success
Talking about setting up a business
Now , as the Internet grows , the Internet economy has passed through a " bubble era " and is gradually moving toward a dazzling springtime .
When you look at the IT giants that have sprouted up one after the other on the Internet , do you get excited ?
Are you worried ?
Are you determined ?
Setting up an Internet business is an idea that appeals to people .
Because : <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.</ENAMEX> Low cost
Unless they are undertaking a very large project , Internet entrepreneurs do not need much capital .
Perhaps one computer + ADSL + a dummy mainframe + a small room and you can get started .
But this is still far , far from success .
Some people may scoff that this ca n't be called setting up a business .
If you have plenty of funds , very sharp thinking , and a classic idea , you do n't need to read what I wrote .
But do n't stick up your nose ; for the time being we 're not talking about the relationship between capital and profit .
You feel that if the cost is insignificant , the profit must not be worth mentioning .
Well , now I 'm telling you you're 're wrong .
This traditional cost - profit relationship just does n't work on the Internet .
Because you 've overlooked one thing , and that 's your own intelligence and ability .
In setting up an Internet business , this holds a more important position .
The Internet is absolutely a place for the daring to be forceful .
If you have the ability , you can hope to succeed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.</ENAMEX> Low start - up cost
Internet communications are now well developed .
It can be said that all you need is broadband , and you 've solved most of your Internet communication problems and can save yourself a lot of telephone charges .
At the same time , you do n't need to go out and rent a storefront and pay exorbitant rents .
Early on , before you 've formally registered the company , you also do n't have to be bothered with lots of petty charges and taxes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.</ENAMEX> Staffing is very simple ; in the early stages many entrepreneurs start from scratch , with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> person handling all tasks .
Because <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> person can basically cope with everything in the early stages , there is no need to incur personnel costs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.</ENAMEX> The risk is low , so if the business fails , you do n't need to be afraid .
Because the initial investment is low , there are greater opportunities for turnover .
Therefore the entrepreneur can give up without fearing the consequences of failure .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.</ENAMEX> High profit
If you succeed early on in setting up your business and continue on down the right path of development , then I congratulate you .
Now you can shout it out : " My Web site is making a profit ! "
But do n't let the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> bucket of money you make go to your head .
Do n't forget , the higher you climb , the higher you 'll fall .
Remind yourself that now is the time you need to keep a close watch on developments in market trends and among your competitors .
Promptly adjust your growth strategy .
Only then will you be smiling at the end .
Maybe when you read about the advantages of establishing an Internet business above , your heart was racing and you were thinking you 'd really work hard to make it .
Below I 'm going to discuss some of the areas that you need to pay attention to when setting up an Internet business :
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.</ENAMEX> Use your own unique vision to examine the Internet and look for new ways to make a profit .
Aggressively investigate new projects ; avoid blindly imitating others .
Are there lots of people doing this kind of thing on the Internet ?
If a flashA.com appears on the Net today , tomorrow there will be flashC.com and flashD.com .
If that 's the case , your odds of failing just increased by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> .
Remember : If you 're always following on somebody else 's tail , then what you'll get will always be someone else 's trash , picked over , cast aside and unused .
Of course we 're not opposed to imitating , but what we should think about is why is this person taking that route , and not which route is this person taking .
Then we will study the line of thought and the skills he used to solve problems .
So we will gain more than he did .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.</ENAMEX> If you 've selected a given project and are carrying it out , then you should definitely carry it through to the end ; avoid switching course in midstream .
Of course when I say see it through to the end , this does not mean to continue blindly , sticking with it even when you know full well it 's hopeless .
What I mean is , do n't be distracted , doing SMS today and selling things tomorrow , with a new approach every day .
You see somebody else doing something that makes money , and you think you want to do that .
Your website is simply the " art of changing your look " like in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sichuan</ENAMEX> opera .
A new face every day , completely different .
What I recommend is that when you set up your business you should give it careful consideration and fully investigate its feasibility .
Once you set out to do something , you should pursue the goal you set for yourself , sticking with it unless really forced to give up .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.</ENAMEX> Use your hands , eyes and brain , be observant and alert , and consider all possibilities .
Avoid acting rashly when you set up your Internet business .
Your mind needs to be sharp ; the Internet offers virtually unlimited business opportunities ; maybe it 's just a small opportunity , but you should seize it .
Then maybe you will succeed .
Otherwise if the opportunity was right in front of you and you did n't seize it .
So ... you need nimble hands .
If you come upon something important , by all means make a note of it , and so on .
Your eyes need to be sharp : you need to spot changes in the IT situation right away and quickly prepare a short - term business plan .
Like right now , many portal sites are seizing the opportunity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX> to considerably increase their traffic .
I think advertising revenues in this area alone will be considerable .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.</ENAMEX> Be tough and resilient : avoid the easy route .
Setting up an Internet business is hard labor .
When you 're just setting up your business , it is sometimes hard to avoid feeling completely exhausted .
Sometimes you 'll just feel like throwing in the towel .
Do n't forget : if you were working for someone else , you would n't like it either , and may feel even worse !
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.</ENAMEX> You need to learn to look for partners .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.</ENAMEX> You need to know what Internet marketing is , and learn how to use it .
Are you looking for an already proven , feasible way to increase your sources of income ?
Are you looking for an opportunity to create both free time and financial freedom ?
Do you have dreams or goals that you want to reach ?
