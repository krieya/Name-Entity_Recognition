Mourn for the End of an Era : <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> Cultural Giants
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Li</ENAMEX> / tr. by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Barnard</ENAMEX> -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">The year 2001</ENAMEX> has started with a series of saddening losses in the cultural realm .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first of the year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu Tsang-houei</ENAMEX> , the dean of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> music , passed away after a fall left him in a coma .
Then came the news that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Kwang-chih</ENAMEX> , the respected archeologist and former vice-president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Academia Sinica</ENAMEX> , had died of illness in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> .
Finally , on the afternoon of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 9</ENAMEX> , the historian <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tai Kuo-hui</ENAMEX> died of septicemia .
These <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> masters in their fields were all in their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early seventies</ENAMEX> .
Since they had just reached a time in their lives and careers where they could slow down and enjoy the fruits of their past labors , one feels inclined to complain to heaven or sigh about the brevity of life .
Each of these men was at the forefront of his field in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , and their deaths represent the end of an era .
Where should <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> music go ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu Tsang-houei</ENAMEX> had a huge impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> music over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last half century</ENAMEX> .
Born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Homei , Changhua</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu</ENAMEX> studied the violin in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> as a youth .
Later , he studied in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> , where he became well versed in the various schools of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> music .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</ENAMEX> he returned to introduce modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> classical music to his homeland .
He also published a seminal essay entitled , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">" Where Should Chinese Music Go ? "</ENAMEX> in which he passionately urged his fellow musicians to create contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> music .
Many young composers took up his call and wrote difficult and dissonant <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve</ENAMEX> - tone works that would become the creative mainstream in music departments .
Unfortunately , schools of modern classical music struggled to hold their audiences even in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> , and audiences found it harder and harder to connect with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> modern music of which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu</ENAMEX> was the leading figure .
Opinion has remained polarized about the worth of this music .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu</ENAMEX> was also at the forefront of efforts to record traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> folk music .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1960s</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shih Wei-liang</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu Ping-chuan</ENAMEX> and others established various organizations , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Folk Music Research Workshop</ENAMEX> .
Fighting the reigning bias in favor of musical traditions from the mainland , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu</ENAMEX> led the way in collecting and recording <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> Nanguan music and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> - tone , as well as the music of the aboriginal tribes .
These collections helped to delineate the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> music .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</ENAMEX> , with the rise of the " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> " movement in politics , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu</ENAMEX> 's folk music collections have garnered more and more attention , and CDs of them have been released one after another .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu</ENAMEX> was appointed both as national policy advisor to the president and as the chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Culture and Arts Foundation</ENAMEX> .
Cross-strait archeological star
Just as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu</ENAMEX> 's work spanned from the classical to the contemporary , from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> to his native soil , the archaeologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Kwang-chih</ENAMEX> 's broad vision allowed him to build the foundations for the field of archeology both for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> as a whole .
In his autobiography , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> describes himself as a " Yam Man , " which is an allusion to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> being shaped like a yam .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> explains that he was actually born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> , though his father 's family was indeed from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> was returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> rule , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> returned to the land of his roots .
Studying at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chienkuo High</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</ENAMEX> , he was arrested on false charges of having participated in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the April 6 Incident</ENAMEX> .
He spent nearly a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> in jail before taking the high school equivalency exam and going on to study archeology at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> .
After earning his doctorate at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvard</ENAMEX> , he took an academic post in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> but always maintained his focus on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> archeology .
Largely due to his unflagging efforts , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> archeology attained a sturdy theoretical and practical foundation that enabled it to emerge as a world-class discipline .
His research showed that the rise of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> civilization did not occur exclusively in the area around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Yellow River Valley</ENAMEX> .
Rather it emerged from several languages , ethnic groups and cultures spread over a vast landscape .
This overturned the " single origin theory " and debunked <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> assumptions about " oriental despotism . "
Though a world-class scholar , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> never forgot the land of his origins .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</ENAMEX> , he returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and embarked on research at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Fengpitou</ENAMEX> site in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kaohsiung</ENAMEX> , completing the most extensive archeological study made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> in over a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">century</ENAMEX> .
Then he went on to perform research in an area that spanned the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Choshui</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Tatu</ENAMEX> river valleys .
It was a huge undertaking that involved both archeology and geology .
Many of the leading lights among the younger generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> anthropologists cut their research teeth on this project .
Unfortunately , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Kwang-chih</ENAMEX> became afflicted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parkinson</ENAMEX> 's disease <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a decade ago</ENAMEX> .
His limbs started to shake , and it became impossible for him to perform fieldwork .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> deeply regretted that he was unable to examine the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Shangqiu</ENAMEX> site in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Henan</ENAMEX> .
Though sick , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> returned home at the end of his life to serve as vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Academia Sinica</ENAMEX> , where he worked hard to establish <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> as the preeminent world center for sinology .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> heart , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> sentiments
Finally there was the death of the historian <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tai Kuo-hui</ENAMEX> , who served on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Security Council</ENAMEX> and was admired as much for his lofty character as for his pioneering work in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> history .
His differences of opinion with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng-hui</ENAMEX> had thrust him into the spotlight in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
Born in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taoyuan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tai</ENAMEX> was educated under <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> colonial rule , and he earned a doctorate in agriculture at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> .
Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> history was still a taboo subject in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tai</ENAMEX> organized a research society in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> devoted to the study of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> history and other related <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> topics .
For this work , he was blacklisted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
Later , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tai</ENAMEX> repeatedly declined invitations from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Ching-kuo</ENAMEX> to return .
It was n't until <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng-hui</ENAMEX> was president that he finally came home .
But when he did , his different perspective about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> history brought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tai Kuo-hui</ENAMEX> farther and farther from the mainstream of the ruling party .
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tai</ENAMEX> did n't flinch from condemning the authoritarianism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Kai-shek</ENAMEX> and his son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Ching-kuo</ENAMEX> , he also had harsh things to say about <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> colonial rule - unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng-hui</ENAMEX> , who had fond memories of the colonial era .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tai</ENAMEX> , who described himself as an " independent-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , " never lost his affection for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> proper , and these sentiments set him apart from most historians of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
With regard to cross-strait relations , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tai</ENAMEX> made his famous " testicles analogy . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taiwan</ENAMEX> is a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , he stated , just as testicles are a part of a man 's body .
Though inextricably linked to the body , the testicles have their own special functions .
He based his analogy on what he deemed was best for all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> people .
His theory was a far cry from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng-hui 's</ENAMEX> belief that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> should establish clear boundaries between itself and the mainland .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tai Kuo-hui</ENAMEX> never shied from controversy .
Otherwise , he would not have chosen to study <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> history to begin with .
Throughout his life , he maintained his tough <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> spirit and academic independence , holding fast to his opinions and never compromising .
He was greatly admired for his intellectual integrity .
These great masters ' deaths have come at a time when the field of education has been in the spotlight for other reasons .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Ministry of Education</ENAMEX> has just formally apologized - <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</ENAMEX> after the fact - for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the April 6 Incident</ENAMEX> , and a university president has been found guilty of plagiarizing a research paper .
The former shows that intellectuals in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> need no longer fear torture and imprisonment for their beliefs .
The latter suggests that some people have allowed blind ambition to sully the pure ideal of scholarship .
Apart from causing us to mourn , the deaths of these great men have left us with a lot to think about .

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu Tsang-houei</ENAMEX> introduced modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> classical music to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> before making pioneering collections of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> music .
His major opera on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zheng Chenggong</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koxinga</ENAMEX> -RRB- debuted just <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .

Though afflicted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parkinson</ENAMEX> 's disease in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">his later years</ENAMEX> , he nonetheless served as vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Academia Sinica</ENAMEX> .
He made a major contribution toward developing the field of archeology in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .

" Only with a true understanding of history can we clearly chart a future path ! "
What people respected most about the historian <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tai Kuo-hui</ENAMEX> was his determination to face historical truth and his refusal to heed prevailing dogma and political fashion .
The photo shows him at a forum discussing the island 's political future in the wake of the last presidential election , which transferred power from one party to another .
