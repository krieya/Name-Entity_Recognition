<ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Two hundred and fifteen</ENAMEX> innocents were killed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> , with their limbs flown everywhere and flesh all over the bloody ground .
This results in the biggest death toll since the deposing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunni</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiite</ENAMEX> factions have quickly competed to blame each other , making this shocking massacre , which no one will admit , seem even more horrific .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , who ca n't even protect himself , has long given up his cowboy act .
Before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</ENAMEX> he released turkeys according to tradition , yet untraditionally , he admitted that " the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> war is now like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> war . "
I do n't know what the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraqi</ENAMEX> authorities , who are struggling hard to survive , are going to think .
Perhaps the summit that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> are planning is their move to seek for self - salvation .
But one of the participants of the summit is unexpectedly none other than the mortal enemy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> does n't evade it , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> can not block it , this is enough to show that those <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">215</ENAMEX> wronged spirits have actually found peace .
There came the news of an explosion at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Moscow University</ENAMEX> .
No one was hurt , but it was a serious psychological blow .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Moscow University</ENAMEX> is a symbol of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> .
Its position is even higher than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Harvard</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> .
If people 's evil conduct even befalls such hallowed ground , then the hurt it causes to the people 's heart and even the president can be easily imagined .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> was already feeling down and upset .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> insists that that defected spy who died in exile in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> was eliminated on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> 's orders .
They 've gone on to call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> " a cold war schemer . "
The handsome and cool - styled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> has become furious , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> government issuing a very strongly worded denial as well .
But the all too credible " last words of the spy , " together with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> 's own background in espionage , have still managed to put a scowl on the face of this modern popular leader at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">EU</ENAMEX> summit .
