In a lively and well - attended ceremony on an unusually warm and sunny winter 's day , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Yingko Ceramics Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei County</ENAMEX> is formally opened to the public .
Especially noteworthy is Room <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">203</ENAMEX> , " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Echoes Across Space - Time</ENAMEX> , " where there is an exhibit that seems quite out of the ordinary : rough sandy earth , an upright measuring stick . . . it is more like the site of an archeological dig .
The layers of prehistoric pottery represent different cultures that existed at various times in the past .
It is almost impossible to tell that these rudimentary yet beautiful works of pottery are not the real thing .
They are in fact reproductions by the potter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng Yung - gwo</ENAMEX> .
It is especially fitting that they should be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> 's work , because this unusual artist was formerly a student of archeology .
Let 's go back to the eve of the opening .
The museum - located very near the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Yingko</ENAMEX> interchange of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Second Northern Freeway</ENAMEX> - is hopping with people scurrying and working inside and out .
In the main hall on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> floor stand <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a dozen</ENAMEX> giant porcelain vases , representing the pottery industry of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Yingko</ENAMEX> .
When you climb to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> floor , in Room <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">201</ENAMEX> a worker is stirring cement with all his might in preparation for putting up a decorative wall of cement interspersed with ceramic pieces .
And in Room <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">203</ENAMEX> , a group of people are busy putting the finished reproductions on display , documenting the process on video as they go along .
Suddenly there is a crash , followed by a gasp , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu Hsiu - chin</ENAMEX> , director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Research and Collections Department</ENAMEX> , rushes in to see what has happened .
A camera lens has fallen off and struck a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yuanshan Culture</ENAMEX> jar .
" Teacher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> , is there anything wrong ? " asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu</ENAMEX> nervously .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng Yung - gwo</ENAMEX> turns the piece in his hands , examining it carefully for damage .
Then he raises his head and smiles : " It 's a good thing I increased the kiln temperature to make these things more durable , because I was worried about the knocks they would take being moved around for the exhibition . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng Yung - gwo</ENAMEX> , who is addressed by the respectful title " Teacher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> " by all the museum staff high and low , is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">the Young Turks</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> ceramics scene .
He <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> gained fame with an award - winnnig entry in the annual <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Golden Ceramics Award</ENAMEX> competition .
But the most important reason why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Yingko Ceramics Museum</ENAMEX> gave him sole and total control over the recreation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</ENAMEX> pieces of prehistoric pottery in the exhibit is this : He is the only leading ceramicist in all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> who also graduated from university with a degree in archeology .
A great deal of effort has been devoted to opening new museums in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
Besides institutions devoted to the natural sciences , the main focus has been on local <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> history and aboriginal culture .
Examples include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Museum of Prehistory</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei County 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yingko Ceramics Museum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shihsanhang Museum</ENAMEX> , and the privately founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sheng Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines</ENAMEX> .
For museums , the most important thing is of course to acquire items to display .
But most archeological artifacts are only shards , and the few items that have been found intact are jealously guarded by the institutions that dug them up ; they are rarely lent out .
Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Yingko Ceramics Museum 's</ENAMEX> only option was to find someone to make copies of the originals .
This was vital because , during the planning stage for the museum , it was decided to establish a very special room to be called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">" Echoes Across Space - Time</ENAMEX> . "
" We felt that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> ceramics should cover more than just what <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Han</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> people have done in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 400 years</ENAMEX> since large - scale migration began from the mainland , but should also include aboriginal and prehistoric pottery .
But it is quite a challenge to effectively create such a comprehensive display , especially since authentic pieces are so hard to come by . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu Hsiu - chin</ENAMEX> reveals that most of the genuine items are held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Department of Archeology and Anthropology</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Taiwan University</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> -RRB- or by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Institute of History and Philology</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Academia Sinica</ENAMEX> .
Hung up on red tape
The museum sent a written request to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> asking to borrow samples from which copies could be made , but that idea quickly hit the shoals .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> 's archeology departmental affairs committee decided that the museum should have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> submitted a cooperation proposal prior to asking for any loans .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu Hsiu - chin</ENAMEX> says with exasperation : " This was not an unreasonable request .
But by that point we had no time to lose , and it would have been problematic to file a retroactive proposal . "
After asking around , the museum found an old gent - a specialist in making fiberglass reproductions of old artifacts - who had done similar work for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Museum of Prehistory</ENAMEX> .
But when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu</ENAMEX> examined the finished products , though the shapes were super , the reproductions did n't capture the texture of the original visually , much less when picked up in the hand .
At this point , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu</ENAMEX> had little choice but to turn for help to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu I - chang</ENAMEX> , a research fellow at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Institute of History and Philology</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu I - chang</ENAMEX> is renowned in the archeological community in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> for his field research .
He has done the initial field work on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</ENAMEX> of important sites , including <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shihsanhang</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Tachuwei</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Peiyeh</ENAMEX> .
His ambition is to uncover the relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's indigenous peoples and its prehistoric cultures .
He is also the one who was asked to select the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</ENAMEX> prehistoric pottery samples to be displayed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Yingko Ceramics Museum</ENAMEX> .
In love with archeology
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> for advice about people qualified to do reproductions of ancient pottery .
She hit the jackpot , because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> happened to have a good friend named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng Yung - gwo</ENAMEX> , a ceramic artist , who had also studied in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Department of Archeology and Anthropology</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> behind me in school , and we worked together on digs for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</ENAMEX> .
When he was in college , he worked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Peinan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chihshanyen</ENAMEX> sites , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Peinan</ENAMEX> society had highly developed pottery arts , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chihshanyen</ENAMEX> is a multi-layered site with artifacts from several cultures , and the pottery is even more refined .
In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> 's inspiration for ceramics originally came from archeology .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> continues : " Though later <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> left archeology to do ceramic art , he did not forget his affection for prehistoric pottery , and his early work was influenced by ancient painted pottery . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> notes that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> there has been growing demand for archeological artifacts for displays , precisely fitting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> 's familiarity with ceramic art and his understanding of archeological work .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu Hsiu - chin</ENAMEX> says , with the satisfaction that comes of knowing one has got just what one wants , " He is the ideal person to do reproductions of prehistoric pottery . "
A ceramicist who reads academic papers
In fact , this is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> time that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> has done reproductions of prehistoric pottery .
He previously worked on special exhibitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Chihshanyen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Yuanshan</ENAMEX> culture and also for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Taiwan Provincial Museum</ENAMEX> .
But never before had he been given a task as challenging as making reproductions representing all the major sites of prehistoric pottery in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
In the process of making his recreations , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> was unable to get around the rigid system of controls to secure any original samples .
" What is so incredible about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng Yung - gwo</ENAMEX> is that he only looked at the samples and took back some photographs to work with , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu I - chang</ENAMEX> .
Take for example the human - faced jar from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shisanhang</ENAMEX> culture .
The visage depicted on the piece is of complex design , with sharp angles and corners .
For the work to be faithful to the original each angle had to be precise .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> tackled this problem by assembling a number of paper models before getting to work .
But he also had to try to duplicate the red color of the piece , a color characteristic of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shisanhang</ENAMEX> pottery .
For this reason <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> made a special trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Linkou Plateau</ENAMEX> to collect red clay .
But he found this material impossible to get into the right shape , so he had to add a certain proportion of general - purpose potter 's clay .
After several tries , he settled on a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> parts <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Tachia</ENAMEX> clay to one part <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Linkou</ENAMEX> clay , with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</ENAMEX> ratio of gravel , and a layer of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Linkou</ENAMEX> red clay added to the outside .
Finally , he polished the surface with agate , creating a glossy effect and increasing the richness of the color .
Like a detective on a case
Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu I - chang</ENAMEX> could n't say enough about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> 's human - faced jar .
Pointing to the photo on the cover of the brochure for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shisanhang</ENAMEX> site museum , he testifies : " I was the person who dug up the original , so I should know - the color in the photograph is not right , while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> is much closer to the real thing . "
For <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> , the hardest thing was the facial expression .
" The face is not smiling , but it is not crying either , rather it looks a bit depressed . "
He says that this is a very impractical piece , so its original purpose was probably decorative or ritualistic .
In an effort to capture the ambivalent facial expression , he imagined the jar as a bust - length portrait of a woman .
She would be an elegantly dressed noblewoman , with brushed hair , and jewelry made from shells , with perhaps an agate necklace . . . .
" During his days as a student , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> , " he did hands - on work at archeological sites , digging up shards , observing , and in his mind recreating the process by which they may have been made .
He has always had a naturally deep attachment to archeology . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> says that this is probably the reason why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> , when doing reproductions of prehistoric pottery , aims to capture the spirit of the originals , not just their surface appearance .
Even more important for reproducing prehistoric artifacts is good detective work .
You have to be able to reconstruct the general design of the original from clues on just a few shards .
Conclusions that rest on a single sample may easily be inaccurate .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> , using his training in archeology and the concept of " correlation , " is able to link together a single sample with pieces from the same culture found nearby , allowing him to draw conclusions with confidence and to bring his creative abilities into play while remaining true to the original .
Reproducing the spirit of prehistoric pottery
Stop right there !
You might wonder : If he is making reproductions , how can he bring creativity into it ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> 's response is this : " I think that the original potters also followed their whims and improvised when they worked , and did n't rigidly make each embellishment by rote . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> considers the problem and then adds : " I not only want to reproduce the appearance of the originals , but also the spirit of the people who made them . "
The reconstruction of an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ilan</ENAMEX> square - patterned pottery jar found by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu I - chang</ENAMEX> in the town of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chiushe</ENAMEX> is a good illustration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> 's whole approach .
Upon inspecting the original , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> discovered that the walls were very thin .
If the decorative pattern had been stamped on after the clay had been formed , it would certainly have ruined the shape .
So how did the original maker get the pattern on there ?
Having repeatedly thought about this problem , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> concluded that prehistoric potters must have used an internal mold when working .
Perhaps they had shards that they could just pick up from the ground around them .
They could take the kneaded clay , wrap it on the outside of the shards , and tap it down lightly with a wooden stick to make the clay more compact and solid .
The stick would have patterns carved into it which would then be left imprinted on the clay .
But this decorative effect , thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> , was probably <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">secondary</ENAMEX> to the functional purpose of compacting the clay .
With these ideas in mind , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> ground up a handful of gravel , added it to the clay , and kneaded it vigorously .
Then he took a mold that had been made from the original sample , and spread the clay - now with the texture of pizza dough - on the outside .
Then he tapped it with a small stick , which he had personally prepared by paring off the bark and carving a pattern of squares into the wood .
Next he cut away the bottom of the jar and carefully removed it .
He repeated the process to make the top section , then connected the upper and lower parts .
Then , with his right hand he picked up the wood stick and tapped around the outside , while with his left he held a mushroom - shaped object against the inside of the jar to absorb the shock and prevent the jar from collapsing inward .
A careful examination of the finished jar - with its square pattern already imprinted - showed it to look exactly like the sample in the photo .
Dialogue with academia
To reconstruct these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</ENAMEX> pieces of pottery , as much as he could <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> used the same tools as were available to their original makers .
In particular , he avoided using any iron implements , since none had been available back then .
When making the ceramic boar , he went into the bamboo forest in front of his house and cut off bamboo branches by hand to serve as the pig 's nostrils .
When there were no ready - made tools available , he made his own , such as the above - mentioned " mushroom head . "
" Such a ' mushroom head ' was unearthed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Peinan</ENAMEX> site , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> , " and archeologists had no idea what it was for .
But people like me who make pottery can identify its function with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> look . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu I - chang</ENAMEX> states that his conversations with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> have given him much food for thought and allowed him to more accurately visualize the lifestyles and technology of prehistoric peoples .
" We help each other a lot . "
For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> has brought his ceramicist 's mind 's eye to bear on the mystery of why gravel was mixed into prehistoric pottery .
In virtually all archeological reports , prehistoric pottery includes gravel , usually at a level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 - 30 %</ENAMEX> .
Some also includes shells or hornblende .
This is definitely not because prehistoric people were unable to get clay of greater purity .
On the contrary , the clay they used was often of higher quality than clay <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> concludes that the inclusion of gravel must have been deliberate .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> explains : " These days most ceramic artists buy factory - produced clay that meets a certain set of specifications .
Rarely would anybody add gravel .
After all , everybody uses electric kilns , because they offer precise temperature control , so their pieces can be fired slowly , with no risk of cracking from overly rapid heating or cooling . "
Prehistoric wisdom
But prehistoric peoples did not possess any of these things .
They had to dig , rinse , and filter their own clay , shape the pieces , then fire them all together in a big pile of wood under the open sky .
This is why they added gravel to the clay , liking mixing stones into mud , to increase its strength and so avoid having the pottery fracture as it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> expanded under the heat and then contracted as it cooled .
From this we can see , affirms <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> , that " prehistoric people understood how to use mixed materials , which was a major breakthrough in technique . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> found further indirect confirmation of his judgement about the technical skills possessed by prehistoric makers of pottery from a documentary on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NHK</ENAMEX> network .
In the film , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> ceramic artist , an individual who is considered a " national treasure " of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , goes to visit a small island in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> where everybody makes pottery .
When he arrives there , this great master becomes more like a youthful acolyte .
As the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> ceramicist slowly and steadily works the clay at his wheel , an elderly aboriginal woman working next to him just turns the wheel twice with her feet and shapes a finished ceramic jug .
The ability of the indigenous people on this small island to judge the quality of clay was even more impressive .
" They just toss some clay into their mouths and chew it around for a while , and they know whether it is good material or not .
When we buy clay , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> thing we look at is the written specifications , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> with a laugh .
Firebrand
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> was able to complete the full set of prehistoric pottery reproductions requested by the museum , and at a level of quality that received high grades from the museum and from consultant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu I - chang</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> himself still feels there are things that he could have done better .
" The hardest part was getting the final color and texture of the originals to come through in the reproductions . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> relates that in this regard there were some factors he could manipulate , but others that were beyond his control .
" What kind of clay did prehistoric people use ?
At what temperature did they fire the pots ?
You do n't get the same feeling from artifacts that have been buried in the ground for thousands of years , exposed to microbes and chemical transformations , that you can get instantly from the recreated works that I am doing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> admits that if he utilized extraneous processes , such as exposing the pieces to wood smoke for a long time , he could get the colors closer to those of the actual artifacts , but then he would be losing something else at the same time .
Thus , before getting down to work on the final version of each piece , he made numerous trials , using different proportions of iron oxide , trying different temperatures , sometimes buffing the piece to make it glossy and other times not , to get as close as possible to the correct overall effect .
And then of course there was the problem that the pottery - making process in prehistoric times was markedly different from the modern procedure .
" These days we use electric kilns .
Though they are safer , they do not leave the same traces that prehistoric pottery has from being fired outdoors with uneven exposure to the heat . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> feels very strongly about this .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> mythology , man escaped the fate of the other animals by stealing fire from the gods , and it was fire that allowed the rise of bronze - age civilization and pottery cultures .
But now , fire has been taken offstage , and replaced by electricity .
The relationship between fire and potters has been severed by modern kilns .
" There is only the moment when you turn on the power - click - there is no physical sensation of kindling wood or smoke . "
Back to the tribal experience
After mulling over his experiences , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> decided that he is going to save up money to build the finest wood - fire pottery kiln in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
This could not only restore the relationship between fire and potter , but could also induce <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's ceramic artists - among whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> believes there is currently too much division and distance - to cooperate with each other .
" This could encourage interaction and partnership , and even in a small way create a sense of having returned to the tribal village . "
Now that 's a lovely thought .
Beside a road in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Emei Rural Township</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hsinchu</ENAMEX> , the kind of narrow , winding mountain road where you need to beep your horn continually to warn possible oncoming cars around the corner , in the home that he and his wife <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shen Tung - ching</ENAMEX> built with their own hands , just next to a pond surrounded by all kinds of large trees , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng Yung - gwo</ENAMEX> dreams of himself sitting with a group of friends and colleagues around a fire , " alternately firing pottery and drinking wine . "

In reproducing prehistoric pottery , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng Yung - gwo</ENAMEX> used a wooden block of his own making to compact and strengthen the clay .
He aspired not only to reproduce the originals , but to rediscover the spirit of their original makers .
