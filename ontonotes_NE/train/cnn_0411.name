<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than a million</ENAMEX> babies awaiting adoption in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> family is now bigger by one .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Tonight</ENAMEX> they 're welcoming little <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abby Kramer</ENAMEX> in the world .
Was anything but simple .
Her new mom and dad had to contend with international red tape , traveling <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands of miles</ENAMEX> to meet the new addition and cope with the SARS crisis going on in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
Their story is remarkable .

Reporter :
After waiting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly a year</ENAMEX> , things get a little complicated for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kramers</ENAMEX> .

Do you have masks ?
Yes , actually , we did bring some masks .

They 're heading to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quinn Joe</ENAMEX> .
We understand that 's where the SARS epidemic started from and we 're going right to the heart .
Reporter :
Nothing will stop them .
What would you tell her about somehow she came to you and why she was given up ?
The people that gave birth to you are not necessarily your mom and dad .
They 're the ones that love you and care for you .
We are .
Reporter :
Finally , It 's time to go , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">16 - hour</ENAMEX> flight to look forward to --
it 's been a total rollercoaster .
Reporter :
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kramers</ENAMEX> are finally on their way .
With our video camera , they record their journey .
We just boarded the plane .
The flight attendants are wearing masks .
Reporter :
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kramers</ENAMEX> decide not to , neither do the other <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</ENAMEX> adoptive families on the long overseas trip .
We just got off , so our <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">16 - hour</ENAMEX> flight is over .
Reporter :
The families begin with a tour .
An alligator , my goodness .
Reporter :
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kramers</ENAMEX> must wait and travel to another town for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abby</ENAMEX> .

Reporter :
Finally the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kramers</ENAMEX> meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abby</ENAMEX> .
Hi , there .
I kind of leaned over and gave her a kiss on the forehead and she looked up and --
Reporter :
They know little about their little girl , found by the side of the road <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">days</ENAMEX> after she was born .
She spent most of her life in an orphannage .
Now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abby</ENAMEX> has a new life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kramers</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> kids .
I think I love her more every day , every time I look at her .
Reporter :
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thelma Gutierrez</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
Well , it is our turn to meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kramers</ENAMEX> back in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> after their journey to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> to bring home the newest and cutest perhaps , member of their family , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , the proud parents of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">11 month</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abigail Kramer</ENAMEX> .
Thank you for being with us .
Thank you for having us .
She is unbelievably adorable .
Thanks .
Tell us a little about this journey , that moment when you first saw her .
You traveled .
This is going on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> .
You battled bureaucracy , traveling <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands of miles</ENAMEX> , facing disease .
What was that like ?
Incredible , you know , just to hold her in our arms , have her with us .
I mean , you count the moments , and it was just anticipation all the way there .
So it was relief .
It was , you know , a dream come true .
She was -- she 's really a delight .
I mean , though it was a little pandemonium at the moment , she 's wonderful .
We love her .
And , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> , it was -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time you were holding her , it looked like she was crying a lot .
She seemed startled to see someone that looked so different .
Yes , this was probably her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> experience ever seeing a fair - skinned , bearded goatee , monster - looking guy and she just freaked out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time she saw me .
It took <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about a day and a half</ENAMEX> for her to warm up .
I had to hide in the hotel room .
She would find me in the room and start crying every time she saw me .
You had to hide in the hotel room ?
Yeah , she 'd find me across the room and break into tears .
It was kind of that way with anyone that was blond , that was fair - skinned .
Yeah .
When you <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> heard about Sars , I mean , did you suddenly think , this may not happen ? this could stop the whole thing .
Sure .
We got calls <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">that morning</ENAMEX> saying `` Did you hear that they 're halting all travel ? '' and we put in a call to the agency , we were going , and we put a lot of trust in our agency , and they were great .
You know , unless we were absolutely stopped , we were going .
Right .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> of working towards it , we were almost more afraid not to go than to go at the very end .
You know , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> , I hope this is n't too personal a question .
If it is , just simply tell me to shut up .
But when -- in the story I saw <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abby</ENAMEX> was abandoned on the side of the road , which is just -- it 's unthinkable .
You ca n't even imagine a parent doing that .
What do you think you 're going to tell her when she grows up about how she came to live with you ?
Well , I get emotional every time I -- someone asks that , but we 're going to give her the best love and affection we can and give her a strong self esteem and we 're going to teach her --
