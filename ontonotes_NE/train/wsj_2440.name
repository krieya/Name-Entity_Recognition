<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Business Week</ENAMEX> subscribers may hear this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> 's issue talking back to them .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - page ad from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Instruments Inc.</ENAMEX> , running in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 140,000</ENAMEX> issues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 20</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Corporate Elite</ENAMEX> '' issue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McGraw - Hill Inc.</ENAMEX> publication , contains a speech synthesizer laminated between <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of the pages .
Readers who pull off a piece of tape and press a switch will hear a tiny -- but distinctly human - sounding -- voice announce , `` I am the talking chip , '' as it launches into a <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">15 - second</ENAMEX> discourse on its own attributes .
The talking chip is n't cheap -- the per - ad cost to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 4</ENAMEX> , and that 's without adding in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Business Week 's</ENAMEX> charge -- but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> believes it is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> .
Previous efforts have included musical ads , featuring simple tone - generating chips that play a tune , but the voice synthesizer in this effort is much more sophisticated , with none of the robotic flatness that one hears , for example , when calling telephone directory services .
And for those who miss the message the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time around , not to worry : <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> tiny batteries provide enough juice for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 650</ENAMEX> replays .
