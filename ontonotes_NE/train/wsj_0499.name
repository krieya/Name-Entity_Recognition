<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The French Economics Ministry</ENAMEX> approved a planned asset swap between the defense and electronics group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Thomson - CSF S.A.</ENAMEX> and the bank group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Credit Lyonnais</ENAMEX> .
The ministry said the swap , details of which were disclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Thursday</ENAMEX> , will allow both state - controlled companies to reinforce operations in their main markets and argued that the move shows the dynamism of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> 's state - sector concerns .
The approval also ends any hope that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Banque Nationale de Paris</ENAMEX> , another state - sector bank , might have had about taking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Credit Lyonnais 's</ENAMEX> place in the accord .
It hinted over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</ENAMEX> that it would have been interested in a hook - up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Thomson - CSF</ENAMEX> .
Under details of the accord , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Credit Lyonnais</ENAMEX> will take slightly more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Thomson - CSF Finance</ENAMEX> in exchange for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 14 %</ENAMEX> of its own shares .
The move will help the bank to keep up with international solvency ratios being phased in by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bank for International Settlements</ENAMEX> and will also represent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time that its voting shares have been held by a party other than the government .
