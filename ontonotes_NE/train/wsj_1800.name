<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> sent President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18.4 billion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Postal Service</ENAMEX> bill providing <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.5 billion</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> and increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Customs Service 's</ENAMEX> air - interdiction program nearly a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">third</ENAMEX> .
Final approval came on a simple voice vote in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> , and the swift passage contrasted with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> of negotiations over the underlying bill which is laced with special - interest provisions for both members and the executive branch .
An estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 33 million</ENAMEX> was added for university and science grants , including <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 million</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Smith College</ENAMEX> .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Southwest</ENAMEX> lawmakers were a driving force behind <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 54.6 million</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - Mexico border facilities , or more than double the administration 's request .
More than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 million</ENAMEX> is allocated for pensions and expenses for former presidents , and the budget for the official residence of Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX> is more than doubled , with $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">200,000</ENAMEX> designated for improvements to the property .
Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> is remembered with an extra <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</ENAMEX> to help offset pay costs that other government departments are being asked to absorb .
Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> , nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.95 billion</ENAMEX> is provided for processing tax returns , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</ENAMEX> increase over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1989</ENAMEX> and double what the government was spending <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</ENAMEX> .
Investigation and taxpayer service accounts would grow to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6 billion</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> specifically added <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.4 million</ENAMEX> for stepped up criminal investigations of money laundering related to drug traffic .
The large increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Customs Service</ENAMEX> air - interdiction funds is also intended to counter smuggling , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> appropriations level has more than quadrupled in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 196.7 million</ENAMEX> provided for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1990</ENAMEX> anticipates the purchase of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lockheed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P - 3</ENAMEX> surveillance aircraft and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cessna</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Citation II</ENAMEX> jets .
Despite administration reservations , the plan has had the quiet backing of customs officials as well as influential lawmakers from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cessna</ENAMEX> 's home state , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> .
Among legislative provisions attached to the bill is a ban on any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury Department</ENAMEX> expenditure for enforcement of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> tax provision intended to counter discrimination in employee - benefit plans .
Small - business interests have lobbied against the so - called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 89</ENAMEX> tax rules .
Repeal is considered likely now , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury Department</ENAMEX> bill has been used as a vehicle to raise the profile of the issue and block any action in the interim .
Less noticed is a bit of legislative legerdemain by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">HEI Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> to retroactively `` move '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> hospital from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">county</ENAMEX> to the next to justify higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Medicare</ENAMEX> reimbursements .
The provision seeks to wipe out <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 1.4 million</ENAMEX> in claims made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Health Care Finance Administration</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">HEI</ENAMEX> , which owned the hospital in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sullivan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mo.</ENAMEX> , during most of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the four - year period</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1983 - 1987</ENAMEX> -- covered in the amendment .
In a separate development , a private meeting is scheduled <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Whitten</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miss .</ENAMEX> -RRB- and Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Bumpers</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ark .</ENAMEX> -RRB- in an effort to end a dispute which for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</ENAMEX> has delayed action on an <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">estimated $ 44 billion</ENAMEX> agriculture bill .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - Senate conference reached agreement <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 5</ENAMEX> on virtually all major provisions of the bill , but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> men over the fate of a modest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> - based program to provide technical information to farmers seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides .
The program 's nonprofit sponsors received $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">900,000</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1989</ENAMEX> through an Extension Service grant , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitten</ENAMEX> has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">79 - year - old</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Mississippian</ENAMEX> takes a more orthodox , entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement to reduce chemical use , but as a master of pork - barrel politics , he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> center near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Memphis</ENAMEX> and the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> border .
