This is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The World</ENAMEX> , a co-production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the BBC World Service</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PRI</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WGBH</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> .
I am <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Mullins</ENAMEX> .
A plan was announced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> to raise the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> nuclear submarine ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kursk</ENAMEX> ' , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next summer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">almost a year</ENAMEX> after it hit the bottom of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Barents Sea</ENAMEX> following a mysterious accident .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Kursk Foundation</ENAMEX> , an international consortium led by the governments of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Netherlands</ENAMEX> says it can do the job safely if it can secure the funding .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Rogers</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brussels</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's announcement .
He says there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> main reasons for raising the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kursk</ENAMEX> .
Obviously the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> one is to recover the bodies that remain .
There are still the bodies of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</ENAMEX> sailors trapped in the vessel since it sank in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Barents Sea</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August of last year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</ENAMEX> , there is a longer - term threat and that 's an environmental threat .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Kursk Foundation</ENAMEX> says that the nuclear reactors , there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> on board , are safe for the time being but that the corrosive effects of seawater could in time lead to radioactive leaks into the ocean , which obviously could have devastating consequences on the fishery and the environment in general .
That 's the danger of leaving it down there .
I would think there are risks of bringing it up as well .
I mean this is a huge submarine .
That 's right .
The size of these things is really very surprising .
In fact <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> nuclear submarines is about the length of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and a half</ENAMEX> football fields .
Now , it 's lying in something <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 300 feet</ENAMEX> of water , so if you can just visualize it being turned on its end , it would stick out of the sea <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 200 feet</ENAMEX> .
It is a huge submarine and nobody is pretending that this , if it goes ahead , is going to be an easy operation .
There are any number of complications , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of which is that as part of the submarine is stuck in sand and clay on the seabed , so that 's going to give resistance once they do try to lift it .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</ENAMEX> problem , as I have already mentioned , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> nuclear reactors on board .
They are not going to be able to attach any lifting gear to any parts of the vessel nearby the nuclear reactors for fear of provoking an accident , so it is going to be extremely difficult .
We had heard <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months ago</ENAMEX> about some theories on how the submarine could be raised .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of them was using balloons .
Is that what the foundation itself plans on doing ?
That 's not what they are proposing .
Their rescue attempt involves <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> vessels essentially .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> is a diving ship with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> diving bells .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> is a huge platform with very large cranes on it , perhaps a platform of the type more usually used for oil and gas exploration , and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> vessel involved is what the rescuers describe as a giant offshore barge and the plan is to lift the submarine off the seabed , attach it to the underneath of this barge and then take it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> naval port of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mamansk</ENAMEX> .
How much is it going to cost and where is the money coming from ?
Well , that 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the problems that they are facing so far .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Kursk Foundation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> were mentioning a figure of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">70 million dollars</ENAMEX> .
They have already presented their rescue plans to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Union</ENAMEX> .
They are hoping to get some funding from them , but they are going to be looking for worldwide funding because as they see it , the potential environmental consequences make this an international problem requiring an international solution .
It might be worth reiterating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kursk</ENAMEX> was such a prestigious submarine and really held a high position in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Russian Navy</ENAMEX> , so this is something that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> themselves are still dealing with even now .
Very much so because obviously we have read a lot in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</ENAMEX> about how many parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> naval fleet is essentially rotting and is poorly maintained .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kursk</ENAMEX> certainly was n't part of that .
It was only launched in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</ENAMEX> and to a great extent was the pride of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> submarine fleet , so it was a great sense of shock when this went down .
It was also for men in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Russian Navy</ENAMEX> it was a great source of pride to serve in the submarine fleet , and then of course you have the feelings of the relatives to take into account .
There are still <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</ENAMEX> bodies which have n't been recovered , so at least raising the vessel and being able to return the bodies of the dead sailors to their loved ones might go some small way towards redressing their grief .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Rogers</ENAMEX> speaking to us from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brussels</ENAMEX> .
Thank you for the update <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> .
Thanks very much .
My pleasure .
