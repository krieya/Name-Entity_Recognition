In <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the long , frightening night</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> 's devastating earthquake , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Bay Area</ENAMEX> residents searched for comfort and solace wherever they could .
Some found it on the screen of a personal computer .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Californians</ENAMEX> made their way to their computers after the quake , and checked in with each other on electronic bulletin boards , which link computers CB - radio - style , via phone lines .
Some of the most vivid bulletins came over <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Well</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sausalito</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , board that is one of the liveliest outposts of the electronic underground .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About two - thirds</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Well</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</ENAMEX> subscribers live in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Bay Area</ENAMEX> .
The quake knocked <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Well</ENAMEX> out for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</ENAMEX> , but when it came back up , it teemed with emotional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> - hand reports .
Following are excerpts from the electronic traffic that <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> .
The time is <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Pacific Daylight Time</ENAMEX> , and the initials or nicknames are those subscribers use to identify themselves .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">11:54 p.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JCKC</ENAMEX> :
Wow !
I was in the avenues , on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> floor of an old building , and except for my heart -LRB- Beat , BEAT ! -RRB- I 'm OK .
Got back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolinas</ENAMEX> , and everything had fallen : broken poster frames with glass on the floor , file cabinets open or dumped onto the floor .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">11:59 p.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JKD</ENAMEX> :
I was in my favorite watering hole , waiting for the game to start .
I felt the temblor begin and glanced at the table next to mine , smiled that guilty smile and we both mouthed the words , `` Earth - quake ! '' together .
That 's usually how long it takes for the temblors to pass .
This time , it just got stronger and then the building started shaking violently up and down as though it were a child 's toy block that was being tossed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">12:06 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HRH</ENAMEX> :
I was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Berkeley Main</ENAMEX> library when it hit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Endless seconds</ENAMEX> wondering if those huge windows would buckle and shower us with glass .
Only a few books fell in the reading room .
Then the auto paint shop fire sent an evil - looking cloud of black smoke into the air .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">12:07 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ONEZIE</ENAMEX> :
My younger daughter and I are fine .
This building shook like hell and it kept getting stronger .
Except for the gas tank at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hustead 's Towing Service</ENAMEX> exploding and burning in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX> , things here are quite peaceful .
A lot of car alarms went off .
The cats are fine , although nervous .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">12:15 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DHAWK</ENAMEX> :
Huge fire from broken gas main in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Marina</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX> .
Areas that are made of ` fill ' liquefy .
A woman in a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three - story</ENAMEX> apartment was able to walk out the window of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> floor onto street level after the quake .
The house just settled right down into the ground .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">12:38 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAYAC</ENAMEX> :
I was driving my truck , stopped at a red light at the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shattuck</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Alcatraz</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> - Berkeley border when it hit .
Worst part was watching power lines waving above my head and no way to drive away .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">12:48 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LMEYER</ENAMEX> :
Was <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 ft.</ENAMEX> out on a pier in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Rafael</ENAMEX> .
It flopped all around , real dramatic !
Many hairline cracks in the concrete slabs afterwards .
Ruined the damn fishing !
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">1:00 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HEYNOW</ENAMEX> :
I rode it out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> floor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Leo 's</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">55th</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Telegraph</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> .
I heard parts of the building above my head cracking .
I actually thought that I might die .
I could n't decide if I should come home to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marin</ENAMEX> , because my house is on stilts .
I decided to brave the storm .
There was a horrible smell of gas as I passed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chevron</ENAMEX> refinery before crossing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Richmond - San Rafael Bridge</ENAMEX> .
I could also see the clouds across the bay from the horrible fire in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Marina District</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
I have felt many aftershocks .
My back is still in knots and my hands are still shaking .
I think a few of the aftershocks might just be my body shaking .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">1:11 a.m.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GR8FLRED</ENAMEX> :
I could see the flames from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> from my house across the bay .
It 's hard to believe this really is happening .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">1:11 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX> :
Building on the corner severely damaged , so an old lady and her very old mother are in the guest room .
Books and software everywhere .
This being typed in a standing position .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">1:20 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DGAULT</ENAMEX> :
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolinas</ENAMEX> -- astride <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the San Andreas Fault</ENAMEX> .
Did n't feel a thing , but noticed some strange bird behavior .
Duck swarms .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">3:25 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAMURAI</ENAMEX> :
I just felt another aftershock <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a few seconds ago</ENAMEX> .
I 'm just numb .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">3:25 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MACPOST</ENAMEX> :
Downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolinas</ENAMEX> seems to be the part of town that 's worst off .
No power , minimal phones , and a mess of mayonnaise , wine , and everything else all over the floors of the big old general store and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the People 's Co-op</ENAMEX> .
The quivers move through my house <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">every few minutes</ENAMEX> at unpredictable intervals , and the mouse that 's been living in my kitchen has taken refuge under my desk .
It runs out frantically now and then , and is clearly pretty distressed .
I was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stinson Beach</ENAMEX> when the quake rolled through town .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> , we were unfazed .
Then as things got rougher , we ran for the door and spent <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the next few minutes</ENAMEX> outside watching the brick sidewalk under our feet oozing up and down , and the flowers waving in an eerie rhythm .
Amazing what it does to one 's heart rate and one 's short - term memory .
Everyone looked calm , but there was this surreal low level of confusion as the aftershocks continued .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">4:02 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SHIBUMI</ENAMEX> :
Power is back on , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UCSF</ENAMEX> -LCB- medical center -RCB- seems to have quieted down for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</ENAMEX> -LRB- they were doing triage out in the parking lot from the sound and lights of it -RRB- .
A friend of mine was in an underground computer center in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX> when the quake hit .
He said that one of the computers took a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three - foot</ENAMEX> trip sliding across the floor .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> should be interesting as people realize how hard life is going to be here for a while .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">4:30 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">KIM</ENAMEX> :
I got home , let the dogs into the house and noticed some sounds above my head , as if someone were walking on the roof , or upstairs .
Then I noticed the car was bouncing up and down as if someone were jumping on it .
I realized what was happening and screamed into the house for the dogs .
Cupboard doors were flying , the trash can in the kitchen walked <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few feet</ENAMEX> , the dogs came running , and I scooted them into the dog run and stood in the doorway myself , watching the outside trash cans dance across the concrete .
When I realized it was over , I went and stood out in front of the house , waiting and praying for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merrill</ENAMEX> to come home , shivering as if it were <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 below zero</ENAMEX> until he got there .
Never in my life have I been so frightened .
When I saw the pictures of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">880</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> , I began to cry .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">5:09 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JROE</ENAMEX> :
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">The Sunset -LCB- District -RCB-</ENAMEX> was more or less like a pajama party <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">all evening</ENAMEX> , lots of people -AMP- dogs walking around , drinking beer .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">6:50 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAROLG</ENAMEX> :
I was just sitting down to meet with some new therapy clients , a couple , and the building started shaking like crazy .
It 's a flimsy structure , built up on supports , and it was really rocking around .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> of us stopped breathing for a moment , and then when it kept on coming we lunged for the doorway .
Needless to say , it was an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> session !
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">7:13 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CALLIOPE</ENAMEX> :
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albany</ENAMEX> escaped embarrassingly unscathed .
Biggest trouble was scared family who could n't get a phone line through , and spent <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a really horrible hour</ENAMEX> not knowing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">8:01 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HLR</ENAMEX> :
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy</ENAMEX> and I were in our back yard when the lawn started rolling like ocean waves .
We ran into the house to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mame</ENAMEX> , but the next tremor threw me in the air and bounced me as I tried to get to my feet .
We are all fine here , although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mame</ENAMEX> was extremely freaked .
Kitchen full of broken crystal .
Books and tapes all over my room .
Not <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing in the house is where it is supposed to be , but the structure is fine .
While I was standing on the lawn with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mame</ENAMEX> , waiting for another tremor , I noticed that all the earthworms were emerging from the ground and slithering across the lawn !
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">9:31 a.m.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GR8FLRED</ENAMEX> :
It 's amazing how <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">one second</ENAMEX> can so completely change your life .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">9:38 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FIG</ENAMEX> :
I guess we 're all living very tentatively here , waiting for the expected but dreaded aftershock .
It 's hard to accept that it 's over and only took <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">15 seconds</ENAMEX> .
I wonder when we 'll be able to relax .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">9:53 a.m .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PANDA</ENAMEX> :
Flesh goes to total alert for flight or fight .
Nausea seems a commonplace symptom .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX> very quiet right now .
I walked along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shattuck</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Delaware</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cedar</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes before eight this morning</ENAMEX> .
Next to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chez Panisse</ENAMEX> a homeless couple , bundled into a blue sleeping bag , sat up , said , `` Good <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> '' and then the woman smiled , said , `` Is n't it great just to be alive ? ''
I agreed .
It is .
Great .
