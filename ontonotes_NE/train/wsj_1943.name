<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Tennessee Valley Authority</ENAMEX> issued <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</ENAMEX> in bonds in the federal utility 's first public debt offering in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</ENAMEX> .
Proceeds from the bonds , with coupon rates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> range , will be used to replace bonds with an average interest rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.1 %</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVA</ENAMEX> said the refinancing should save <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 million</ENAMEX> a year in interest payments .
The refinancing is part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVA</ENAMEX> 's strategy of dealing with what has been an intractable problem : its staggering <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18.5 billion</ENAMEX> debt , most of which is owed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Treasury Department 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Financing Bank</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVA</ENAMEX> currently plans to issue a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.7 billion</ENAMEX> in bonds to refinance its high - interest debt .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</ENAMEX> bond issue also will help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVA</ENAMEX> meet its goal of not raising rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">another year</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William F. Malec</ENAMEX> , the agency 's chief financial officer .
The bond issue is TVA 's first public offering since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Financing Bank</ENAMEX> was created in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</ENAMEX> , primarily to finance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVA</ENAMEX> .
But the offering almost did n't happen .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVA</ENAMEX> , in fact , decided to proceed with the bond offering following an agreement <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Financing Bank</ENAMEX> , which allows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVA</ENAMEX> to keep borrowing short term from the bank for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> after it goes to the public market .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> contended that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TVA</ENAMEX> could n't borrow from both it and the public debt market .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</ENAMEX> in bonds break down as follows : <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year</ENAMEX> bonds with a coupon rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.25 %</ENAMEX> and a yield to maturity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.33 %</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> bonds with a coupon rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.375 %</ENAMEX> and a yield to maturity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.42 %</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bonds with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year</ENAMEX> call protection , a coupon rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.75 %</ENAMEX> and a yield to maturity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.06 %</ENAMEX> .
