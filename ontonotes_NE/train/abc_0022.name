The government said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> it 's going to cut back on the enormous number of people who descended on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> to investigate the attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole</ENAMEX> . ''
So many people from several agencies wanting to participate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemenis</ENAMEX> are feeling somewhat overwhelmed in their own country .
Investigators have come up with another theory on how the terrorists operated .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Miller</ENAMEX> on the house with a view .
High on a hillside , in a run - down section of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> , the house with the blue door has a perfect view of the harbor .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> investigators believe that view is what convinced a man who used the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> to rent the house <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks before</ENAMEX> the bombing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole</ENAMEX> . ''
Early on investigators theorized it was an inside job and much of the focus was on employees of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mansoon</ENAMEX> shipping company , which was under contract by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> to refuel <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> warships and would have had advance information about the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> 's '' arrival .
Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> believes all the terrorists needed to do was look out the window , to go through precisely the same drill , well before the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> '' arrived .
The man in this house would have had plenty of time to signal <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> bombers waiting with the boat across the bay .
Investigators say clues collected over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few days</ENAMEX> have already pointed them to locations both near and far outside the port city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> , but they wo n't say there 's any indication that the plot here goes beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> 's boarders .
Learning the true identities of those involved in the bombing would help answer that question , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> suicide bombers died in the attack , and after the explosion , the man who lived behind the blue door simply vanished .
