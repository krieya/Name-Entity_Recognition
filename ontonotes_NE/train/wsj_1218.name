Genetic Defect Spotted In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">3 - Day - Old</ENAMEX> Embryo
RESEARCHERS diagnosed a genetic defect in a three - day - old mouse embryo in an experiment directly applicable to humans .
Prenatal diagnosis of genetic defects <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as the sixth week</ENAMEX> of pregnancy is increasingly common <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
But the mouse experiment at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Medical Research Council</ENAMEX> laboratory in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> shows genetic defects can be detected <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</ENAMEX> after conception using a new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> - developed gene - copying technique .
The experiment , applicable to many genetic disorders , involved beta - thalassemia , a severe blood anemia resulting from a missing hemoglobin gene .
It 's an inherited human disorder that 's been duplicated in mice .
In the experiment , mice with the defective gene were mated .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Three days later</ENAMEX> , before the new embryo had become implanted in the uterus , it was washed out of the mother mouse .
The embryo had progressed only to a clump of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> identical cells .
One cell was teased out , and its DNA extracted .
Using the new technique developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cetus Corp.</ENAMEX> , called the polymerase chain reaction , the scientists rapidly made <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</ENAMEX> of copies of the section of DNA that ordinarily contains the hemoglobin gene , providing enough copies to test .
A genetic probe showed the hemoglobin gene was missing , the researchers report in the medical journal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lancet</ENAMEX> .
In the report , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> molecular biologists suggest such embryo diagnosis can be used by couples at high risk of passing a genetic defect to a child .
For example , infertile couples who have the woman 's eggs fertilized in the test tube usually have several eggs fertilized at a time .
When the fertilized cells divide to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> cells , a single cell from each embryo can be tested for genetic defects .
A healthy embryo can be picked for implantation and defective <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ones</ENAMEX> discarded .
Or in other couples , the embryo could be temporarily taken out and tested <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</ENAMEX> after conception and returned if healthy , or discarded if not .
Yeast Adapted to Make Gene - Spliced Drugs
AN OIL COMPANY finds a sideline in the microscopic world of yeast .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1970s</ENAMEX> , when the `` world food crisis '' was a major worry , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Phillips Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX> , like several other big companies , began developing `` single - cell protein , '' edible protein made by microbes feeding on non-edible materials .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Phillips</ENAMEX> found and improved a yeast , `` Pichia pastoris , '' which made protein from natural gas - derived alcohol .
It also could convert glucose from farm wastes into edible protein .
Single - cell protein never panned out , and most companies abandoned such research .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Phillips</ENAMEX> persisted , calling in scientists from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Salk Institute</ENAMEX> .
They 've now adapted the yeast to making genetically engineered drugs .
Like the bacteria used by genetic engineers , the yeast can take in human genes and churn out human proteins for medical use .
But the yeast genetic apparatus is more like that of animals than the bacterial genetic apparatus .
Thus , the proteins from the yeast are molecularly more like human proteins than those from bacteria .
The oil company claims its yeast system also is better than bacteria at high - volume production of genetically engineered drugs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chiron Corp.</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Emeryville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , biotechnology firm , is seeing if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Phillips</ENAMEX> yeast can be used to make its genetically engineered human proteins .
Peeking Inside Arteries From Outside the Body
VISUALIZING BLOOD vessels without poking catheters into the body may come out of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T Bell Laboratories</ENAMEX> .
Strokes , heart attacks , leg pains -LRB- intermittent claudication -RRB- and other problems stem from clogging of the arteries by cholesterol - rich deposits .
At present , doctors can see how badly an artery is clogged only by inserting a thin catheter into the artery and injecting a fluid that makes the arteries visible on X-rays .
A non-invasive method is being researched by biophysicist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynn Jelinski</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> unit .
It relies on the fact that certain atoms give off detectable signals when subjected to an intense magnetic field .
It 's the same phenomenon used in the new MRI -LRB- magnetic resonance imaging -RRB- scanners being used in hospitals in place of X-ray scans .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bell Labs</ENAMEX> experiments , an MRI - type of machine , synchronized with the heartbeat via an electrocardiogram , rapidly flashes a magnetic field on and off as blood passes a certain point in a vessel .
The rapidly flashing return signals from excited hydrogen atoms in the blood give a `` stop - motion '' movie of the blood - filled vessel , -LRB- like the `` stop - motion '' seen in disco dancers when a strobe light is flashing -RRB- .
The scientists have experimented on the tiny neck arteries of rats .
They 've been able to measure the minuscule movements of the artery wall as the beating heart raises and lowers the pressure of the flowing blood , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> for such tiny blood vessels , they report in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nature</ENAMEX> , a scientific journal .
They now are experimenting with measuring blood flow .
The ultimate hope is that the technique could identify diseased vessels .
Odds and Ends
TESTS ON <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2,800 - year - old</ENAMEX> mummies from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chile</ENAMEX> indicate ancient wood fires did n't produce dioxins or dibenzofurans , contradicting a theory the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> pollutants <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> are coming from wood burning , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> reports in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Environmental Science -AMP- Technology</ENAMEX> magazine ... .
Almost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> of schizophrenic men have an impaired sense of smell vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fewer than 10 %</ENAMEX> of schizophrenic women , reports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the American Journal of Psychiatry</ENAMEX> .
