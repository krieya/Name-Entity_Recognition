Several of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange 's</ENAMEX> own listed companies , led by giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Contel Corp.</ENAMEX> , are joining for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time to complain about program trading and the exchange 's role in it .
Claiming program trading has turned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> into a `` gambling casino , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Contel</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Wohlstetter</ENAMEX> said that he and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 20</ENAMEX> other corporate executives are forming an unprecedented alliance .
The group , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wohlstetter</ENAMEX> said in an interview , wants to end the market 's wild price swings that critics blame on computer - aided program - trading strategies .
The group will complain to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , to the heads of program - trading firms and to the heads of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> itself , he said .
`` They should call -LCB- the exchange -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trump East</ENAMEX> , '' charged Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wohlstetter</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">79 - year - old</ENAMEX> founder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Contel</ENAMEX> who 's also a former investment banker and stock trader .
`` What is the mission of the financial community --
to help some scavengers or schemers , or help corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> ? ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Contel</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion</ENAMEX> telephone and electronics company .
Pressure has been building on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two weeks</ENAMEX> to do something about market volatility , which many investors say is caused by program trading .
The market 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday - the - 13th</ENAMEX> plunge of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</ENAMEX> points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board 's</ENAMEX> understated response to it , galvanized some longstanding dissatisfaction among companies listed on the exchange .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</ENAMEX> , program trading accounted for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a record 13.8 %</ENAMEX> of average <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> volume .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wohlstetter</ENAMEX> , for example , said he wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Phelan Jr.</ENAMEX> about program trading after the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</ENAMEX> - point <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow</ENAMEX> plunge , and as in previous queries , `` what I get back is gobbledygook . ''
He said he 's upset that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> , trying to calm investors after the plunge , said that investors would simply have to get used to the market 's big price swings .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Big Board</ENAMEX> `` is partly to blame -LCB- for the price swings -RCB- , because they 're cowards , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wohlstetter</ENAMEX> .
`` Their powerful members manage them . ''
The focus of the outcry has been stock - index arbitrage , which accounts for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</ENAMEX> the program trading that goes on .
Index arbitragers argue that their trading is healthy because it links markets , but critics say such trading accelerates market movements and increases the chance for a crash .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Big Board</ENAMEX> has refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Grasso</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> president , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> said only that the exchange is concerned about all its constituents .
Privately , exchange officials worry that without a hospitable system for program trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</ENAMEX> in trading will simply migrate to overseas exchanges such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> 's .
It is partly for this reason that the exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> began trading in its own stock `` basket '' product that allows big investors to buy or sell all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> stocks in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Standard -AMP- Poor 's</ENAMEX> index in a single trade .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> intended customer of the new basket product is index arbitragers , according to the exchange .
Investors have complained for some time about program trading , particularly index arbitrage , to little avail .
But according to some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> traders , an organized campaign from exchange - listed companies might make the exchange finally consider big changes .
`` They wo n't fight the listed companies .
Now the assault is on , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> top trader .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Big Board</ENAMEX> ca n't ban stock - index futures , of course , but it could ban use of its high - speed electronic trading system for program trading or at least encourage securities firms to back off .
The exchange put a bit of a damper on program trading when , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , it simply started to publish <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> statistics of each firm 's program - trading volume .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Contel</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wohlstetter</ENAMEX> said the group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> companies is n't ready to go public yet with its effort , and that he does n't plan to be the leader once it is public .
However , he said he planned to spend <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</ENAMEX> making calls to gather additional support .
Among those Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wohlstetter</ENAMEX> said he has been talking to are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford Weill</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Primerica Corp.</ENAMEX> , which is the parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Smith Barney , Harris Upham -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GTE Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Johnson</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ITT Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rand Araskog</ENAMEX> .
None of these chief executives were available for comment .
Among the targets of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> companies ' campaign will be some corporate pension funds that use program - trading strategies to maximize returns on their investments .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Contel</ENAMEX> 's part , the company <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a month ago</ENAMEX> informed each of its money managers that it would drop them if they give business to program - trading firms .
It was just those kinds of ultimatums that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> succeeded in turning up the heat in the debate .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kemper Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kemper Financial Services</ENAMEX> unit said it cut off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Oppenheimer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Electric Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder , Peabody -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> unit .
All of the firms except <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder</ENAMEX> , which is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> - biggest program trader on Wall Street , quickly announced pull - backs from index arbitrage .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder</ENAMEX> officials stand by their aggressive use of program trading .
Chief Executive Officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Carpenter</ENAMEX> said that despite the outcry even by some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's own brokers , he believes index arbitrage does n't have a `` negative impact on the market as a whole .
'' However , pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's parent , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> , could change <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's policy .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Welch</ENAMEX> has been `` besieged with phone calls '' complaining about his unit 's program trading , according to a person close to him .
