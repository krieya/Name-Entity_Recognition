-LRB- During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">its centennial year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past century</ENAMEX> that stand as milestones of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> business history . -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LUTHER BURBANK</ENAMEX> CROSS - BRED PLANTS to produce the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion - dollar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> potato .
Bioengineers set out to duplicate that feat -- scientifically and commercially -- with new life forms .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Watson</ENAMEX> and his colleagues unlocked the double helix of DNA -LRB- deoxyribonucleic acid -RRB- , the genetic key to heredity .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty years later</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> academics , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Cohen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Boyer</ENAMEX> , made `` recombinant '' DNA , transplanting a toad 's gene into bacteria , which then reproduced toad genes .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyer</ENAMEX> met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Swanson</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">M.I.T.</ENAMEX> - trained chemist - turned - entrepreneur in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</ENAMEX> , they saw dollar signs .
With $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">500</ENAMEX> apiece and an injection of outside capital , they formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Genentech Inc</ENAMEX> .
Commercial gene - splicing was born .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Genentech</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> product , a brain protein called somatostatin , proved its technology .
The next to be cloned , human insulin , had market potential and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Genentech</ENAMEX> licensed it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eli Lilly</ENAMEX> , which produced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</ENAMEX> of the insulin used by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> diabetics .
Their laboratory credentials established , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swanson</ENAMEX> headed for Wall Street in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> .
At the time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Genentech</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only one profitable year</ENAMEX> behind it -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a modest $ 116,000</ENAMEX> on revenue of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.6 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</ENAMEX> -RRB- and no product of its own on the market .
Nonetheless , the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 36 million</ENAMEX> issue they floated in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> opened at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">35</ENAMEX> and leaped to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">89</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</ENAMEX> .
The trip from the test tube was not without snags .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> , for instance , both still university researchers , had to be talked into applying for a patent on their gene - splicing technique -- and then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Patent Office</ENAMEX> refused to grant it .
That judgment , in turn , was reversed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> , leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyer</ENAMEX> holding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> patents for making recombinant DNA -LRB- now assigned to their schools -RRB- .
Gene - splicing now is an integral part of the drug business .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Genentech</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> sales were <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 335 million</ENAMEX> , both from licensing and its own products .
