And they still have just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> daughter ?
Yes
and I think that 's probably all because %um I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl</ENAMEX> feels like people like me overpopulate the world .
I have <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> sons now .
Really ?
yeah .
gosh
And

and you know Jas- %ah <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jasmine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX> are taking swimming classes with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston</ENAMEX>
and I was oh , are they ? yeah , and I was thinking of asking him for your address
and I thought no he 's so forgetful
he 'll never remember .
It 's not worth it
Well he he never would
or he he he would n't know how to you know he would n't know how to get it .
I I used to call him .
Well , just just <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston</ENAMEX>
I know
you know ?
I used to call him every once in a while
but their niece like she 's I think she 's the oldest of all the Really ? uh-huh of all the kids the one whose I do n't know if you know much about the family but the one whose father got killed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> fighting
but anyway %um No . she was living in the house
and she 's kind of
I do n't know
all I know
I do n't know if she would 've been this way if she had n't had all the problems she had in her life
but she 's kind of a goofball
and she ran up such big bills that I do n't think they 've had a phone for a whole year because he ca n't pay them off
but and I do n't know if she 's still living there or not .
But I can give you my address
yeah
Wow
%huh
yeah
I 'd love I 'd %uh
yeah
I 'm so gla-
you know how I have your number ?
I s- I
I was wondering about that .
You talked to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dunya</ENAMEX>
No
no
well I did talk to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dunya</ENAMEX>
but she did n't give
well actually she was n't there the day I called
I talked to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph</ENAMEX>
but %um the last time I was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Honduras</ENAMEX> which is nearing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> . It 's going to be <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> . %um I saw your husband I was as I was leaving the airport
and i- I had my billfold out
and he wrote it on this little pad in my billfold
and you know what ?
I do n't have a lot of things
but I still have that
oh my gosh
and I do n't remember So I thought well I 'm going to advantage of it . So %ah and I do n't remember him telling me that he saw you .
oh he probably spaced it
he was I think he was in the middle of some kind of work project or something maybe where you
picking up people from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Peace Corps</ENAMEX> probably
yeah
Something like that
yeah
but that was right af-
I mean that 's a long time ago
that was right after the %um the change of the government .
We were down because of that .
%huh
So anyway
So three boys , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barb</ENAMEX> .
yeah .
Wow .
My hands are so full
yeah
I remember you said last time that the doctor said that you had to have a baby because of your your ovaries or whatever just to keep everything in order
Well if I wanted to have a child I should do it you know
and so that pushed me .
He said that we do n't want you to have a baby if it 's going to create problems
but if you want to have one this is the time
and it actually so you went all out oh that 's what it was did turn everything around for me .
I do n't know if it works that way for everybody
but those hormones kind of took care of the problems I was having .
I was starting to have the problem again befo-
like it was only <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">maybe three months afterwards</ENAMEX> I got pregnant
but I could already feel the pains and all that
so
Wow .
I wa- I felt so good when I was pregnant
I just felt like it was a miracle
and then
Really ?
oh yeah
and then breast feeding those hormones also helped
so I feel just fine .
I hope I hope I never have to deal with endometriosis again
but who knows after <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX>
So your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> boy is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noel</ENAMEX> ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noel</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noel</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noel</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noel</ENAMEX> .
And he 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven and a half</ENAMEX> .
That 's how long ago that was .
We probably uh-huh Seven and a half . We have n't seen each other s-
yeah
in a long time
uh-huh .
And your other two boys ?
Because a-
%um . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three</ENAMEX> .
uh-huh ?
It 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Enrique</ENAMEX> is his full name .
And then I have a baby who 's just going to turn <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten months</ENAMEX> .
oh really
And what 's the baby 's name ?
h- That 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Logan Andres</ENAMEX>
%ah .
oh how nice .
So are you going to keep going ? or
so
and you <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> girls
oh %ah well , I r- I t- I thought I was done really after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX>
not that I think <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> is the perfect number but I did n't expect to get pregnant a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> time
I it just kind of that happened when I was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Honduras</ENAMEX> last time
that was really so
mhm
i- I was so angry at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar</ENAMEX> that I just knew there was no way that I could ever even think of going to bed with him you know
So and that 's when it happened
but I love my little baby
and --
%huh
yeah
but
And you 're still with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar</ENAMEX> right
that 's
well we 're still married
but he 's doing his own thing like usual
so I pretty much take care of the crew all alone .
He calls to see how they 're doing and %huh pops in every once in a while ,
but it 's tough .
It really is
and see his daughter lives here too
wow
she 's kin-
She does ?
Well , she has since
well I think they 've been here five years now , five years this summer because we were figuring that they could apply for citizenship . Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehia</ENAMEX> %um .
He 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</ENAMEX>
and she 's just turned <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen</ENAMEX> now
Wow .
he does n't live here %um .
He had kind of ,
well , so it 's a long long story
but %um at one point when I got real irritated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar</ENAMEX> everybody in the family insisted that I was an idiot and I should make him take care of his children which you know I really believed when I was there
and I and i- I mean it does make a lot of intellectual sense , I guess .
But it really
I did n't want to do that to the kids
but I did
and so I sent them to stay with him
and then I felt bad about it immediately
and then he would n't let them come back
and so it turned into a situation where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehia</ENAMEX> was really the one that wanted to come back and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar</ENAMEX> junior kind of %um decided that living with his father was what he wanted
mhm
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehia</ENAMEX> 's mom used to beg him to let her come back
and he 'd say yes
and then he 'd hang up the phone
and he 'd say I 'd never let you go back there you know .
I mean it was real stupid .
It was n't really that he wanted her around
but it was just it
I do n't know .
People do stupid things .
%hm .
oh
%hm so they 're living with him ?
No ,
%um now how long ?
Probably two years ago then we she and I worked it out where I got power of attorney from her mom because her mom always had custody
and she called me one day when there was nobody in the house but her
and I drove and got her and kind of stole her back
it was kind of exciting
I could n't believe that I 'd ever do that
but oh well it was very exciting actually because oh my gosh I mean I had to drive like <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">two and half hours</ENAMEX>
so we you know you did n't know
at any moment somebody might be coming home .
I said get your stuff ready
and I called her when I got to the corner , you know ,
it was , it was really something
and we just packed the car full .
I mean there 's was n't one inch of space left
and then we just flew out of there ,
and we went to the nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonalds</ENAMEX> to kind of repack where we could breathe easy
oh my gosh .
It was pretty funny
and then you know he never said a thing about it .
yeah
he %hm . you know he 'd I know that he knew she was better off here
and she had told me that she almost committed suicide once
but you know he does n't even know any of it because it 's not that he does n't care about his kids but he 's not really capable of being a father .
You know he just .
%hm
close
So what 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehia</ENAMEX> doing ?
Is she studying
or did she already graduate high school ?
She 's going to be in her last year , of high school .
uh-huh .
And she 's been with her mom for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</ENAMEX>
so she 'll be coming back <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> . %um
%ah .
so it 's that 's that 's what we have here
and then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar</ENAMEX> junior has in the last year he was he graduated <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one year ago</ENAMEX> from high school
and he started going to school in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>
and then just out of the blue he told me that he and his buddy wanted to move back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omaha</ENAMEX> and go to school here which was really surprising and that he was kind of saying that it living with his father was n't what he you know , he kind of had
his opinion on it has had changed ,
but they wanted to live in an apartment .
They did n't want to burden me anymore were his words ,
but you know I know it 's that they want they want freedom , which is great .
They 're <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty</ENAMEX> you know .
%hm
yeah .
So they just moved in about oh <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> blocks well no maybe farther , about a mile from us
they live Wow . in an apartment
and that 's going to be really , I hope it 's going to be nice .
His buddy is here actually
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar</ENAMEX> is finishing some work that he was doing
and then he 's coming up sometime <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX>
yeah
but that that 's kind of in a nutshell all the things that have been going on
and
Wow
I
Well it 's interesting .
Are you working
or are you teaching ?
oh yes .
Well I do n't teach
%um I
yeah ?
let 's see ,
well I came back
I I taught adult basic education because it was really hard to get a job in home ec which is
it 's probably still that way
and I went for my masters in counseling
and uh-huh %um actually I was asked to come back and be the counselor at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> school
and that was the year I was pregnant with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noel</ENAMEX>
and I was really torn
I did n't know what to do
but my doctor did n't want me to go back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Honduras</ENAMEX> because I 'd been so sick before .
He felt that y-
mhm .
I really needed .
We did n't know how the pregnancy was going to go
but I I feel like
I really I mean I was n't really paying that much attention to what he said
but that did influence a little bit .
so I did n't go
%hm .
and %uh , let 's see ,
what would I ,
I guess I was working part time that year doing part time counseling jobs
and then <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that next year</ENAMEX> I had <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> o- well I had <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> offer that I had to take .
The other one was we were waiting for a principal to come back %um
mhm .
but I ended up .
I wanted to go into high school counseling
but I could n't because the principal was out on this boat they told me and he c- had to make the decision
it 's like oh I need th- I need this need to know fast because I 'm pregnant and I can not , you know , risk losing a job .
So I ended up working at the Sure . community college which was n't what I wanted at the time
but a- as it 's turned out it probably was the best %um
and I like it real well .
I l- I was cou- I counseled for about five years
and now I 'm in administration %um
oh great .
