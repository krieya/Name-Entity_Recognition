<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merksamer Jewelers Inc.</ENAMEX> , a fast - growing jewelry store chain , filed for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> bankruptcy - law protection from creditors , apparently to speed a management buy - out of the chain .
The filing , made <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Bankruptcy Court</ENAMEX> here , follows an agreement by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">L.J. Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merksamer 's</ENAMEX> owner , to sell the chain to management for an undisclosed price .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GE Capital Corp.</ENAMEX> , a financial services subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> , is providing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merksamer</ENAMEX> management with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</ENAMEX> in financing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> , filed for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> protection in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> and has also announced its intention to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">B. Altman -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> department store chain .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX> is owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> , which itself is currently being managed by a court - appointed provisional liquidator .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">L.J. Hooker 's</ENAMEX> planned sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merksamer</ENAMEX> is subject to approval by Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brozman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Bankruptcy Court</ENAMEX> .
Rumors to the effect that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merksamer</ENAMEX> chain would file for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> arose <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> in the jewelry industry .
At that time , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Merksamer</ENAMEX> , president of the chain , angrily denied that his company was about to file .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merksamer</ENAMEX> is leading the buy - out .
According to executives close to the situation , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merksamer</ENAMEX> filed for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> to speed the sale of the chain .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> executive said an accord signed by the unsecured creditors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">L.J. Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX> had frozen in place all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">L.J. Hooker 's</ENAMEX> assets .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merksamer</ENAMEX> bankruptcy - law filing appears to supersede that agreement .
`` By filing for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merksamer</ENAMEX> chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale , not the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of unsecured creditors , '' said this executive .
`` The cash from the sale will go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX> , but the company itself will belong to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Merksamer</ENAMEX> . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merksamer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford Sigoloff</ENAMEX> , chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX> , were unavailable for comment .
In a statement , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merksamer</ENAMEX> described the filing as a `` legal technicality , '' but also said that `` our inability to obtain trade credit , combined with a need to ensure that our stores were properly stocked for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the Christmas season</ENAMEX> , necessitated our filing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> . ''
The jewelry chain , which is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sacramento</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , had revenue of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 62 million</ENAMEX> and operating profit of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.5 million</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year ended June 30</ENAMEX> .
