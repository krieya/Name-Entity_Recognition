It has more drug users than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> has people .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thirty - four thousand</ENAMEX> of its children live in foster homes , while <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</ENAMEX> residents have no homes at all .
Its tax base is shrinking , a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> budget deficit looms , and the city faces contract negotiations with all major municipal unions <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
This is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> .
When the dust and dirt settle in an extra-nasty mayoral race , the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins</ENAMEX> .
Running the nation 's largest and most ornery city may be no treat , but at least Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> knows what to expect from it .
As the campaign hits the home stretch , however , voters still have very little idea what they can expect from him .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years</ENAMEX> in city politics , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins</ENAMEX> remains an enigma .
The soft - spoken , silver - haired <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> borough president -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> black man to win the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> nomination for mayor here -- does n't have a single prominent political enemy .
While he is widely described as a man with deep convictions , he has few major political programs that he can call his own .
Asked about his greatest achievement in public life , he <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> speaks about the quality of his staff .
Now , as <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">election day</ENAMEX> nears , even some supporters wonder what he will do if he wins the mayoralty on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 7</ENAMEX> .
They wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies , including union leaders and political cronies who may seek a place at the trough .
They wonder whether he has the economic know - how to steer the city through a possible fiscal crisis , and they wonder who will be advising him .
Will he , if he wins , be in the thrall of the most liberal of his allies , who advocate such policies as rent control for commercial buildings , or will he tilt toward the real - estate interests that have funneled money into his campaign ?
After his decisive primary victory over Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward I. Koch</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> coasted , until recently , on a quite - comfortable lead over his <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> opponent , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> , the former crime buster who has proved a something of a bust as a candidate .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> has stumbled in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two weeks</ENAMEX> over his campaign 's payments to a black activist who is a convicted kidnapper , and over his handling of a stock sale to his son .
Polls also have recorded some slippage in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's support among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> voters , and citywide projections now put his lead at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between four and 20</ENAMEX> percentage points .
In an interview with reporters and editors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the mayoralty .
`` A lot of people think I will give away the store , but I can assure you I will not , '' he says .
`` I am aware we have real budgetary problems . ''
The city is full of aging bridges , water mains and roadways that are in need of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</ENAMEX> worth of repair .
Renewed efforts to fight drugs and crime will be costly .
But city officials say tax revenues are lagging .
And after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</ENAMEX> of explosive job growth on Wall Street , a period of contraction is under way .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX> already has announced he will drop <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,200</ENAMEX> jobs from the city payroll , but that wo n't be enough .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York State</ENAMEX> Comptroller <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Regan</ENAMEX> predicts a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</ENAMEX> budget gap for the city 's next <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year</ENAMEX> , a gap that could grow if there is a recession .
If elected , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> will probably have no choice but to raise taxes on overburdened businesses or cut spending in already under - serviced neighborhoods .
`` He is going to face a mess , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">City Council</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Stein</ENAMEX> .
`` His supporters are not venal , but their solution to everything will be to spend more money , and he wo n't have any money . ''
By and large , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> has finessed the touchy question of whose ox he would gore .
Instead of focusing on the financial future , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> has sold himself as a unifier for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">12 years</ENAMEX> of commotion generated by Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX> .
`` The thing about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> candidacy is that it offers hope to a broad range of people , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyer Frucher</ENAMEX> , a real - estate executive and former aide to Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Cuomo</ENAMEX> .
`` It is a feel - good candidacy . ''
No doubt , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> has been a calming influence .
He is an avuncular figure who remembers the birthdays of colleagues ' children , opens doors for women , and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody .
More important , he emerged as a peacemaker <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Central Park</ENAMEX> rape of a white jogger -- in which a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Harlem</ENAMEX> teens was charged -- and the racial murder of a black teen - ager in the white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> neighborhood of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Bensonhurst</ENAMEX> .
Rather than scaring off white voters , as many predicted he would , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head .
-LRB- Keeping cool is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> priority : On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">humid days this summer</ENAMEX> , he was known to change his double - breasted suits <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as four</ENAMEX> times a day . -RRB-
But even in his front - runner campaign , he has shown signs of the indecisiveness and confusion that some say has plagued his tenure as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> borough president -- and might hinder him as mayor .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few weeks</ENAMEX> , he has frittered away <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly half</ENAMEX> of what was once a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</ENAMEX> - point lead in the polls over Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> .
A story about how he mishandled the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political patron <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Percy Sutton</ENAMEX> was allowed to fester <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a full week</ENAMEX> before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> faced the media .
He has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely inaccessible to the media until the stock story broke .
His campaign was caught flat - footed amid allegations it paid <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 10,000</ENAMEX> for what it said was a `` get - out - the - vote '' effort by black activist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonny Carson</ENAMEX> , a convicted kidnapper who later said publicly that he is `` anti-white . ''
Critics have said the payment looked like an attempt by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> camp to get Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carson</ENAMEX> to stop leading confrontational demonstrations protesting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Bensonhurst</ENAMEX> murder -- protests the campaign may have feared could cause some white voters to turn from a black candidate .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> also has failed to allay <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> voters ' fears about his association with the Rev. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Jackson</ENAMEX> , despite the fact that few local <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="4">non-Jewish</ENAMEX> politicians have been as vocal for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> causes in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 20 years</ENAMEX> as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> has .
These campaign problems have echoed difficulties Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> has run into before .
A former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S. Marine</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> got off to a quick start in politics , joining a local <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> political club in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</ENAMEX> , linking up with black urban leaders such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Rangel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basil Paterson</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> , and getting himself elected to the state assembly in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</ENAMEX> .
But his chance to become deputy mayor under Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham Beame</ENAMEX> , a plan boosted by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> , was squandered because of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's failure -- still largely unexplained -- to file income tax returns for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> running .
`` I always thought of this as a thing that could always be done <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> , '' he said at the time .
Later , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> became more deeply indebted to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> and other city pols , including then - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">City Council</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul O'Dwyer</ENAMEX> , when they helped him get appointed city clerk , a largely ceremonial post responsible for the city 's marriage bureau , among other things .
-LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Dwyer</ENAMEX> is now <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the lawyers for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> 's media company . -RRB-
The debt rose further in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</ENAMEX> when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> resigned his position as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> borough president to run for mayor .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> recalls : `` When I left , I sat down with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie -LCB- Rangel -RCB-</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basil -LCB- Paterson -RCB-</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> said , ` Who will run for borough president ? ' And I said , ` You will . ' ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Garth</ENAMEX> , Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX> 's longtime media adviser , says of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> , `` He really is the personification of the patronage system .
But the guy is so personally decent , people tend to forget that . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> lost twice by wide margins before finally getting elected borough president in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> .
But by most accounts , he made little of the post and was best known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Board of Estimate</ENAMEX> , the body that votes on crucial budget and land - use matters .
Colleagues <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> recall with some humor how meetings would crawl into <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the early morning hours</ENAMEX> as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss , en masse , certain controversial proposals .
`` He taught me how to drink herbal tea instead of coffee at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">3 a.m.</ENAMEX> , I 'll give him that , '' says Deputy Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Esnard</ENAMEX> .
Often , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's procrastination prevented him from having a say in the way things turned out , critics claim .
On the campaign stump , he often points out that he was the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Board of Estimate</ENAMEX> member to vote against a controversial real - estate project at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Columbus Circle</ENAMEX> .
But board members say he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided , it was too late to try to draw other members to his position .
Says <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> city official : `` Everybody else had brought in the wagons and made their deal .
He would have got a lot more done if he made up his mind faster . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Board</ENAMEX> member , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronx Borough</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand Ferrer</ENAMEX> , was said to be so impatient with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign .
`` I had some problem from time to time on the length of time he would take to make up his mind , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferrer</ENAMEX> admits , but he maintains that he did n't delay his support of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> and that he backs the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> candidate enthusiastically .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's campaign manager and former chief of staff , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Lynch</ENAMEX> , denies that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> borough president has taken too long to decide important issues .
`` We did n't rubber - stamp everything that came to us , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynch</ENAMEX> says .
On some occasions when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> has discussed the issues during the campaign , he has run into a familiar kind of trouble .
Some supporters were stunned <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</ENAMEX> when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> suggested weakening the law forbidding public employees to go on strike .
He withdrew the remark .
When he later sided with striking hospital workers , some allies cringed a little more , concerned that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> was setting the wrong tone for coming contract negotiations with city employees .
Then , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</ENAMEX> before receiving an endorsement from environmental groups , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> promised he would issue a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - year</ENAMEX> moratorium on construction of garbage - incinerator plants .
That announcement was roundly criticized by Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX> -- who has endorsed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> -- because the city faces a garbage crisis and has already spent <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million</ENAMEX> planning for an incinerator that would be scrapped under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's proposal .
While his public statements have at times been confusing , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's position papers have more consistently reflected anti-development sentiment .
He favors a form of commercial rent control , which the financial community believes would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city .
In the midst of a labor shortage , he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> residents .
With an untrained local labor pool , many experts believe , that policy could drive businesses from the city .
And he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> in the battle over companies thinking of moving employees out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> .
Many economic - development officials say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX> administration 's aggressive approach helped save <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chase Manhattan Bank</ENAMEX> jobs from moving across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Hudson</ENAMEX> .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's economic planks do n't seem to bother the business community , where he draws significant support .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Spinola</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Real Estate Board of New York</ENAMEX> , an industry organization , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's `` economic development program is shortsighted , but when it comes down to it , he can be reasonable . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's inner circle of advisers appears to include both ideologues and pragmatists , leaving voters with little clue as to who will be more influential .
The key man seems to be the campaign manager , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynch</ENAMEX> .
A disheveled , roly - poly son of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Island</ENAMEX> potato farmer , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynch</ENAMEX> is a veteran union organizer who worked on the presidential campaigns of Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kennedy</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> .
But as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> campaign hit tough times <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Cuomo</ENAMEX> , the politically seasoned son of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> governor , is also said to have taken a more active role on strategy .
Another close ally is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth Messinger</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> city councilwoman , some of whose programs , such as commercial rent control , have made their way into Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's position papers .
If she remains influential with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> , as some suggest she will , his mayoralty may take on a more anti-development flavor .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lincoln Center</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathan Leventhal</ENAMEX> , who would head a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> transition team , is more mainstream , as is real - estate executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Gliedman</ENAMEX> , another insider .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> also has said he would receive economic advice from a board that would include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express Co.</ENAMEX> chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James D. Robinson III</ENAMEX> , investment banker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felix Rohatyn</ENAMEX> , leveraged - buy - out specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reginald Lewis</ENAMEX> and attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Flom</ENAMEX> .
Some business leaders and others also believe that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy mayor with a strong administrative background .
Names of possible deputies that have surfaced include former mayoral candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Ravitch</ENAMEX> , former schools chancellor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Macchiarola</ENAMEX> and Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leventhal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gliedman</ENAMEX> .
Then there are Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's old - time <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Harlem</ENAMEX> colleagues , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rangel</ENAMEX> , former Deputy Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paterson</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> .
Having attained positions of real influence or wealth , these men constitute the Old Guard of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> black politics ; they are less confrontational than the younger , more activist black political community that has been based largely in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> .
-LRB- Part of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's strength is his ability to win the support of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Harlem</ENAMEX> factions . -RRB-
`` We know there are potholes for the city out there , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paterson</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's former law partner .
`` If any of us think we 're going to sidetrack <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> 's determination to be the best possible mayor because of his obligations to us , we are making a sad mistake . ''
Adds Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Messinger</ENAMEX> , who is expected to win the borough president 's job Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> is vacating , `` You have to remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> is a pragmatist . ''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's sense of pragmatism often comes across more as an insider 's determination not to upset the political apple cart .
He is taken aback in an interview when asked whether , as mayor , he plans on reforming the political `` fiefdoms '' that perpetuate the monumental ineffectiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York 's</ENAMEX> school system .
`` I will sit down and talk some of the problems out , but take on the political system ? Uh-uh , '' he says with a shake of the head .
Despite many doubts about his candidacy , white <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> -- who gave Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> of their votes in the primary -- are n't expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> .
The former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney , who prosecuted targets ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mafia</ENAMEX> dons to Wall Street executives , has succeeded in raising questions about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's ethical standards , but so far has failed to generate excitement about his own candidacy .
As a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> in an overwhelmingly <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> city , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> has an inherent handicap .
As a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> - time candidate , he has been slow to learn the nuances of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> politicking .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> is finding that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> , in his <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</ENAMEX> in public life , has built up considerable good will that so far has led many voters to overlook certain failings .
`` The bottom line is that he is a very genuine and decent guy , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Hoenlein</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> community leader .
`` In the end , I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> will be judged for being <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> .
