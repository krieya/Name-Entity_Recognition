In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> a campaign against fake goods has netted <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">43 million dollars</ENAMEX> of counterfeit products over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past month</ENAMEX> .
The trade in bogus goods is thought to cost companies <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of billions of dollars</ENAMEX> in lost revenues <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</ENAMEX> , but officials say enforcing the law is often dangerous with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</ENAMEX> government inspector killed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</ENAMEX> .
Officials say some corrupt local government officials are protecting the pirates .

Multinational companies investing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> had become so angry that they recently set up an anti-piracy league in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> to pressure the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> government to take action .
Domestic manufacturers , who are also suffering , launched a similar body <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> recently introduced a new law increasing fines against producers of fake goods from the amount of profit made to the value of the goods produced , but many observers say this is still not a sufficient deterrent .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> media have said that fake products are humiliating the nation and undermining public morality , and while the fakes are often so well packaged that even the real manufacturers ca n't tell the difference , the products inside are often downright dangerous .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> says it is determined to tackle the problem as part of its moves towards joining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the World Trade Organization</ENAMEX> .
