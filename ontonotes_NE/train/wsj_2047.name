The nations of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> know a lot about managing elephants ; their herds are thriving .
But the nations of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">North America</ENAMEX> have decided they know better .
At this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.N.</ENAMEX> conference in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lausanne</ENAMEX> , they imposed a global ivory ban that seeks to overturn local policies .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Zimbabwean</ENAMEX> delegate argued that the ban would `` guarantee the extinction of the elephant . ''
Legitimate ranchers , who have an interest in preserving the herds , would go out of business .
Poachers would control the underground trade .
Many delegates were willing to craft a compromise , but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> delegate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constance Harriman</ENAMEX> and others thundered that down .
The Greens from the First World wanted a morality play , not a negotiation .
Fortunately , the nations of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> have n't totally surrendered their sovereignty .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</ENAMEX> countries announced they would not honor what <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Zimbabwean</ENAMEX> delegate wryly called the `` made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX> '' solution .
In fact , they seemed a mite resentful .
The director of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zimbabwe</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wildlife Department</ENAMEX> described <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> conservationists as `` fat little puppies from urban environments who do n't know a thing about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> . ''
That 's not fair ; they 're not all fat .
