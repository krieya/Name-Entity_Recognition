<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Just five months</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy Group</ENAMEX> was swallowed up in an unsolicited takeover , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Roman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> 's chairman and chief executive officer , said he is leaving to take a top post at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express Co</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">59 years old</ENAMEX> , abruptly announced he will leave the venerable ad agency , whose largest client is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express</ENAMEX> , to become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express 's</ENAMEX> executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications .
He will succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry L. Freeman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">57</ENAMEX> , who has said he will retire in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeman</ENAMEX> said in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> that he would retire by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of this year</ENAMEX> to take `` executive responsibility '' for an embarrassing effort to discredit banker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmond Safra</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express</ENAMEX> representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safra</ENAMEX> .
The company later apologized and agreed to make <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 million</ENAMEX> in contributions to charities chosen by him .
Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeman</ENAMEX> is retiring , he will continue to work as a consultant for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express</ENAMEX> on a project basis .
Ad industry executives were n't surprised by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> 's decision to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> .
The agency , under his direction , bitterly fought a takeover attempt by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WPP Group PLC</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> before succumbing in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May</ENAMEX> .
And although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WPP</ENAMEX> 's chief executive , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Sorrell</ENAMEX> , have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other , people close to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> say he was unhappy giving up control of the company .
Some executives also cite tension because of efforts by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX> , a financial man , to cut costs at the agency .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> will be succeeded as the head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> 's flagship ad agency , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy -AMP- Mather Worldwide</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Phillips</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50</ENAMEX> , who had been president of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">North American</ENAMEX> operations and who , like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX> , is <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Brody</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">56</ENAMEX> , will take on the newly created position of president of the world - wide agency and chief executive of its international operations .
He had been president of the international operations .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> also had overseen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy Group 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> other units , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Scali McCabe Sloves</ENAMEX> advertising agency and its research division , but those units will now report directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WPP</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> appears custom - made for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express</ENAMEX> job .
Known as a traditional executive , he is very much in the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express</ENAMEX> mold .
Moreover , after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">26 years</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> he had honed a reputation for being squeaky - clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express</ENAMEX> in the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safra</ENAMEX> incident .
He also is close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express 's</ENAMEX> chairman and chief executive officer , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James D. Robinson III</ENAMEX> .
Aside from working with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express</ENAMEX> advertising account for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about 11 years</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> serves on several of the same charities and boards as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> .
The abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> had been pushed out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> 's top spot by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX> .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> flatly denied the speculation , saying Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX> had tried several times to persuade him to stay , offering various incentives and in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> instance sending a note with a case of wine -LRB- The wine , naturally , was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Seagram</ENAMEX> 's brand , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> client -RRB- .
`` He asked me not to resign .
The implication that I was pushed aside would n't be accurate , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> said .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX> , traveling in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Far East</ENAMEX> , could n't be reached .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express 's</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> first approached him about the job in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late September</ENAMEX> .
According to industry executives , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Sutherland</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">European Community</ENAMEX> commissioner from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> , was also a serious contender for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express</ENAMEX> job .
Although it ultimately was n't offered to him , he will be on retainer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express</ENAMEX> as an adviser on international matters .
After talking on and off for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past four weeks</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> said , he agreed to take the job because `` it 's the right time , it 's a terrific opportunity , and I think I leave the company in very strong hands .
It was my decision , not anyone else 's . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> also brushed aside reports about infighting between him and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> , his successor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> executives could hardly be more different .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> comes across as a low - key executive ; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> has a flashier personality .
During time off , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> tends to his garden ; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> confesses to a fondness for , among other things , fast cars and planes .
Industry executives say that although the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> executives used to clash more frequently , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WPP</ENAMEX> takeover brought them closer together .
`` I 'm the guy who made him head of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">North America</ENAMEX> , and recommended him -LCB- to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX> -RCB- as my successor .
Would I have done all those things successively if I did n't think he was the right guy ? '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> asked .
He labeled reports of friction `` ridiculous , '' and said that he spent part of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</ENAMEX> on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> 's boat in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> will oversee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express 's</ENAMEX> public relations and government affairs , among other things , but he wo n't be involved in its advertising , which is handled by the operating units .
`` I consider this a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> career , '' he said .
He also will sit on the company 's corporate planning and policy committee , made up of the top corporate and operating executives .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> 's departure is n't expected to have any enormous repercussions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kraft General Foods</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mattel</ENAMEX> executives said the move wo n't affect their relationships with the ad agency .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Foods 's</ENAMEX> relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies ' work , and will continue to be , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hurwitt</ENAMEX> , a vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kraft General Foods</ENAMEX> .
But some clients and analysts expressed concern that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> is n't as well - known to many clients .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken</ENAMEX> was my key contact , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Nicholas Hahn</ENAMEX> , president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cotton Inc.</ENAMEX> , which represents cotton producers .
`` I do n't know -LCB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> -RCB- all that well .
I have n't seen or talked to him in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</ENAMEX> . ''
And some analysts questioned whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> would have the skills <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> needs to turn the agency around .
While the agency has done well in many parts of the world , its flagship <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> office has had a dismal track record recently ; it has won few new accounts while losing big ones , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Maxwell House</ENAMEX> .
`` I think -LCB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> -RCB- is going to need some help .
I think they need creative leadership , and I do n't think they have it , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emma Hill</ENAMEX> , an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wertheim -AMP- Co</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy -AMP- Mather 's</ENAMEX> top creative executive , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Berry</ENAMEX> , left the agency <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norm Berry</ENAMEX> was a creative inspiration at the company , and nobody has filled that void , '' said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> .
But other analysts said that having Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> succeed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> would make for a smooth transition .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Phillips</ENAMEX> has been there a long time , knows the culture well , is aggressive , and apparently gets along well with '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Wallach</ENAMEX> , an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's probably a reasonable transition .
Hopefully , he 'll be the answer to the problems they 've had in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> . ''
