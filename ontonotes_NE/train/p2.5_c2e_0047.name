" Zhu " means chopsticks .
Interestingly , the pronunciation of chopsticks " zhu " also means " stop , " which is very easy to understand , since we use chopsticks to pick up food .
It is just like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grandma Liu</ENAMEX> wanting to eat quail eggs .
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grandma Liu</ENAMEX> picked up the chopsticks , only felt that she could not master it , so she said , " The chickens here are so handsome , they also lay such small eggs , which are pretty handsome .
Let me try one . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">This Grandma Liu</ENAMEX> was really straightforward yet humorous . -RRB-
But another pronunciation " kuai " for chopstick just has the meaning of " quick , " which is just opposite in meaning with " stop " .
It was said that boatmen felt that " stop " was unlucky , so they gave it an opposite name and called it accordingly .
There is a proper way of setting up and laying down chopsticks : they must be of the same length ; if the length is uneven , it has the meaning of really bad luck .
People often use the expression " <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</ENAMEX> longs and <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</ENAMEX> shorts " to symbolize unpredictable changes ; for instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sister Feng</ENAMEX> once said : " Just as there could be unpredicted winds and clouds in the sky , people too can experience misfortunes and fortunes at any time .
At this little age , if I have any long or short because of this illness , then my time on earth would be meaningless ! "
The story goes that in ancient times there were no nails to seal coffins firmly , so after the lid was placed on a coffin , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</ENAMEX> horizontal boards and two vertical boards would be used to tie the coffin up tightly .
The horizontal boards are long while the vertical ones are short .
Hence when the expression " <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</ENAMEX> longs and <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</ENAMEX> shorts " is mentioned , people are reminded of the sad event of somebody 's death , which would move people to tears , and they would put down their chopsticks , as they do not feel like eating .
