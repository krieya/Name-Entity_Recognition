<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tieying Li</ENAMEX> , state council member and director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State Commission for System Reform</ENAMEX> , pointed out at <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the National Economic System Reform Work Conference</ENAMEX> convened here that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> would focus on hot issues and tough issues of current economic life and strive to make new breakthroughs in economic system reform .
He said that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year 's</ENAMEX> main tasks of economic system reform will be : maintaining the direction of the reform of the socialist market economy ; further adjusting and perfecting ownership structures ; accelerating the pace of creating a modern enterprise system for state - owned enterprises ; vigorously promoting strategic reform of the state owned economy ; accelerating restructuring ; appropriately placing departing extraneous personnel ; implementing re-employment projects ; deepening financial system reforms ; continuing to strengthen and improve macroscopic control ; promoting grain and cotton circulation system reform ; actively developing agriculture industrialization operations ; actively promoting organization reform ; transforming the government 's economic management methods ; examining the system of management , supervision , and operation of state - owned assets ; deepening reforms in the systems of social security and housing ; striving to improve urban integrated support reform ; and making substantial progress in setting up new systems .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tieying Li</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> the focus on deepening reform in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's state - owned enterprises is advancing as a whole and would use companies as its main units of operation to implement comprehensive system innovation for the goal of establishing a modern enterprise system .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> government recently pointed out that it would take <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about 3 years</ENAMEX> to extricate the majority of large and medium - sized state - owned enterprises with a deficit from their current plight through reforming , restructuring , renovating and strengthening management .
It would , by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of this century</ENAMEX> , endeavor to make the majority of large and medium - sized key state - owned backbone enterprises preliminarily establish modern enterprise systems .
Currently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Council</ENAMEX> is researching and laying down specific plans and policies for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">3 - year</ENAMEX> state - owned enterprise reform .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tieying Li</ENAMEX> pointed out that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> would actively promote the strategic restructuring of state - owned enterprises using the principle of " grasping the large ones and letting the little ones go " as a major premise .
When rebuilding state - owned enterprises into limited companies and stock companies with multiple principle investments and reasonable stock rights structure , and when using capital as the link for structuring parent - subsidiary corporate systems to smooth out reasonable internal group relations , we need to prevent administrative " mandatory matching " and " arbitrarily creating piles " .
The development of a number of large companies and large groups through purchase , merger and alliance that would combine industry , technology and trade and would operate across regions , across industries , across systems of ownership and across countries needs to be encouraged .
According to statistics , at present , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 300,000</ENAMEX> state - owned enterprises of which <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14,500</ENAMEX> are large and medium - sized enterprises .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the recent period</ENAMEX> , the momentum of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's state - owned enterprise reform has obviously increased , and inter-enterprise purchases , mergers and " powerful alliances " have reached a fixed scale .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tieying Li</ENAMEX> said that housing system reform needs to focus on establishing new mechanisms of benefit allotment monetization , and needs to accelerate the process of transforming housing allotments and tangibles to payments .
When talking about rural system reform , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tieying Li</ENAMEX> stressed that the household - factory contract responsibility system needs to persist unchanged for a long time , a system of land rights and compensated circulation needs to be actively sought and established and land scaled operations need to be promoted .
Through reform , a grain circulation system with a clear division of central and local responsibilities and rights which would be under national macroscopic control and would meet the needs of the socialist market economy and would suit the national situation needs to be gradually established .
Through implementing industrialized agricultural operations , peasants ' income and local fiscal revenues should be increased and new economic growth spots should be cultivated .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tieying Li</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> had the determination and confidence to reach the target of preliminarily establishing a socialist market economy system by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of this century</ENAMEX> .
Planned key breakthroughs should be made on some system factors that inhibit establishing new systems so as to accelerate realizing a new phase of resource deployment marketization , benefit allotment monetization , public service socialization , economic operation legalization , and initiating economic system reform .
