The prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> is keeping up its dizzying <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> buying binge of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> corn .
Those rumors were confirmed after the end of trading <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> announced that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> had bought <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.2 million metric tons</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> corn , bringing their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> corn purchases confirmed so far <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about five million metric tons</ENAMEX> .
In trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> , the corn contract for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> delivery jumped <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.75 cents</ENAMEX> a bushel to settle at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.44</ENAMEX> a bushel .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> purchases are close to exceeding what some analysts had expected <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</ENAMEX> in which it usually buys much of the corn it imports from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
That pace is causing some analysts to speculate that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> might soon purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as much as another two million metric tons</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> sign that more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> purchases are possible is that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> grain companies <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts .
That sometimes signals that they are laying plans to export corn .
By some estimates , several grain companies combined bought contracts for the possession of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly one million metric tons</ENAMEX> of corn .
By buying futures contracts , these companies attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are obligated to deliver .
Rumors of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> interest also pushed up the prices of soybean futures contracts .
Among other things , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> is widely thought to be mulling whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
On top of all this , corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Midwest</ENAMEX> harvest was disrupted by a freakishly early snow storm that dumped <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several inches</ENAMEX> in parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> .
The harvest delays , however , are expected to be temporary .
Balmy temperatures are forecast for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Lekberg</ENAMEX> , an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers Grain -AMP- Livestock Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
Many farmers used the jump in prices to sell their recently harvested crop to grain elevator companies .
The heavy selling by farmers helped to damp the price rally .
Wheat futures prices rose slightly .
In other commodity markets <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> :
PRECIOUS METALS :
Futures prices declined .
A number of developments were negatively interpreted by traders .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> delivery gold fell $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.80</ENAMEX> an ounce to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">370.60</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> silver eased <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.7 cents</ENAMEX> an ounce to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.133</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> platinum was down $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.60</ENAMEX> an ounce at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">491.10</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> price - depressing development was the lower - than - expected increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 0.2 %</ENAMEX> in the consumer price index for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , an analyst said .
He noted that the `` core inflation rate , '' which excludes food and energy , was also low at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</ENAMEX> .
Other news that weighed on the market : Initial unemployment claims rose by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Telephone -AMP- Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> will reduce its managerial staff by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</ENAMEX> through attrition ; the oil market turned weaker ; there was n't any investor demand for bullion ; and the dollar strengthened during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> , putting pressure on gold .
Also , the analyst said , economic circumstances are such that both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , the principal gold and platinum producers , are being forced to continue selling the metals .
Both are in great need of foreign exchange , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> is also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments , he said .
`` Putting it all together , we have a negative scenario that does n't look like it will improve <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
COPPER :
Futures prices recovered in quiet trading .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> contract rose <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.50 cents</ENAMEX> a pound to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.2795</ENAMEX> .
That contract fell a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.75 cents</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first three days</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> , mostly in reaction to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Friday 's</ENAMEX> stock market plunge , which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy and thus reduced demand for copper , a leading industrial metal .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent days</ENAMEX> , however , there has been increased purchasing of copper in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> , an analyst said .
Some of this buying was by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production stoppages at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bougainville</ENAMEX> mine in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papua New Guinea</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> mine in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cananea</ENAMEX> mine in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , which are major shippers to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
The increasing likelihood that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cananea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing , but even if any of these mines begin operating soon , their output wo n't be significant until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at least the end of the year</ENAMEX> , analysts note .
So , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> analyst said , even though the long - term production problems may be easing , there will still be a significant need for copper over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next three months</ENAMEX> , when inventories will remain relatively low .
ENERGY :
Crude oil prices ended mixed .
West Texas Intermediate for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> delivery fell <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">14 cents</ENAMEX> a barrel to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">20.42</ENAMEX> .
But so - called outer <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">month</ENAMEX> contracts finished higher .
For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> contracts for WTI rose <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">17 cents</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">20.42</ENAMEX> .
Most energy futures opened lower , following <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> 's market downturn .
But a flurry of late trading <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> beefed up prices .
Heating oil and gasoline futures ended higher as well .
