The move comes <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> is scheduled to hold confirmation hearings on President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> nominee <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Roberts</ENAMEX> /.
Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Dodd</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> was among those <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> who spoke out against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolton</ENAMEX> 's appointment <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> /.
I just do n't think he can do a very good job there /.
I think he 's going to hurt the president more importantly going to hurt the country /.
I think the nomination is a -- is a bad one /.
I think the wa- way he 's arriving there is a -- is a -- is a very bad idea /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Gregory</ENAMEX> is at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the White House</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> you know the president does n't he run the risk of looking like the little rich kid who is not winning the game so he says it 's my ball /.
I 'm going home with it /?
Well I have a theory about this <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> which is that every time somebody accuses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> about being abrasive or abusive to subordinates or you know difficult to work with as somebody who is just going to break all the china in the place the president says oh yeah this is why I like the guy /.
this is exactly what I want at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> /.
And I 'm -- I 'm only half kidding /.
I really think that that is a big part of this that the president uh yes he may be ruffling feathers here but he does n't mind if he -- to deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> the president wants to do it in a pretty hardline way /.
But it uh but does n't -- well let me ask you this about the nature of the appointment because he can only be appointed through uh the beginning of the next session of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> which is in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early oh seven</ENAMEX> it 's really <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only a year and a few months</ENAMEX> /.
how can he really be a permanent representative and have the stature of one /?
Well I think that 's a big question /.
Uh I me- It is a question that was posed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> secretary - general <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> /.
I mean the bottom line is that the president has got some time to work with him /.
He has <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</ENAMEX> up there /.
He knows he has got you know the president 's authority /.
Everybody up there in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> understands that as well that he can push the the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> agenda /.
And then we 'll see what happens /.
I mean if he can prove to some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> that uh he can work well with others up there perhaps he changes some minds /.
Maybe that 's -- uh that 's not going to happen /.
but the bottom line this is that this is not an administration that thinks very highly of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> /.
and the only real engagement we want to have at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> is to try to clean the place up /.
And so they 're going to stand by the guy they think who can really do that /.
and this is very much a statement that the president was not going to be deterred from making in terms of his views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> and how it ought to operate /.
How ra- how big a role has the vice president had in this appointment and this continuation to fight for him to the point of naming him a recess appointment /?
I think huge /.
And and in fact it 's the vice president who 's very close to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> , who has been a real stalwart for him throughout this process /.
And I think it 's perfectly clear that uh that he made the argument to the president that you do n't wobble on this one , that this is an important player in our agenda with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> /.
Okay thank you very much <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Gregory</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norm Coleman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> is a member of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Foreign Relations Committee</ENAMEX> which held the nomination hearings on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> /.
Senator let me ask you about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> /.
The president referred to a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> /.
Who is he talking about /.
who held up this nomination /?
Well the bottom line is that there were <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifty - six</ENAMEX> votes for cloture /.
so the majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> supported ending the debate /.
I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolton</ENAMEX> would have gotten <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than fifty - six</ENAMEX> votes to be confirmed /.
so a majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> supported <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> /.
and in most democracies majorities actually get their way /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> procedure allows a minority to block this nomin- nomination /.
and they did /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> other things /.
the bottom line is you 're forgetting there 's a conference on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> reform major conference <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September fourteenth through the sixteenth</ENAMEX> /.
The president is going to be there make a major statement now he has got somebody who is there , who is his guy , who is going to work with him over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these six weeks</ENAMEX> /.
This is an important period of time /.
We 've been <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</ENAMEX> without a permanent representative /.
The time was to do it now /.
and the president I believe did the right thing /.
Let 's listen to Senator and former former Majority leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> senator from that state /.
Here 's what he said that he opposed the recess appointment of uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> /.
I have advised against it /.
Uh I think that he was not confirmed /.
And if he went in there he would be limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">like seventeen months</ENAMEX> /.
Uh perhaps uh he would not be weakened /.
but uh you know it it appears to me that he would /.
Uh but uh I I would recommend against a recess appointment /.
What do you make of that Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> /?
I disagree with my my friend and respected colleague <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX> /.
Bottom line is that this is an important moment /.
This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> is is reeling from the aftermath of the investigation that we 've done on oil for food /.
And they 've been reeling from from the child prostitution in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> from the sexual harassment of top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> personnel /.
They finally understand they have got to make change /.
Uh hopefully get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a John Bolton</ENAMEX> who can force the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zimbabwe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX> to understand that we have got to get rid of the odious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Human Rights Commission</ENAMEX> /.
And so the time is now /.
Eh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> is only going to be in office <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple more years</ENAMEX> /.
that that that 's how permanent permanent will be /.
Uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> will be there during probably the most important time for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">many many years</ENAMEX> /.
Do you think there 's a value in itself in having someone to go up there and just waste the place I mean in other words just give tough speeches try to humiliate them uh try to get them out and get them straightened out by just making fun of them by basically trashing some of those <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Third World</ENAMEX> members that have contributed to this uh horror in some of these cases you mentioned /?
I do n't think anyone -- uh I do n't think there 's -- there 's any basis for saying that 's what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> is going to do /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> by the way was a very effective assistant of state /.
He helped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> get rid of its odious <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Zionism</ENAMEX> is racism resolution in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteen ninety - one</ENAMEX> when people said that could n't be done /.
So do n't underestimate the skill of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> /.
Is there a time to be tough /?
Yeah /.
And he can be tough /.
Is there a time to be persuasive /?
Yeah /.
He can be persuasive /.
He 's got a record of doing that /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> officials themselves have said that /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malloch Brown</ENAMEX> has said that /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kofi Annan</ENAMEX> has said that /.
So I think it would be a mistake to simply <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> as a tough guy who is going to push folks around /.
But he knows how to get things done /.
The moment for reform is now /.
and if we miss that moment shame on us /.
Do you worry about him rattling the cage of uh the head of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> with comments like he 's a tyrannical dictator /?
You 're dealing with a guy who is living on booze most of the time and delusions and movies and girlfriends provided for him /.
Do you think it 's safe to call him names /?
You 're not talking about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> now when you say that , right /?
No I 'm talking about the head of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> /.
Do you think it 's safe to to rattle the cage of a crazy man /?
Uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> as you -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> as as as you well know /-
I should n't say crazy man /.
He might hear this /.
How about an unusual leader /?
Eh everything that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> said about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim Jong</ENAMEX> was approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Department</ENAMEX> /.
There 's not a record on it not a single thing in the record /.
I sat through all the *hearings hearings and read all the stuff /.
there 's not a single thing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> said that was n't approved by higher powers /.
Tyrannical dictator hellish nightmare on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the eve</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> nation talks /?
That 's what he is /.
Oh yeah we know that /.
The truth hurts so much with this guy /-
So your listeners understand -- your listeners understand there 's not a single thing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> said during that entire process that was not vetted , that was not cleared and that was not approved /.
So he is a tyrannical dictator for whatever reason folks said /.
that 's the -- that 's the approach we 're going to use /.
and so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> was n't off the reservation and was n't speaking out of school /.
he was speaking truth /.
and it was approved truth /.
What do you think about his comment that we we we could lose the top <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</ENAMEX> floors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> building and it would n't hurt /?
I hope he does n't have an office on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of those top <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</ENAMEX> floors /.
Uh yeah you sound like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Boxer</ENAMEX> now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> /.
You know the reality he was saying that -- he was saying that -- he was saying that comment to a group -- he was saying that comment to a group of folks /.
It was -- it was a meeting in which they 're talking about <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> world government /.
He was saying hey folks it 's not going to happen /.
Oh do n't /.
no no /.
now now we 're at war /.
What did you just say /?
Uh I do n't think so /.
It 's not going to happen /.
And the bottom line is that a lot of folks would say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> has not been as effective as it should be /.
My investigation has *shown shown mismanagement at least perhaps corruption at worst /.
Right /.
An- and so there are a lot of folks saying you got to make change in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> /.
That 's what that was all about /.
And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> recognized it now /.
That 's why they 're holding this meeting on reform /.
That 's why the president is going to be speaking there /.
And he has got a guy by his side who can help make that happen /.
So I should n't have quoted him /.
I made a mistake there Senator /.
You you you just jumped on me because I quoted him saying it would be all right if they lost the top <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</ENAMEX> floors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">UN</ENAMEX> /.
And and was I wrong to do that /?
No /.
it was a comment /.
it eh eh it was n't -- it was n't your quote /.
it was your comment eh that you said how would you feel if you were on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of those floors /.
Tell me what you should do here /.
That 's what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brabara Boxer</ENAMEX> said in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of our hearings /.
Oh did she say that /?
Oh oh that was a mistake on my part /.
Yeah absolutely /.
and the and the reality -- wait and the reality is again the context in which he said that was very clear I think few would argue with it and that is we 're not going to a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> world government /.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> is not going to dictate <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> foreign policy and how <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> defends itself /.
On the other hand we need to work with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> has showed the ability to do that /.
and I think it would be a mistake to mischaracterize him simply as a tough or a tough guy or a bully /.
Did it bother you that when he filled out that questionnaire in the -- uh uh be- before your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</ENAMEX> your committee that he failed to note , in fact he denied , that he had been interviewed as part of the uh uh inspector general 's investigation of the initial causes for the war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /?
Yeah it does bother -- it bothers me any time uh s- somebody says something and it turns out not to be accurate /.
On the other hand if he was simply somebody that somebody talked to but there is n't any indication he was involved central to the story I have less concern /.
But does it bother me /?
Yes it did /.
I wish it did n't happen /.
Do you think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> can still play the role that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FDR</ENAMEX> and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> at that time thought it could of being the peacemaking uh organization to keep us from fighting war after war in the world /?
Can they ever play that role /?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> I I hope so /.
and I think that 's the importance of this whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> reform effort /.
That 's what this is about uh that we really do have to get rid of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Human Rights Commission</ENAMEX> /.
We have to change the focus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> so they 're not spending <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred and sixty - nine million</ENAMEX> on their communications department and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty - four million</ENAMEX> on their auditing function /.
Uh we 've got to do structural reform /.
We 've -- we 've got to do internal management reform /.
If it does that then in fact the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> can live out what it -- what it was supposed to be /.
It 's not doing that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> /.
I 'd like to change it because I do n't think the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> can be the so- world 's sole peacekeeper and world 's sole humanitarian providers /.
So we need an effective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Nations</ENAMEX> /.
It 's presently scarred presently tainted /.
Uh let 's get about reform /.
and hopefully it can get to where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FDR</ENAMEX> thought it could be /.
Thank you very much Sen- Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norm Coleman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> a perfect guest for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> /.
When we come back reaction from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's recent recess appointment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> plus what is the significance of the timing of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolton</ENAMEX> recess appointment /?
That 's ahead /.
You 're watching <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> only on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MSNBC</ENAMEX> /.
Coming up , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> is the right person for the job /.
but <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> call him damaged goods /.
The fight over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton 's</ENAMEX> recess appointment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> returns /.
Welcome back to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> /.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's recess appointment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> ambassador may be controversial among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> /.
but it 's not without precedent /.
and the move has energized both sides as they prepare for the next battle /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> correspondent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Shuster</ENAMEX> reports /.
After urging President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> not to go through with this recess appointment the reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> was harsh /.
This man uh sadly if we had a secret roll call would not be approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> /.
both in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> sides serious misgivings about whether he has the qualifications for this important assignment /.
And some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> said the president 's action is a stick in the eye just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> is preparing for confirmation hearings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Roberts</ENAMEX> the president 's nominee for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> /.
This president has more disdain for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> than any president I 've seen in my <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</ENAMEX> there /.
The president 's power to make recess appointments comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> /.
And it 's a power that dates back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Washington</ENAMEX> /.
Our nation 's founding father recessed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Rutledge</ENAMEX> on to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> only to see him formally rejected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> term /.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> made <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred and forty - three</ENAMEX> recess appointments /.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> made <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and forty</ENAMEX> /.
And to date President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has made <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and five</ENAMEX> /.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> 's recess appointments included <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Hormel</ENAMEX> an openly gay man <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> opposed to be ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Luxembourg</ENAMEX> and Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Gregory</ENAMEX> /.
I have tried for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> to put <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">an African - American</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the fourth Circuit</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> /.
Now on uh and uh for all the reasons that I made in my stated -- in in my remarks uh I think it is most unfortunate that it has not been done /.
and I am just determined to do it /.
It 's just time to do it /.
For President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> recess appointments have gone to conservative Judges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Pickering</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Pryor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Labor Department</ENAMEX> Solicitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene Scalia</ENAMEX> the son of Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonin Scalia</ENAMEX> and Undersecretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto Reich</ENAMEX> a key figure in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration 's policies toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> /.
But political analysts say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington</ENAMEX> is more bitterly divided now than it has been in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> /.
And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolton</ENAMEX> nomination fight was particularly intense /.
He has a record of trying to remove intelligence analysts who disagreed with him /.
and he also attempted to exaggerate intelligence to fit his views /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This spring</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> also played decade old tapes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolton</ENAMEX> disparaging the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">The Secretariat Building</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thirty - eight</ENAMEX> stories /.
If you lost <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</ENAMEX> stories <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> it would n't make a bit of difference /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> said his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolton</ENAMEX> 's skepticism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> combined with his hard working style would make him a perfect choice /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The United Nations</ENAMEX> is in trouble /.
It needs a strong voice from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> to help reform this vital institution and make it uh relevant and meaningful and powerful for the time that we 've -- we 've -- we find ourselves in /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> is now the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> ambassador to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> to be named through a recess appointment /.
The question is will there be any fallout at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> or any repercussions here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> have to deal with each other again <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">later this fall</ENAMEX> /?
I 'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Shuster</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> /.
Up next more on President Bush 's recess appointment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> ambassador and the latest on the heightening <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> leak investigation /.
You 're watching <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MSNBC</ENAMEX> /.
Welcome back to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> /.
More now on the recess appointment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> /.
NBC <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC News</ENAMEX> chief foreign affairs correspondent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea Mitchell</ENAMEX> joins us now /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea</ENAMEX> there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> paradigms for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> ambassador /.
There 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adlai Stevenson</ENAMEX> the old liberal who really came through during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Cuban Missile Crisis</ENAMEX> because everybody in the world believed he was n't a hawk /.
And then there was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Patrick Moynihan</ENAMEX> who went over there and took took on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Third World</ENAMEX> on issues like uh the issues of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE" S_OFF="5">anti-Israel</ENAMEX> sort of rhetoric over there and he won those battles /.
What are we looking at here a smart diplomat or a tough talker /?
I think a tough talker /.
But what he needs to learn and what I think he 's been warned about uh from diplomats up there is that you need votes /.
And he ca n't go in with a mandate that the president has given him to shake the place up with some of those pungent sound bites and get along with enough people especially because his own credibility was really on the line on some of the tough issues that he 's going to confront <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> /.
So since he 's been accused of twisting the intelligence on exactly those issues He needs some allies /.
and he 's going to have to develop those allies now /.
He will have the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Brits</ENAMEX> and some of the other traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> allies /.
but he does n't have a lot of goodwill up there /.
That said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> has experience /.
He was very successful in a previous incarnation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> when he was able to defeat the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Zionism</ENAMEX> is racism uh resolution there back then /.
And he 's a smart guy /.
So I would n't bet against him /.
What about the the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> and the world press /.
are they going to destroy him before he gets started for being a recess appointment /?
Sure but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kofi Annan</ENAMEX> look does n't have a whole lot of strength himself especially with critics here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> /.
So while he would like to warn <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> as he did <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> that there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred ninety</ENAMEX> other representatives the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> has a certain special clout /.
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annan</ENAMEX> is going to have to listen to him /.
Uh I guess that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolton</ENAMEX> had not said some of the things that he had said in the past that you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> secretariat has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thirty - eight</ENAMEX> floors and you could lose <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</ENAMEX> of them without losing anything those kinds of quotes are going to kind of haunt him /.
Do you think there 's any danger in the world of causing a real war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> again <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">another Korean war</ENAMEX> by calling the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">North Korean</ENAMEX> dictator what he is /?
I mean he calls him a tyrannical dictator /.
and he says he 's -- it 's a nightmare all over there /.
all true /.
But here 's a guy on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jack Daniels</ENAMEX> most of the time in a world of delusion /.
Is there any chance he might just rattle that cage too hard /?
Well actually <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Condi Rice</ENAMEX> herself in her own confirmation hearing had rattled that cage /.
And they 've walked way back from that /.
What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> is proving as secretary is that she 's much more pragmatic as secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">state</ENAMEX> than she was a national security adviser on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> and on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> /.
So she 's taken this this posture she 's reflecting the president 's view as adjusted for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> term and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolton</ENAMEX> is going to have to follow that line /.
He ca n't really go off on his own /.
And if he does I think she 'll reel him right back in /.
How many <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Condi Rice</ENAMEX> has to apologize or defend uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> his language /?
Maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> /.
Okay thank you very much <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea Mitchell</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two months</ENAMEX> it is /.
I 'm joined right now by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve McMahon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> political strategist and longtime adviser to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Democratic Party</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Dean</ENAMEX> I did n't know he 's been around that long and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Ginsberg</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> attorney and adviser to the conservative group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Progress For America</ENAMEX> and also a man whose card has been stamped by working hard to win the president 's recount in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> right /?
Yes sir /.
Does n't it seem to you that people like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Roberts</ENAMEX> the UN -- the uh the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> nominee have all earned their spurs through this sort of red badge of courage down in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> recount /?
I think it was the other way around /.
I think in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> we recruited the best and the brightest and people with who we knew would be excellent in really a tough and historical setting and that 's where those guys came in /.
Is that where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> learned how to be so belligerent down there in uh /-
Okay let me ask this were they -- let me ask you a tough shot /.
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> who voted against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolton</ENAMEX> and denied him an up or down vote in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> were n't they just in a certain way trying to separate themselves from having voted for the war /?
This is their chance to basically say to the president and to the country we 're not part of this war policy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> and the president /.
I actually think it was -- it was their chance to stand up and say we do n't think that somebody who was an architect of a war , who was an architect of the misleading information that we got and that the world got /.
many of the world uh then later followed us into war /-
If they bought it back before why are they not buying it now /?
Well because they 've -- they 've learned from their mistake /.
I mean obviously you know when you -- when you lead a nation and a world into war um and you are -- eh and you have the kind of record that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> has in spite of the fact that he went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> and fought in the recount I think it you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> got smart /.
Is your party ready now to come out against this war /.
or are they still going to play it both ways /?
I do n't think the party is playing it both ways /.
I think our party is going to hold our president accountable /.
Oh yes they are /.
support the troops /.
support more armor arm- armors /-
Eh uh are you for the war your party /?
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> you can be against the war and and be in favor of the troops /.
Uh uh you know I think there are a lot of different pe- /-
You ca n't answer that , can you /?
Well no our party does n't have a position /.
There are a lot of different people /-
Well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republican party</ENAMEX> has a position /.
Absolutely right /.
where are you guys /?
We- well of course <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republican Party</ENAMEX> has a position /.
The president tells them what it is /-
Have you got a party on taxes on trade on anything /?
I ca n't find the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> position on any issue <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> /.
What is your position on whether we should roll back the president 's tax cut /?
Well I think we should roll back the president 's tax cut /.
Does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Democratic Party</ENAMEX> believe that /?
I think the presiden- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Democratic Party</ENAMEX> has said you know the problem is /-
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Republican Party</ENAMEX> is for the tax cut /.
There there 's a beauty here to this kind of symmetry here /.
Well absolutely /.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> know where they stand /.
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> they are still looking for an opportunity /.
No no no /.
the Democrats the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> believe that the president has driven this country into a recession /.
The economy is is on the wrong track /.
So therefore what are you going to do about it /?
Well I think that -- I think most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> think we ought to repeal the tax cuts for the very wealthy /.
Really /?
Yeah /.
The economy is taking off /.
unemployment is down at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">five percent</ENAMEX> /.
you 've had sustained growth for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two years</ENAMEX> /.
What are you talking about /?
Okay I want to come back and talk about whether we have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">a Supreme Court</ENAMEX> that is going to change /.
Big news <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</ENAMEX> /.
Somebody says that they think that this guy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Roberts</ENAMEX> is going to end up being chief justice within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Ginsberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve McMahon</ENAMEX> are staying with us /.
You 're watching <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MSNBC</ENAMEX> /.
Have you heard that one /?
Welcome back to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> /.
We 're back with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> strategist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Ginsberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> strategist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve McMahon</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX> I have a sense this president wants this guy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> to go up to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> /.
He 's already up there /.
He 's been booed on his way into the building <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> /-
And just give them hell /.
Well I think -- look <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> is a principled guy with a lot of skills /.
He has the support of the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> the secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">state</ENAMEX> a majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> /.
Kofi Annan says he 's going to work with him /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The United Nations</ENAMEX> is doing important reform work /.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> is the right guy /.
and he is going to go in and do his job and not pay attention to the carping from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> /.
He 's basically going to waste the other side the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Third World</ENAMEX> people and just and just blow them up <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</ENAMEX> /.
No absolutely not /.
that 's not his mandate and goal /.
His mandate and goal is to fulfill the foreign policy of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> /.
and that absolutely includes helping the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Third World</ENAMEX> /.
He is so good , is n't he /?
He 's so good /.
I think it 's like sending <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Rizzo</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> /.
But that 's just a thought you know /.
a tough customer a tough cop or else how about hall monitor /.
Yeah exactly /.
You know one of these tough guys to go get these bozos in line /.
I mean I 'm talking from the the subjunctive mood of this administration /.
Well he obviously thinks he he is a hall monitor /.
I mean you you know the president may refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Rove</ENAMEX> as the architect /.
but to the rest of the world <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> is the architect of a misleading misleading the country misleading the world into a war /.
and um and then you know basically during his confirmation hearings he was asked whether he had ever been in- interrogated as part of an investigation /.
He did n't tell the truth about that /.
I mean this is an administration that that basically is rewarding somebody for not telling the truth consistently over a long period of time and for -- and for belligerently abusing his staff /.
I I do n't believe in the -- in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> debate /.
Your party stuck by what you just said about blaming <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> for the war /.
In fact they sort of nickeled and dimed him on not giving him a fair up or down vote on much less relevant points /.
We do n't have all the papers that we think we need /.
and they kept playing that sort of rope a dope game /.
There was nothing about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> as the architect for the war /.
It was a much shriller sort of less relevant debate that you guys did /.
Could n't could n't the strategy of the president be this guy is going to be his lightning rod /?
They 'll hate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> /.
they wo n't hat- hate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is all right /.
I sort of like him /.
this guy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolton</ENAMEX> is no good /.
The old Bobby Kennedy you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kennedy</ENAMEX> would send <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby</ENAMEX> out there /.
Be mad at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby</ENAMEX> /.
that 's your job /.
Is that what this is about /?
Not Bobb- /-
Yeah /.
Nobody is going to like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year from now</ENAMEX> , are they /?
Well you know in about -- in about -- in about about <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year and a half from now</ENAMEX> he wo n't -- he wo n't either /.
He 's not going to get reupped /.
Is there any chance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> will confirm him /?
Will the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> you think /-
Let me ask you a question /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Ginsberg</ENAMEX> will the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> eventually confirm this guy to a full appointment /.
Yeah I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> is going to surprise people the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> /-
Will they -- will that happen /?
Yes depending on the election results /.
Oh depending on /-
What do you mean /?
Well the he is -- his his term ends in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January of oh seven</ENAMEX> /.
There are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> elections in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November of oh six</ENAMEX> /.
So if your party picks up seats he 'll get confirmed /?
Yeah when we pick up the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> seats to give us filibuster proof /.
It will be easy /.
and without that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton 's</ENAMEX> performance will do it /.
What a standard you 're setting /.
In other words if they get a veto uh uh uh what do you call it a fili- filibuster proof majority /-
He 'll -- he will -- he will go up -- he will go up and get confirmed anyways because of the job he 's going to do /.
Somebody somebody said on one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</ENAMEX> shows I think they 're right if it were a secret vote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> would n't carry the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> caucus /.
and I think that 's absolutely right /.
And if it were an up or down vote he would have been confirmed because he had a majority of support in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> /.
Do you think he would carry the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> caucus vote /?
Yes he had a majority -- he had a majority of support on the cloture petitions /.
it was n't enough to get <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sixty</ENAMEX> /.
Are we going anywhere in this uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> investigation /?
Here 's the question I ask you /.
Will this end up in a simple report from uh from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Fitzgerald</ENAMEX> the investigator the prosecutor from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> /.
or will he end up with some really serious indictments <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Ginsberg</ENAMEX> /?
I think we do n't know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> of all /.
but no it does n't appear like right now that there are likely to be uh indictments certainly on the leak /.
but there is it seems a lot going on beneath the surface and certainly a lot of speculation uh going on in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> /.
So you 're not -- you 're betting against perjury indictments /?
I would -- I I would -- I would suspect no /.
Obstruction of justice indictments /.
But as I say there 's a lot going on /.
I do n't think it 's going to be perjury or obstruction if there are indictments at all /.
I I I think it 's pretty difficult to have an investigation of this length at this cost to put a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New York Times</ENAMEX> uh reporter in jail for this length of time /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX> did n't they work for the secretary of agriculture for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> and go for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">like three hundred years</ENAMEX> /.
and they never got anything on the guy /?
/.
Well this investigation they never put a reporter in jail -- they never put a reporter in jail for something /.
In fact it 's never happened before /.
/.
They got him with the basketball tickets /.
But she 's not talking /.
They do n't have a witness /.
Well they 've got plenty of witnesses /.
and they have got plenty -- they have got plenty of ammunition /.
What do you think charge- /-
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX> what 's the charge going to be /?
I think -- I think you 're going to see perjury or obstruction of justice because I I frankly do n't think that on a -- on a technical specific intent crime like the one that was originally alleged they 're going to -- they 're going to probably return an indictment because it 's a specific intent crime /.
But on obstruction and on perjury it looks like there 's plenty of room /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Wilson</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Rove</ENAMEX> will be frog - walked out of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the White House</ENAMEX> /.
uh uh he means in chains /.
Do you think that is going to happen /?
I I think that 's unlikely /.
Unlikely /.
This investigation got so much scrutiny from the media when it started that if you were going to do a no prosecution in this case you would have to ask a huge number of questions just as the prosecutor is doing to be able to come up with that no prosecution /.
You know what I think /?
By the way /-
I think they 've got a huge paper trail /.
They 've been interviewing people interrogating them before a grand jury for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> /.
They have so many potential contradictions /.
And having watched what this fellow Pet- uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Fitzgerald</ENAMEX> did in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week ago</ENAMEX> with the adm- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daley</ENAMEX> administration where he took down the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> top guys on patronage which most people would say is n't that what they do out there in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> , I think he 's serious business /.
I would look out for this guy if I were in the -- in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> staff /.
Yeah and by the way I was -- I was commenting on the frog - walk /.
I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Rove</ENAMEX> may have a real problem on his hands /.
I do n't think he 'll be frog - walked /.
I think if there 's any way the president can stand by his man he will but it 's going to get maybe a little bit more difficult for him to do that /.
Is anybody going to stay on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> staff who has been indicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX> /?
Once indicted /.
I think once you 're indicted it 's difficult to keep anyone on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> staff /.
Do you think this is going to be the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> term booboo of this administration /?
Like they always seem to have <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> /.
this president has n't suffered <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> yet /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Iran - Contra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> they all seem to have a problem /.
uh ba- uh you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman Adams</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eisenhower</ENAMEX> the court packing by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FDR</ENAMEX> /.
It 's almost automatic this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> term problem /.
And if -- and if you look at the way they 've handled this publicly ba- basically if they handled it within the grand jury the same way they handled it publicly by dissembling and misleading and in some cases maybe ou- outright misrepresentation of the truth it it it it seems pretty likely that it 's going to lead to some criminal activity because this guy is there to do a job and he 's not a partisan but he 's a very tough prosecutor /.
In fact he was originally uh an appointee of the president 's father /.
So this is not a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> witch hunt /.
it 's a very serious matter /.
and I think you know these guys may have some problems on their hand /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX> do you think /.
a lot of fights that have been going on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last couple of days</ENAMEX> whether it 's the j- nomination to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> the issue of the -- of the the leak investigation if you write the history now <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years from now</ENAMEX> , what the real fight is about is the recriminations over whether we should have gone to war /.
and that is what the fight is about /.
Well I 'm not sure I agree with that /.
It seems to me the overlook story is the real accomplishments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> bipartisan uh on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past week</ENAMEX> /.
Yeah /.
You had energy /.
you had transportation /.
uh you 've had tort reform /.
you 've had bankruptcy bills /.
you got an economy that 's going along uh pretty well /.
This has been an aura of -- an era of achievement for the president /.
And I do n't think you 're going to be going back looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this period in time</ENAMEX> uh in that -- in that lens yeah /.
As fail period /.
Uh I I think the story of this administration especially this this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> term is arrogance and abuse of power /.
I mean basically anybody who gets in their way they knock down /.
As bad as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FDR</ENAMEX> in the second term /?
Worse worse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> way /-
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> /?
Well you know uh we 've learned that perjury is a problem for public officials /.
and we learned it from so- a matter as unusual as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> /.
But in fact <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX> I think I sat on a lot of shows with you talking about that very subject /.
and you had a differen- -- you were singing a different tune then , were n't you /?
Okay we learned a lot <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> /.
You say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> will be confirmed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</ENAMEX> /?
Yes /.
Well no in the end at the end when his term is up /.
You believe he will not be /?
In early <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early two thousand seven</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> will be packed with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> by then /.
No because he 's going to do such a good job he 's going to deserve /-
Absolutely /.
And you believe there will be indictments coming out of this investigation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> leak /?
Uh I think it 's more likely than not yeah /.
You think there wo n't be /?
I think that there wo n't be of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> staff /.
Okay thank you very much /.
I think the differences of opinion here /-
Thank you very much <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Ginsberg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> strategist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve McMahon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> strategist he said breathlessly /.
Uh next a delegation of conservative radio this is so hot radio talk show hosts from around the country went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> to oppose what they call the liberal media bias against that war /.
What 's really going on in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /?
We 're going to hear from a radio talk show host who was there and an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> war veteran /.
they go to war /.
You 're watching <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> only on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MSNBC</ENAMEX> /.
Coming up , conservative radio talk show hosts say the media is missing the story in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
That debate it 's a hot one when <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> returns /.
Welcome back to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> /.
This is going to be great /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melanie Morgan</ENAMEX> is a radio talk show from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KSFL AM five seventy</ENAMEX> /.
She 's also chairwoman or chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Move America Forward</ENAMEX> /.
She recently returned from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half dozen</ENAMEX> other conservative radio talk show hosts where they broadcast for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</ENAMEX> in order to combat what she calls the mainstream media and liberals ' attempt to undermine the war effort with negative news /.
Also joining us right now is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Rieckhoff</ENAMEX> /.
He 's a veteran of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> war and founder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Operation Truth</ENAMEX> dot org the nation 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> and largest advocacy group for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> war veterans /.
I 'm going to start with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melanie</ENAMEX> just back <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days ago</ENAMEX> what did you smell over there /?
What did you see /?
Well first of all it was <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a hundred and twenty - five degrees</ENAMEX> in the shade in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
Um and when you 're wearing like I was <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twenty - five pounds</ENAMEX> of body armor um and sweating through your clothes and trying to stay hydrated um in the middle of a sandstorm um where we were trapped on a couple of different occasions it was pretty grueling tough work and an assignment that made me have a tremendous appreciation of what our troops are going through on a day to day basis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
What did you -- what did you get from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> /?
Do they like us /.
Do they dislike us /.
Are they neutral /?
Are they waiting to see who wins or what /?
I think that many of of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> at least the ones with whom I spoke felt very strongly that they appreciated the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> presence there /.
They are obviously extremely concerned about the level of violence that is is coming from the insurgency /.
but there 's a reason for it /.
and you have n't heard this discussed in the mainstream media because nobody has brought it up /.
The reason why they are concerned is because they know that the upcoming August and December referential -- uh the constitutional referendum is terribly important /.
the insurgency made a strategic and tactical error by not disrupting the last election back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> /.
They know that it 's coming time around /.
But if those elections go successfully as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> military is hoping and planning for as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> army then they 're -- we are going to start discussing the possibility of drawing down down our troops /.
And that 's something that I learned and reported on while I was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
And it was n't until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days later</ENAMEX> I finally started seeing something in the front pages of the daily newspapers /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> you helped fight that war /.
your reaction to what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melanie</ENAMEX> just said /?
Well I think it 's great that some reporters are headed over there and trying to get a taste and a feel for what soldiers like me lived <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</ENAMEX> /.
And I was there for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Central Baghdad</ENAMEX> /.
And I saw the good the bad and everything in between /.
And I think reporters need to really continue to go outside their area of comfortability outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Green Zone</ENAMEX> /.
But I think the reality is that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> like most reporters are really spoon - fed uh their experience there /.
They 're prada- -- they 're provided with with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DOD</ENAMEX> contractors or uh military security personnel /.
and what they get is a very narrow understanding of what the day to day life is /.
Not enough reporters are really going outside of that comfortability factor and going beyond that to try to experience what we as soliders experience /.
What makes -- wha- what what makes you assume that I stayed inside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the green zone</ENAMEX> /?
That 's another thing that you 've written about me that is a lie /.
That 's not what I said ma'am /.
What I said was that you did n't get out of your comfortbility zone /.
What you /-
If I could finish I 'll respond /.
I think that you were there for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days</ENAMEX> /.
And I think you got your feet wet /.
and that 's nice /.
But then you back to your comfortable house in the civilian world /.
and the soliders stayed there /.
Excuse me <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> /.
I think if you really wanted a taste of that experience you could spend more time there /.
Excuse me <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> /.
I have spent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</ENAMEX> as as a correspondant /.
I was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bejing</ENAMEX> when when college students were being murdered /.
I covered their dead bodies /.
I have been to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteen eighty three</ENAMEX> /.
I 've seen the dead and and and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> wounded /.
I have ha- had a long and extensive career /.
So please do n't lecture me about my comfortability zone /.
Let me go -- let me go to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melanie</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melanie</ENAMEX> I want to get some reporting here an opportunity to report /.
When you talked to regular <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> what were they telling you /?
Did you get a sense /-
I know you could n't take a poll in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days</ENAMEX> /.
but what were they saying about our presence /?
Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> were fearful because of the extraordinary level of IED improvised explosive devices that were going off and killing people /.
But here 's the the fact of the matter /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">The day</ENAMEX> that I was there there were -- uh there were <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thirty - three</ENAMEX> young school children who were killed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about six</ENAMEX> blocks away from where I was located because an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> soldier had the audacity to hand them candy because we were at the same time passing out soccer balls um at orphanages /.
We we talked to these people /.
They are grateful because we are feeding and helping to train these people to take over the responsibility for their government /.
and it 's a responsibility <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> that they are very eager to assume /.
Do you believe this is to me /-
I 'm not over there /.
I have n't been over there /.
The question I want to know is who is going to win this war based on fighting zeal /?
We saw for years as you described and everybody else knows for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> the minority in that country were the bullies of that country /.
They ran it because they were good smart vicious bullies /.
How do we know that those bullies wo n't eventually grab control again <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the minute</ENAMEX> we leave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melanie</ENAMEX> /?
We have no idea what 's going to happen /.
I 'm not uh uh uh a psychic /.
I ca n't read the future /.
But what I can tell you is that when I talked to er the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> general in charge of training troops over there he was telling us some very good news /.
There are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">sixty percent</ENAMEX> troop strength now /.
um in in terms of where they are are trying to attain a goal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a hundred percent</ENAMEX> readiness they 're at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">sixty percent</ENAMEX> /.
Um they 're making progress <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</ENAMEX> /.
and the fact of the matter is is the Iraqis keep -- no matter how many times they are killed and blown up um by the insurgents , they come back and they -- and and more people -- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> times as many people joined that line at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> police recruiting station after the previous bomb explosion because they want to be invested in this country in their country /.
You can not -- you can not breathe democracy at this without -- at these people without them breathing it in inhaling it and enjoying and wanting it even more badly /.
The same question to you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> /.
You know in the beginning of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War Two</ENAMEX> the worst thing that happened uh in the century uh the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> army was bigger and more impressive than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> army /.
but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> army wanted to kill /.
It wanted to take land /.
it had revenge in its heart /.
It had that ferocity of the fighter /.
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> did not /.
They wanted the thing over with /.
they wanted the phony war to continue /.
Do you think the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shia</ENAMEX> who are the majority of the new government have that fighting hatred or whatever you want to call it the zeal to defeat bullies this time /.
or are we going to lose this fight /?
/.
You know I think that 's the bigger question /.
And the bigger question is are we winning or are we losing /?
Are we making more than we 're killing /?
And I think that 's the real question we have to answer /.
And day to day what I saw was that we were in the macro-perspective making more enemies than we 're killing /.
and this goes beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> /.
How are we doing that /?
What did you see /?
By by our occupation and also by our bullying tactics by our failure to offer economic solutions and diplomatic solutions our failure to have enough interpreters on the ground our failure to provide a secure situation /.
we 've never had enough troops on the ground /.
And when I got to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> at the outset we could n't provide overwhelming force to establish security /.
And we 've been playing catchup *ever ever since /.
Should we have gone in not gone in or gone in with greater strength /?
Of those <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> options what are you more comfortable with /?
Go in not go in or go in with greater strength /.
Ah as a solider it was not up to me whether or not we went in /.
But it is now you 're a citizen /.
What should we have done /?
I went in /.
I w- /-
Right /.
I think when we went in there and when we committed to doing it we should have done it the right way /.
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colin Powell</ENAMEX> called for overwhelming force /.
General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shinseki</ENAMEX> said we needed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred thousand</ENAMEX> of troops on the ground /.
and what we really need from the *journalistic journalistic community and the administration is honest candor about where are we now and how long are we going to be there /?
And I think when Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> she goes over there and cheerleads and really does n't provide an accurate analysis of the long term obstacles that we 're up against it 's disingenuous /.
Okay if you 're president last question <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> should we send more troops over there or bring them all back /?
What should we do /?
It it depends on what you want to achieve /.
Well what do you want to achieve /?
But I think -- I think if we want to lock down a security situation it 's going to take more troops /.
More troops /.
And I think that 's a political /-
That is the conservative argument /.
and we hear that from a lot of people <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Kristol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> /.
Yeah /.
and that 's a /-
A lot of people think uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Kyl</ENAMEX> more troops /.
We 'll be right back with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Rieckhoff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melanie Morgan</ENAMEX> /.
You 're watching <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hardball</ENAMEX> only on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MSNBC</ENAMEX> /.
We 're back with radio talk show host <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melanie Morgan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> war veteren <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Rieckhoff</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melanie</ENAMEX> how do we get the straight scoop on what 's happening in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> because people tell me there 's only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> ways to go over there as a journalist I think your experience confirms this you either go over there and stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the green zone</ENAMEX> or that that part of uh uh which is very secure and it 's basically a compound or you go out with a unit as an embedded -- uh basically part of the unit an embedded reporter /.
You never really get to mix with the locals /.
Uh how do you do it to find out whether they 're -- we 're actually winning the uh war over there /.
Well that 's exactly what I did /.
I went out um and visited with the troops /.
and I went outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the green zone</ENAMEX> unlike uh Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rieckhoff</ENAMEX> has accused me of doing /.
But do you -- outside that how do you get out there with the people /?
Well because you get out there with the troops /.
They take you in in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Humvees</ENAMEX> and in up- armored /-
Then you get out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Humvees</ENAMEX> /.
and and you hand out soccer balls /.
and you go to orphanages /.
and and you talk uh and hold hold babies and talk with the people who are taking care of them /.
All of these things that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</ENAMEX> members of our entourage did /-
But do speak of do people speak freely -- do people speak freely when there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Humvee</ENAMEX> standing next to them /?
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Move America Forward</ENAMEX> /.
Because let me /-
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> /-
No /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> uh let me just say <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing /.
Before Mr. m- m- -- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rieckhoff</ENAMEX> has written um that our group are a bunch of bigots idiots and propagandists /.
and that 's before he even cracked a sweat /.
Now I want to tell you that there is something very important a message that is very important that I wanted to articulate here /.
Our men and women are living and dying in ghastly conditions /.
Uh it 's hot <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a hundred and twenty - five degrees</ENAMEX> /.
They are making peace in in in sandstorms /.
They are doing their dead level best to make this policy that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration has put forth work /.
I think that as an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> people the stories that I tell from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and that our fellow talk show hosts told um eh uh hopefully will engender a little bit more patience and endurance by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> people /.
I think we owe our troops that /.
Let me ask you the same question <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> /.
How do you get the the true scoop over there if you 're always with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> troops /?
I mean do you ever get to talk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> /?
Maybe it 's just a catch <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty - two</ENAMEX> /.
they 're too dangerous to deal with /.
But how do you get the story /?
The the reality is you do n't /.
And I think Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> is really insulting all the troops who 've been there to assume that by going for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days</ENAMEX> and taking a few casual leisurely trips outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Green Zone</ENAMEX> that she got a full taste of combat /.
I think the reality is much different /.
And if reporters really want to do some investigative reporting they can fly into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX> and go unembedded /.
Now there is a chance they might get their head cut off /.
But that 's the reality that we face as soldiers <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</ENAMEX> /.
I think really the best way to do it is to talk to the troops coming home /.
We 're ready /.
we 're -- we 're willing and able to come on your program and others and talk about our experiences and really try to educate the public about the reality of all sides of this conflict /.
Well guess what /.
that 's exactly what we did /.
We stuck a microphone in front of all of the troops /.
Ma'am you did it with -- you did /-
We stuck a microphone and let them -- let them talk directly to the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> /.
You did it while they were on active duty /.
Ma'am you did while they were on active duty /.
Unfiltered by the main stream media that does n't have the guts /-
Are you going to yell over me the entire show /?
I 'm -- I 'm trying to respond to /-
Okay her turn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melanie</ENAMEX> your turn /.
Take a minute <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melanie</ENAMEX> /.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melanie</ENAMEX> make your point /.
I 'm sorry /.
No interruptions please <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> /.
give her <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a minute</ENAMEX> /.
What I want to say is that we took our microphones to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> troops /.
and if you think that what we heard from them are lies then you are accusing the troops of being liars because we did not filter or editorialize or in any way try to massage their message /.
They gave us the story as they see it /.
and if you do n't believe it then you are doing a disservice to your fellow troops /.
Ma'am uh uh go ahead /.
Oh let me go <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> before you start /.
What I keep doing here is asking people on and off camera who come on this program high - ranking officers enlisted uh former officers /.
Uh I get sometimes not all the time <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> different versions the version they give me on the air and the version they give me <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the minute</ENAMEX> when we 're off the air /.
The version they give me when we 're on the air is gung ho we 're doing the right thing , everything is moving along /.
The version they give me off the air is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> is crazy there are n't enough troops over there we 're not taking this seriously enough or we should n't be there sometimes /.
It is n't always a straight scoop /-
/.
when you go on televsion with people because they want to be loyal to their units and their their service /.
That 's exactly right /.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> I 'm no -- I 'm -- There 's no one more loyal to the troops than I am /.
I am still in the reserves /.
There 's a likelihood that I 'll go back while Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> is back at her radio show /.
So what I really want to do is educate the public about the truth of what 's happening there /.
And I think the reality is that when people like her go over there there 's a public affairs officer standing right next to that young soldier /.
And he 's on active duty /.
and he wants to support the cause /.
And he ca n't speak freely /.
That 's a fact /.
A young blogger was just reprimanded <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> because he was a little too candid /.
When they come home let me finish ma'am when I -- when they come home their cuffs /-
That 's not true /.
