According to what has been reported in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">" Science and Life "</ENAMEX> magazine , biologists in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> have discovered that a mold element in the cells of plants can not only control the propagation of plasmodium in mosquitoes , but can also kill mosquitoes .
This method will not pollute the environment .
Biologists mixed a mold element in the cells of plants with pearl powder to produce a granulated drug .
This kind of drug can slowly discharge the mold element from the cells of plants in water .
When mosquitoes feed , they suck the mold element from the cells of plants into their bodies .
Experiments have shown that adopting this method can reduce the chances of mosquitoes transmitting malaria down to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/70th</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/80th</ENAMEX> of the original ratio .
