In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> the latest opinion polls show hard - liner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ariel Sharon</ENAMEX> is virtually assured of winning <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week 's</ENAMEX> national election .
The story from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross Don</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> .
An opinion poll published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jerusalem Post</ENAMEX> newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ariel Sharon</ENAMEX> , Chairman of the right wing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Likud Party</ENAMEX> , has a commanding <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</ENAMEX> - point lead over Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Barak</ENAMEX> .
According to the poll , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49 percent</ENAMEX> of those interviewed said they would vote for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon</ENAMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 percent</ENAMEX> would support Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> .
Another Poll , this one in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> daily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yudiad Acronod</ENAMEX> found that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon</ENAMEX> had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</ENAMEX> lead over Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> .
All such surveys show the gap between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> candidates is widening but that former Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shimon Peres</ENAMEX> , a member of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Labour Party</ENAMEX> , would have a better chance of defeating Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon</ENAMEX> , but despite his poor standing in the opinion polls , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> says he has no intention of standing down in favor of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> daily newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harord</ENAMEX> says that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> 's inner circle of advisors has told him he may have to reconsider his position .
