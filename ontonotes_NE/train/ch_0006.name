%huh ?
What price ?
%uh , free Free ! which is even better , yes
Wow .
mhm .
But what about you ?
%uh , then I 'll work on me .
%uh because see if I do n't I , if I do n't get back %uh like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> it 's no big deal .
I could just stay here .
So it 's not important for me .
Right .
You see ?
So the main thing is to get your , your deal .
So you might not come back here ?
Right .
Got you .
See I 'm only be there for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">like three or four days</ENAMEX> .
Right .
So I mean if it 's going to cost me an arm and a leg it 's cheaper if I just stay here .
Right .
So you do n't need
Because I do n't have to do anything but work <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</ENAMEX>
so .
Right .
Well what happens to your work then ?
Well I just wo n't do it .
But I mean if I have to pay you know , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a thousand dollars</ENAMEX> it 's not expeditious to make <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</ENAMEX> and That 's a big word . Those crosswords are making you use big words . pay <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</ENAMEX> .
Is that what it is ?
Getting better ?
uh-huh .
mhm %hm
That 's the purpose .
uh-huh .
Increase your word power .
mhm .
So %um Well you know that would , that would be the the thing .
I mean there 's no way
I 'm sure you 're not going to get back %uh you know <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">within a day or two</ENAMEX> of the time . You know because there 're <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighteen hundred</ENAMEX> flights that %uh that go back .
I 'm not on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American</ENAMEX> .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American</ENAMEX> .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American</ENAMEX> .
They go from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> .
oh this is a flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> ?
Right .
I see .
Right .
And then %uh just get the %uh connecting flight .
Can you get me a connecting flight ?
Well that should n't be a problem .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan</ENAMEX> said there 's no inter-Europe flights .
Right .
Right .
No ,
I can go down to the place here and
Sure .
Sure .
%uh %uh nothing 's %uh %uh possible with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan</ENAMEX> .
No ,
everybody who does n't have a ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a month ago</ENAMEX> is not going to fly for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the rest of the year</ENAMEX> .
So you do n't want a ticket to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> , for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">nine hundred dollars</ENAMEX> ?
Well again that 's the point .
I mean if it 's going to cost that %uh It 's easier for me just to get yours than not do one .
okay
You see ?
mhm .
%um
I 'm eating a banana ,
excuse me .
It just
I see .
You know it just %uh depends on if you would just like the you know stand by
that 's the
Well
You know to have a sh-
you know
And I 'd have to stand by in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> by myself .
uh-huh .
Like a big girl ,
yes .
Yes .
Exactly .
but exactly .
That 's the , that 's the thing .
You know we just pick a , Amazing . just pick a day %uh you know
like probably the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the %uh first of August</ENAMEX> would be the best time .
Right .
%um <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Mondays</ENAMEX> sometimes people coming back
but %uh , you know nobody leaves on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesdays</ENAMEX> .
Well do you think it would be better to come like on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that Friday the twenty - first</ENAMEX>
and then I 'd be closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of August</ENAMEX> anyways ?
%uh , well I mean that 's some- Can we do that ? %mm that 's something you could do .
%uh , you know the other thing is
Because if you 're not coming anyways then Right . I do n't have to fly with you so I could just come <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that Friday</ENAMEX> .
Right .
Well , the other thing is is that you could just stay longer .
Right .
Exactly .
Get a short flight .
Just stay longer .
Well , yeah ,
but
mhm .
Maybe you came like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the twenty first</ENAMEX> %uh ,
It would be %uh <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a little over three weeks</ENAMEX> instead of
Right .
mhm .
I think I should go back to work
but I think it would be better if I came on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the twenty first</ENAMEX>
that way then .
uh-huh .
If you can change it .
Well I can probably change it .
Because that way oh . I 'll be closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of August</ENAMEX>
and hopefully if there 's , when the problems arise with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Steel</ENAMEX> , I 'm not going to even say if . %um , I can resolve it from here and not have it ruin my vacation .
uh-huh .
Right .
oh that 's true .
You know I 'd rather not have to be doing that craziness
and I 'd still be there for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B B King</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Etta James</ENAMEX> .
duh , duh , buh , buh , duh duh .

so yeah you 'd get here <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the twenty second</ENAMEX> .
It is true .
%um
You know
and if they did n't have room on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the twenty first</ENAMEX> I could come <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the twentieth</ENAMEX> just <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</ENAMEX> , by myself <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</ENAMEX> .
