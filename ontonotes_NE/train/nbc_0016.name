Good <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</ENAMEX> .
There is n't a national poll in the race between Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> and Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> that shows a clear advantage for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> or the other with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> weekends to go .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MSNBC</ENAMEX> / <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Reuters</ENAMEX> tracking poll , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> is hanging onto a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - point lead over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the second day in a row</ENAMEX> , but all these polls , it 's important to point out , are within a margin of error that could flip the results .
What they 're really telling us is that the race appears to be a dead heat , and with time running short , the final strategies are taking a sharper form .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Gregory</ENAMEX> is with the governor again <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire Shipman</ENAMEX> with the Vice President .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> campaign worried about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Nader</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> , the greening of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> --
His environmental message has n't always been a priority on the campaign trail , but now , with fears of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Nader 's</ENAMEX> growing support , it could be critical .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> hopscotching across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Midwest</ENAMEX> , reminding voters of his environmentalist credentials .
Together , we can clean up the environment .
Seizing on a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.N.</ENAMEX> report about global warming , he pitches his message in diners .
One that I 've worked on a lot , one people do n't talk about , is global warming .
And even to TV personality <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Latifah</ENAMEX> .
The environment is at stake in this election .
Why ?
It 's a message that appeals to those critical undecided voters and especially the supporters of this man , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Nader</ENAMEX> .
Once a minor distraction , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> aides now fear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nader</ENAMEX> could cost them the election .
How much can <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nader</ENAMEX> hurt ?
Take <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> , a state <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> was counting on .
A recent poll has <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 %</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41 %</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nader</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> .
In traditionally <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 %</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41 %</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> .
Here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> has an edge in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> poll , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> in another .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nader</ENAMEX> remains steady at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> .
Those statistics have <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> cranking up the heat on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nader</ENAMEX> supporters .
Former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> rival <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> , on the stump <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington State</ENAMEX> .
Pro-choice organizations are spending big money for ads like this one to make the case that a vote for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nader</ENAMEX> could mean the end of a woman 's right to choose .
Before voting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nader</ENAMEX> , consider the risk .
It 's your choice .
Environmental groups are also getting involved .
Some prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> are thinking about a full - page ad in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Times</ENAMEX> , '' and look for states like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> to figure prominently on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> 's travel schedule in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the final week</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> ?
Thanks very much , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire Shipman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> .
As for Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , he had some high - powered help <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> on the campaign trail and a more pointed commentary on the Vice President .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Gregory</ENAMEX> with the Vice President in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> , making it abundantly clear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> / <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> scandals of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past eight years</ENAMEX> will be a major theme in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the closing days</ENAMEX> of this campaign , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> attacks the Vice President for being a failed leader and promises if he 's elected <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> will once again be able to respect their government .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> campaigns <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> in this tough battleground state alongside the popular retired general <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colin Powell</ENAMEX> and again hints strongly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> will be a member of his cabinet if elected .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> 's address focuses on `` responsible leadership '' and how on issues like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Medicare</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> / <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> administration has failed to pr .
They are going out as they came in -- their guide , the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">nightly</ENAMEX> polls , their goal , the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> headlines , their legacy , the fruitless search for a legacy .
With the race so tight , advisers are hunkered down trying to for the final push , plotting out the final push that , aides say , is likely to include visits to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> different states <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> carried the last <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> elections .
Tom ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Gregory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> with Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , not with Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> , obviously .
