<DOC DOCNO="bn/cnn/01/cnn_0141@0141@cnn@bn@en@on">
Joining us <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> to put all of this in some kind of perspective is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">`` CNN Headline News '' '</ENAMEX> political analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michele Mitchell</ENAMEX> .
Hi , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michele</ENAMEX> .
Hi , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuck</ENAMEX> .
The cabinet , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> cabinet do you think it will be diverse and will he reach out to the other side of the aisle ?
He 's saying that he will , but this may be an impossible task , not because he is is n't interested in appointing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> , but because the word has gone out not to accept a position .
Now , this , of course , is part of their tactic to try to regain control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</ENAMEX> .
It may be not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's fault if you do n't see any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> faces around the table .
It 's not for want on his part .
So there is word among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> not to accept a cabinet post ?
Yes .
How can they make everybody fall into line on that ?
It 's easy .
You want the campaign funds when you run in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</ENAMEX> ?
It 's fairly easy to put pressure like that on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> .
There might be rogue <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> who is more conservative that really does n't care and is in interested in serving in a Cabinet post .
That may be where he finds the best luck .
He 's probably going to appoint <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> prominant <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">African - Americans</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> .
Any other outreach to the black community ?
I think those are the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> main appointees and the glittering stars in the crown .
That 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of his way in reaching out to the black community which feels more than alienated after this election if some of the leaders are to be believed .
Is there a risk if he becomes a centrist , does he risk alienating the hard right of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republican Party</ENAMEX> , do you think , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">the Tom D Lays</ENAMEX> and others ?
This is his big problem right away .
He is a centrist and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom D Lay</ENAMEX> has already said , Hey , look , I think what we did over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last six years</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> has been really great .
This is going to be a really big problem because the conservatives have sat on their hands , saying , If we shut up , is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> going to win ?
The conservatives want to push through the agenda .
It 's a thorn in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's side already .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> do not like each other .
Let the games begin .
All right , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michele Mitchell</ENAMEX> , thanks very much .
