<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> sources tell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> the commander of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole ''</ENAMEX> failed to implement basic measures to protect his crew .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> sailors were killed when the warship was bombed in a terrorist attack .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie McIntyre</ENAMEX> has details .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> has learned that the crew of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole ''</ENAMEX> was not briefed on the seriousness of the threat in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> , nor warned to be on guard for possible terrorist attack <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> the warship was bombed .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole ''</ENAMEX> entered the port of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> it was operating under `` threat condition Bravo , '' an alert level that warns of `` an increased and more predictable threat of terrorist activity . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> sources say <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</ENAMEX> security measures that were intended to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole ''</ENAMEX> from terrorist attack were not carried out .
While many were not required because the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> '' was refueling in the harbor , not at a pier , others were judged to be significant lapses , according to sources .
For instance , the ship protection plan filed by the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> 's '' commanding officer of terrorism and warned to be suspicious and inquisitive of strangers .
Another provision specifically warned that small boats require special concern because they can serve as an ideal platform for terrorists , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lippold</ENAMEX> failed to ensure the those briefings were given according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> sources .
The crew was also supposed to identify and inspect all work boats , keep unauthorized craft away from the ship , and prepare fire hoses to repel borders .
Those precautions were not taken either , sources say .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 - foot</ENAMEX> hole in the side of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole ''</ENAMEX> has now been patched , and the warship is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> for repairs that will cost <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 240 million</ENAMEX> and take <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</ENAMEX> to complete .
Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> officials are still debating the fate of Commander <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lippold</ENAMEX> , who along with several subordinate officers , could be subject to career - ending discipline , if it 's judged the security lapses left the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion - dollar</ENAMEX> destroyer more vulnerable to attack .
