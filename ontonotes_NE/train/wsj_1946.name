In <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> indoor air - pollution cases to go to trial , a state - court jury decided in favor of the defendant , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Burlington Industries Inc</ENAMEX> .
The verdict , reached <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late last week</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> , may end an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eight - year</ENAMEX> legal battle for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greensboro</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.C.</ENAMEX> , carpet maker .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon Beebe</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> had sued the com - pany in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> after installing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Burlington</ENAMEX> carpets in their office .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> alleged that toxic fumes from the carpets made them sick .
As a result of their illness , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> said , they lost <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 million</ENAMEX> in wages and earnings .
In addition , they said that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> of exposure to the chemicals has left them sensitive to a wide range of commonly used substances .
The case had been closely watched because attorneys anticipate increasing litigation nationally over the so - called sick - building syndrome .
Plaintiffs ' lawyers say that buildings become `` sick '' when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants to build up inside .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony J. Iaciofano</ENAMEX> , a lawyer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Burlington</ENAMEX> , said the company believes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> ' symptoms were not related to the carpeting .
He said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> ' symptoms appeared <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months later</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Adams</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> ' lawyer , said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits .
Scientists are only beginning to understand what causes sick - building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> filed the case , she said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> now believe that a prime culprit for their injuries was fumes from an adhesive used in the carpeting .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> did n't come to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in the case , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> have not yet decided whether to appeal .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">TIMES SQUARE</ENAMEX> development opponents are dealt setback .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court</ENAMEX> dismissed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> lawsuits attempting to block a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.5 billion</ENAMEX> project planned for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">42nd Street</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> .
Opponents of the project had claimed that the city and the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , which are co-sponsoring the project , had failed to adhere to environmental guidelines .
All but <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 or so</ENAMEX> lawsuits that have been filed since the project 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> approval have been dismissed before the trial stage .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> that remain have n't yet reached the pre-trial fact - finding stage .
State officials said the court 's ruling clears the way for proceedings to condemn buildings in the area .
`` This project is ready to move , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State Urban Development Corp.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Tese</ENAMEX> .
But developers of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> planned office towers cautioned that obstacles still remain .
As part of the agreement with the state , the developers -- a partnership of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Park Tower Realty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential Insurance Co. of America</ENAMEX> -- said they would not proceed with condemnation proceedings while there was `` significant litigation '' pending .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Park Tower</ENAMEX> General Counsel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Mayer</ENAMEX> said the development team will have to review <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> additional lawsuits before putting up a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 155 million</ENAMEX> letter of credit to cover condemnation costs .
Also , he said , the partnership is waiting to see whether the appellate division 's ruling will be appealed .
The plan , which has been plagued with delays and business - related setbacks , seeks to transform the area from a seedy thoroughfare to a more wholesome office and theater district .
State and city officials are still negotiating with developers to renovate historic theaters and build and operate a merchandise mart and hotel .
FEDERAL JUDGE EXPANDS role of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> courts in extradition decisions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack B. Weinstein</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , ruled that a man implicated in an attack on an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> passenger bus in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> can be extradited to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> for trial .
A magistrate had initially refused the request , ruling that the attack had been a political act for which the man , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmoud El - Abed Ahmad</ENAMEX> , would be exempt from extradition .
However , Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinstein</ENAMEX> wrote in his opinion <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late last month</ENAMEX> that terrorism and acts of war against civilians can not be defined as political acts .
Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinstein</ENAMEX> also ruled that judges must consider prior to extradition whether the defendant will be treated fairly in a foreign court .
To do so , the judge said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> courts must review the judicial process in the foreign country independently of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Department 's</ENAMEX> assessment .
He said that in this case he concurred with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Department 's</ENAMEX> decision that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmad</ENAMEX> should be extradited .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmad</ENAMEX> 's lawyer said he would appeal .
Lawyers close to the case said they believed the ruling was unprecedented .
`` Up until now the courts have said it is not their role to supervise the foreign country 's courts , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Semmelman</ENAMEX> , the assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney on the case .
FORMER <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">CANADIAN</ENAMEX> AMBASSADOR to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allan E. Gotlieb</ENAMEX> has joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> law firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pepper , Hamilton -AMP- Scheetz</ENAMEX> as a consultant .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gotlieb</ENAMEX> , who serves as a consultant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Stikeman , Elliott</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> 's biggest law firms , is advising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pepper Hamilton 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> office on legal matters related to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> - U.S. investment , corporate finance and international transactions .
QUOTABLE :
In a speech prepared for delivery in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , retired Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Powell</ENAMEX> contested the notion that the last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> term marked a turn toward conservatism : `` Commentators who agreed on little else unanimously proclaimed a ` shift in direction ' on the court ... .
I take these pronouncements , like many that have preceded them in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">past years</ENAMEX> , with a grain of salt .
In an era of ` sound bites ' and instant opinion polls it is dangerous to apply broad labels to a single term .
