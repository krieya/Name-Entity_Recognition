Cyber-literature has become a publishing phenomenon , with teenage readers idolizing its star authors : writers such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Chih - heng</ENAMEX> - who set the ball rolling with his first cyber-novel and is known online as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">" Slicker Tsai "</ENAMEX> - along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi Chi</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shuang - tzu</ENAMEX> .
How do these authors , whose literary apprenticeship has differed so much from that of other , more traditional authors , view the business of writing ?
" Dunno , " is what cyber-authors mostly reply when asked why their works have generated so much interest both in cyberspace and in the conventional publishing trade .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Chih - heng</ENAMEX> , whose online work <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The First Intimate Contact</ENAMEX> became a bookstore bestseller , elaborates a little : " It 's probably just the luck of the draw . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai</ENAMEX> released <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The First Intimate Contact</ENAMEX> on the web in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> , while reading for his doctorate at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Cheng Kung University 's Department of Hydraulics and Ocean Engineering</ENAMEX> .
He began by posting the story - based on his own love - life - in installments on a BBS , as a distraction from the pressure of writing his thesis .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The First Intimate Contact</ENAMEX> was my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> novel , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai</ENAMEX> .
" I had posted a few smaller pieces on the web before , in a similar vein , but with my scientific background I never considered myself literary material .
All I was trying to do was write down my own story in novel form . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai</ENAMEX> 's approach is to write about personal experience , with a touch of imagination thrown in .
" At first I had no intention of finishing the thing , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai</ENAMEX> candidly .
" But after a few installments the readers wanted more , and there was pressure to continue .
Eventually I put aside my doctoral thesis for a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">month</ENAMEX> or so and drilled off the rest of the novel . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai</ENAMEX> acknowledges that because of the immediacy of the medium his online work is to some degree influenced , in terms of form , content and progress , by the response of the readers - " even if a lot of that influence is unconscious . "
The author of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sunny Doll</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi Chi</ENAMEX> , has a similar experience .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sunny Doll</ENAMEX> was surprisingly popular after just a few postings , and the enthusiastic response from readers made me anxious to finish the story as soon as possible .
This probably explains the rather slapdash ending , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi Chi</ENAMEX> .
Of course there are also those like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shuang - tzu</ENAMEX> , author of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Worn - Out Socks</ENAMEX> , who remain unfazed by readers ' reactions .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shuang - tzu 's</ENAMEX> case , this reflects her experience as the administrator of a BBS site .
" The administrator is an impartial observer who does n't get involved in the online discussion , so I learned not to be easily swayed by what is being said , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shuang - tzu</ENAMEX> .
As she points out , however , online stories are often posted several at a time , or abandoned half way through when their authors find themselves too busy for writing .
" It took only <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a month and a half</ENAMEX> to write <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Worn - Out Socks</ENAMEX> , but before that I spent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year and a half</ENAMEX> on another novel , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Departed Soul</ENAMEX> , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shuang - tzu</ENAMEX> .
For her , the biggest source of pressure as a writer is the obligation to " finish . "
In order to reduce this pressure she starts with a disclaimer :
" Do n't ask me how it 's progressing .
If you do n't see any more installments then maybe there wo n't be any more . "
Most cyber-authors are used to writing directly online , which inevitably makes for some clunky sentences and continuity breaks .
Revisions are always needed before online works can be turned into real books , but the writers are still happy writing the way they do at present .
" I wo n't change the way I release my work , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi Chi</ENAMEX> , " because it was the web environment that got me writing in the first place . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Chih - heng</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shuang - tzu</ENAMEX> feel the same way .
So far , the critical reception for cyber-literature in book form has not been great , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Chih - heng</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi Chi</ENAMEX> both bear in mind .
Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai</ENAMEX> : " The success is just a matter of good luck .
I 'll still do what I originally wanted to do - teach at university - and I 'll write as much as I feel I need to . "
On the other hand , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shuang - tzu</ENAMEX> , who graduated in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> literature from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hua Fan University</ENAMEX> , does have literary ambitions .
" I do n't want to categorize my own works , just so long as they are ' understandable . '
I 'm interested in writing bona fide literature , but writing is n't going to be my main profession because I know that economic pressures can get in the way of natural creativity . "
In cyber-literature , casual writing , endless dialogue and wacky goings - on are the norm .
If someone writes it , someone else will read it .
As to the literary merits of the form and whether it will determine the course for literature in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming century</ENAMEX> , that 's not something that unduly concerns the cyber-authors .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Chih - heng</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi - chi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shuang - tzu</ENAMEX> all agree , regardless of fame , they themselves are still free spirits in cyberspace .
