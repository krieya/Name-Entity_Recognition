After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</ENAMEX> of booming business with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , foreign traders are bracing for the biggest slump in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</ENAMEX> .
The imposition of austerity measures , starting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last October</ENAMEX> , already had begun to pinch when the massacre in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 4</ENAMEX> and subsequent events tugged the belt far tighter .
Foreign lending has been virtually suspended since then , choking liquidity and hobbling many projects .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies , leaving many domestic buyers and export - oriented plants strapped for cash .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Givaudan Far East Ltd.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Swiss</ENAMEX> concern that sells chemicals to shampoo and soap factories in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , typifies the problems .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year 's</ENAMEX> retrenchment dried up the working capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> factories .
The company 's sales flattened during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989 's first half</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> killings magnified the problems .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Givaudan</ENAMEX> 's representative office received no orders in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> .
At first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions , but when no orders were logged in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Lai</ENAMEX> became convinced that business would be bad for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">many months</ENAMEX> .
`` Things have grown worse since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 4</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lai</ENAMEX> says .
He predicts that sales will drop <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 30 % and 40 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 million</ENAMEX> .
The consumer - products and light - industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's austerity measures , and foreign companies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Givaudan</ENAMEX> that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest .
But in general , all foreign - trading companies are feeling the pinch .
`` The import pie will shrink , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kamm</ENAMEX> , first vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the American Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> trade specialist .
`` On the down side , sales could fall <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 90 %</ENAMEX> for some companies ; on the upper side , sales will be flat . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's foreign trade has gone in cycles during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</ENAMEX> .
The last time that traders experienced a trough was during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985 - 86</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> imposed tough measures to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange .
The current trough is expected to be much deeper , because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> has cut off domestic funds from factories for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time to slow inflation .
In addition , the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> killings have been a big setback .
`` The freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Wong</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mannesmann AG</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> machinery - trading company .
Import growth from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year - earlier months</ENAMEX> slowed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.1 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , compared with an average growth rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first eight months of 1989</ENAMEX> , imports grew <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21 %</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38.32 billion</ENAMEX> , down slightly from a growth rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> .
The picture for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's exports is just as bleak , mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze .
Exports in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first eight months</ENAMEX> grew <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 9 %</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 31.48 billion</ENAMEX> , compared with a growth rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> customs figures .
The threat to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's balance of payments is further aggravated by the plunge in its foreign - exchange reserves , excluding gold holdings .
The reserves dropped for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April</ENAMEX> .
The trend has prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> to intensify efforts to curb imports .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade</ENAMEX> set up a special bureau <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> to monitor the issue of import and export licenses .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> 's periodic clampdowns on imports have taught many trading companies that the best way to get through the drought is by helping <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> export .
For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissho Iwai Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> trading houses , now buys almost twice as many goods from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> as it sells to that country .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Three years ago</ENAMEX> , the ratio was reversed .
But the strategy is n't helping much this time .
`` Both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masahiko Kitamura</ENAMEX> , general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nissho Iwai 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canton</ENAMEX> office .
He expects the company 's trading business to drop <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 40 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">a short time after June 4</ENAMEX> , it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright .
Many foreign trading offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> were swamped with telexes and telephone calls from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> trade officials urging them not to sever ties .
Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bank of China</ENAMEX> , which normally took <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</ENAMEX> to process letters of credit , was settling the letters at record speed to dispel rumors about the bank 's financial health .
But when foreign traders tried to do business , they discovered that the eagerness of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> trade officials was just a smokescreen .
The suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's national trading companies , which are among the country 's biggest importers .
Business is n't any better on the provincial or municipal level , foreign traders say .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shanghai Investment -AMP- Trust Co.</ENAMEX> , known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sitco</ENAMEX> , is the city 's main financier for trading business .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sitco</ENAMEX> had customarily tapped the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> bond market for funds , but it ca n't do that any longer .
Foreign traders say the company is strapped for cash .
`` It has difficulties paying its foreign debts , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> executive who is familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sitco</ENAMEX> 's business .
`` How can it make available funds for purchases ? ''
Foreign traders also say many of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's big infrastructural projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Lee</ENAMEX> , a veteran trader who specializes in machinery sales , estimates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as many as 70 %</ENAMEX> of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have been canceled in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</ENAMEX> .
`` There are virtually no new projects , and that means no new business for us , '' he says .
Even when new lending resumes , foreign exchange would still be tight because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> will likely try to rein in foreign borrowing , which has grown <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 30 % and 40 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</ENAMEX> .
And foreign creditors are likely to be more cautious about extending new loans because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is nearing a peak repayment period as many loans start falling due in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next two to five years</ENAMEX> .
Another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include steel , chemical fertilizers and plastics .
These have been among the country 's leading imports , particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> when there were shortages that led many traders to buy heavily and pay dearly .
But the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices .
To stem speculation , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> imposed ceiling prices that went into effect <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> .
Traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling do n't want to take a loss on resales and are holding onto their stock .
The resulting stockpiling has depressed the market .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> ca n't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without hampering the country 's export business .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kamm</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> trade expert , estimates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 50 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> 's exports is made up of processed imported raw materials .
