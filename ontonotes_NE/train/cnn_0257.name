<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Tens of thousands</ENAMEX> of additional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> troops are getting ready to join coalition forces fighting the war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> departures are already underway at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort Hood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Kolbe</ENAMEX> is there reporting , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie</ENAMEX> on these families who are saying good-bye to their loved ones .
Reporter :
And this is a military town , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy</ENAMEX> and little by little we are seeing these soldiers head out .
In a strange way and this may sound unusual , there 's a little sense of relief because these soldiers were set to leave in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> and now they got second deployment orders , the delay , of course , the inability to get access to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> , but along the way , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the 4th Infantry Division</ENAMEX> is one steeped in tradition and there 's a real sense of pride among the soldiers , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</ENAMEX> of which left <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
Over the course of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</ENAMEX> will be leaving from here , another <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort Carson</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> and it dates back to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> .
Their equipment that left on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> is now on a ship on its way south through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Suez Canal</ENAMEX> and it 's interesting to note some of the equipment that 's been held up for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of months</ENAMEX> , there are some <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</ENAMEX> helicopters , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</ENAMEX> tanks as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bradley</ENAMEX> infantry fighting vehicles .
These are highly trained soldiers .
They are ready to go .
They are happy to be finally able to come and back up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> wave of troops that left from here .
Their mission is very broad , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy</ENAMEX> to deploy anywhere in the world in support of national strategy .
They do 'nt know what they 'll be doing .
They will learn that once they get there .
Their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> stop will be to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Central Command</ENAMEX> .
They 'll receive more specific orders .
They will be joined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the First Cavalry</ENAMEX> .
They have received deployment orders .
They have not yet been told to make final arrangements .
They all tell me , the soldiers you talk to and also some of the information people here at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort Hood</ENAMEX> , they train like they fight .
They are ready , they are determined and they are very patriotic in support of our country .
They are going over there to do a mission they believe in and as we said , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
They were armed with their Ms , they are concerned .
Their families were here to see them off , but they are determined to return though it is interesting to note that many of them , so many with young children have told their kids that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mom</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX> could be away for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">as long as a year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy</ENAMEX> ?
It 's -- I do n't think we can say it often enough , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie</ENAMEX> .
It 's got --
