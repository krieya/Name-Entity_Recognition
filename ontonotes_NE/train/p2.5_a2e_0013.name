Our banks used to be and still are the most profitable in the world .
Because the people are <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> and do not accept interest from their bank accounts , this interest goes to the banks .
After I read some bank publications about its outrageous profits in <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">the billions of dollars</ENAMEX> , mostly from loans with exorbitant interest rates with which they controlled the citizens ' salaries for many years to come , I am prompted to ask : Have you ever seen a charitable hospital for the citizens built by one of these banks ?
Have you seen a road or a street or a bridge or a dam built at the expense of a bank ?
Have you seen a school or a university built at the expense of a bank ?
Have you seen a mass marriage ceremony at the expense of a bank ?
Have you seen an interest - free loan to help a young man get married , or study , or work coming from a bank ?
Have you heard about treatment of a citizen at the expense of a bank ?
Have you heard about awareness programs against corruption and drugs , support for the Ministry of Interior , and donations to eliminate them ?
All we have seen from the exploiters of the people is -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> interest loans -RRB and control of citizens ' salaries for many years to come .
We have heard nothing about their donations except for -LRB- a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">mosque</ENAMEX> and a facility to wash the dead -RRB- donated by -LRB- al - Rajihi -RRB- out of the thousands of millions that he possesses in most cities .
We say , " May <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> reward him . "
He is the best of the worst when it comes to donations .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">mosques</ENAMEX> are everywhere and there is no shortage .
The state has been and still is building <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">mosques</ENAMEX> , but the nation needs to build <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">hospitals</ENAMEX> , and to donate medicines and equipment , such as dialysis and heart equipment .
The nation needs to build universities and schools , construct roads , help the unemployed , widows , orphans , and divorcees , rehabilitate and assist the handicapped , and eliminate unemployment , spinsterhood , drugs and corruption .
You owners of banks , may <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> take away his blessings from you ...
How much have you profited and consumed from this nation ?
How often have you been ungrateful , criticized , done injustice , and afflicted misery on this nation and its people ?
