The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Peugeot</ENAMEX> metalworkers began filing out of the shop , which makes auto parts , at the plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mulhouse</ENAMEX> after voting <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">589</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">193</ENAMEX> to abandon the occupation .

The strike by customs officers , tax collectors , treasury workers and other civil servants attached to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Finance</ENAMEX> may pose a more serious challenge to the government and the average <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Frenchman</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ministry</ENAMEX> employees complain that they are poorly paid because of a complex job - rating system they say fails to take into account their education and level of technical expertise .
