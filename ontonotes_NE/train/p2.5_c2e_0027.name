As for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX> being " forgotten even by the common people " , " scholars who study <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> politics " will probably have to patiently wait for a period of time .
Furthermore that period of time might still be very long and I do n't think it 's something we can do anything about .
If we make the " symbol of a society 's progress " a country 's founding leaders being forgotten by their own citizens to the extent that they are " forgotten even by the common people " , then , first of all , I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> would n't be able to do it ,
We can not imagine that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> , for the sake of " social progress " , would render <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Washington</ENAMEX> " forgotten even by the common people " .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's capital would have to change its name .
At least <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> does n't have a " <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX> City " .
I think on the contrary that it 's not whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX> has been " forgotten even by the common people " , but rather that certain people and certain powers are too anxious and too impatient .
Each time <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 9</ENAMEX> comes around , they unaccountably fix their gaze on the " trend " in " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's official media " and then make a fuss over it ,
Does n't this illustrate perfectly that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX> can in no way be " forgotten even by the common people " ,
That 's because those people who fervently hope that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX> will be " forgotten even by the common people " are forever unable to let go themselves ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Twenty - eight</ENAMEX> years after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX> died , some venerate him and some curse him ,
Regardless of whether it is voices of eulogy or words uttered in curse , it all shows that in the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX> is a great man who can not be forgotten .
So what is this about being " forgotten even by the common people ? "
