S did indeed buy herself a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yankees</ENAMEX> cap and a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</ENAMEX> house and the next senator from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> will be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelly</ENAMEX> standing by in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> where it will be a joyous affair .
As you announced that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> is calling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Rodham Clinton</ENAMEX> as the next senator of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , the crowd behind me burst into cheers , the band started playing , and the party here has begun .
To tell you some of the story behind the numbers that will send <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Rodham Clinton</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> , let me tell you what some of our exit polling data seems to suggest .
As far as a gender gap , voters who said they voted for Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58 %</ENAMEX> of them women , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47 %</ENAMEX> men .
Now on the big issue the people thought would be the heart of this race , the notion that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> was accused of being a carpet bagger , a woman born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> , made much of her professional life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> and of of course has been living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , voters said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52 %</ENAMEX> of them , that that issue did not matter to them at all .
Also an important constituency for Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> vote .
It appears she has earned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> vote .
This has been a tough race , too , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Lazio</ENAMEX> , the congressman of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Long Island</ENAMEX> was accused of being much more tough as a campaigner --
A lot of mud was slung on both sides of this race , but when voters were questioned about that , they said -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68 %</ENAMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lazio</ENAMEX> attacked unfairly , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57 %</ENAMEX> said Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> did .
So that 's some of the picture that makes up the results tonight that sent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Rodham Clinton</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian</ENAMEX> ?
All right , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelly O'Donnell</ENAMEX> , thank you very much .
And about just how this vote went the way it did <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forrest Sawyer</ENAMEX> standing by with a look behind the numbers , really .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forrest</ENAMEX> ?
A few more of those numbers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelly</ENAMEX> was talking about for you to look at , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian</ENAMEX> .
As she mentioned , men and women did split their vote .
Let 's look at <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> voters .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> know that this was a huge battle over support for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and whether the support for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> was strong enough .
As you look at this , though , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> voters went by a big margin for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Lazio 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> remember the campaign debate where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Lazio</ENAMEX> walked over to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> and said you 're going to sign this pledge about campaign moneys , you 're going to sign it .
That .
Was she attacked unfairly , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68 %</ENAMEX> did say yes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57 %</ENAMEX> went for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> , and as for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lazio</ENAMEX> 's voters , a lot of people said this was a campaign about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Lazio</ENAMEX> is this other guy .
In fact they asked of his voters , how many voted against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> --
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> said we 're voting against her , we 're not voting for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Lazio</ENAMEX> , we 're voting against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> , and that shows you that , in fact , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> pointed out , she really is a tremendous lightning rod .
This campaign was about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> , do you like her or do you not .
Scombrort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> voters were voting for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> , not against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Lazio</ENAMEX> , and on the which one attacked the other more unfairly , the voters said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lazio</ENAMEX> attacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> more unfairly , and that possibly played into the gap in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> vote , which is heavily in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> .
In addition to the scene that you mentioned , the debate , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lazio</ENAMEX> was -- invaded her space , as they say , he hit very hard in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two weeks</ENAMEX> on issues involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> campaign , not directly through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lazio</ENAMEX> , but others was actually associating in certain ways Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> 's sympathies with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> sides in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> with the attack on the battle ship <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> .
It got out of hand and so this vote could well be as much a rejection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lazio</ENAMEX> campaign as it is also a very positive setting about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> 's numbers , and you remember after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Lazio</ENAMEX> had pressed her right in front of the debate crowd , they said What do you think of this and women said It reminds me of my husband or in some cases my ex-husband and I do n't like it and we see that women and particularly working women went by a large measure for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> , there is this as well .
Opinions about her husband appear to have been important in voters ' decisions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 / 3</ENAMEX> approve of the job that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> is doing as President .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> won that group <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</ENAMEX> .
Among those who disapprove of her husband , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lazio</ENAMEX> won <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</ENAMEX> , and it 's certainly a different kind of race from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moynihan</ENAMEX> races we 've grown accustomed to where the question was would he get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68 %</ENAMEX> of the vote or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69 %</ENAMEX> of the vote .
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> has come out on top by a very wide margin .
Thank you .
