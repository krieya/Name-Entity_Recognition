<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Computer Associates International Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garden City</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> said they agreed to jointly develop software to help manage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vax</ENAMEX> computers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Computer Associates</ENAMEX> has carved out a huge business selling such software for use in managing networks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> computers but needs to find new markets if it is to maintain its growth rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> and more <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</ENAMEX> .
The market for system - management software for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> 's hardware is fragmented enough that a giant such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Computer Associates</ENAMEX> should do well there .
At the same time , the market is smaller than the market for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> - compatible software .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maynard</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , has sold fewer machines .
In addition , its machines are typically easier to operate , so customers require less assistance from software .
