In what may have been a ripple effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> crisis , an explosion <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> killed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</ENAMEX> sailors on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">US Navy</ENAMEX> destroyer in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> port of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> investigators are going to the scene but in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the White House</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the State Department</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> officials are already expressing suspicions that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's explosion was an act of terrorism .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">World</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark Boyd</ENAMEX> reports .
The blast , which occurred <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">just after noon</ENAMEX> local time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> , ripped a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> x <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 foot</ENAMEX> gash in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the USS Cole</ENAMEX> , a state - of - the - art destroyer that had stopped in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> to refuel before joining the carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">George Washington</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> .
Speaking at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> 's home base in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norfolk</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> , Admiral <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Foley</ENAMEX> said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> is investigating the incident .
I do n't know whether it was terrorism or not .
It was an act of certainly a severe belligerence but we do n't know the source , nor can I comment any further on that .
But in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> officials went further saying that they had every reason to suspect that the blast was caused by terrorists .
The officials said that reports from the scene , including <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> from an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Army</ENAMEX> officer working in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Aden Harbor</ENAMEX> , suggested that a small rubber craft that was helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> dock came alongside the destroyer and caused the blast .
Many , including retired Admiral <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene Carroll</ENAMEX> , are suspicious that the small boat may have been loaded with high - power explosives and that the attack was planned .
That craft that approached the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> is a rubber boat , not a big craft , but they would have had to pack it fully with explosives to do the amount of damage that they did to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> and that certainly would have taken time to get that put together .
While both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> dispatched teams of experts to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> to investigate the explosion , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged caution saying it was too early to jump to any conclusions .
Still , she promised that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> would take appropriate action if terrorists were found to be behind the blast , a sentiment echoed <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">later in the day</ENAMEX> by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> .
If , as it now appears , this was an act of terrorism , it was a despicable and cowardly act .
We will find out who is responsible and hold them accountable .
If their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> , they will fail utterly .
For some terrorism experts <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's attack , which occurred against the backdrop of intense clashes between <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> , has an eerily familiar ring to it .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Hoffman</ENAMEX> is the director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Rand Corporation 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> office .
We have seen often in the past how violence and conflict and tensions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> often embroil <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> .
One only has to recall the bombing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">US Marine</ENAMEX> barracks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</ENAMEX> , also <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</ENAMEX> before presidential election , also at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> was involving suitable ferment at that point in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> now with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> was also attempting actively to provide some stabilizing influence and unfortunately and tragically got caught up in the maelstrom and that seems to be the salient fact of this attack .
And if this attack turns out to be the work of terrorists , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX> says it would signal a dangerous new trend .
Maritime or marine - borne terrorist attacks are actually quite rare .
That being said it could well be the beginning of a new pattern .
We have made it far more difficult , appropriately so , for terrorists to attack our ground forces in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Arabian Peninsula</ENAMEX> .
So , I think terrorists prevented from attacking their targets using their more conventional means ` truck bombs ' have merely adjusted their tactics slightly and obviously they have been successful with it <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> TV <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> the country 's President expressed his heart - felt condolences to those who were killed and injured , but denied that the explosion on board the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cole</ENAMEX> was caused by terrorists , although , admits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Al - Qadhi</ENAMEX> , editor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yemen Observer</ENAMEX> newspaper in the capital <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sana</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="5">anti-American</ENAMEX> sentiment has been running high in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> because of events in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> .
The people now in the streets are gathering because they feel that not just as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> , as human beings , that what is happening in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> is not humanitarian .
Regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States '</ENAMEX> attitude in this regard , we find that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> until now are supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> .
The people here feel that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> should do something .
With tensions running high throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's incident off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> serves as a warning .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> armed forces and diplomatic personnel might be on high alert for sometime to come .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The World</ENAMEX> this is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark Boyd</ENAMEX> .
