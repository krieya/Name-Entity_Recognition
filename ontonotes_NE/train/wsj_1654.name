For retailers , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</ENAMEX> , not <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Halloween</ENAMEX> , promises to be <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year 's spookiest season</ENAMEX> .
Many retailers fear a price war will erupt if cash - strapped companies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> slash tags to spur sales .
Concerns about the stock market , doubts about the economy in general and rising competition from catalog companies also haunt store operators .
`` Profits at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</ENAMEX> could be under attack for every retailer , '' asserts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Abramson</ENAMEX> , president and chief operating officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Clothestime Inc.</ENAMEX> , an off - price chain .
Even if there is n't any widespread discounting , the outlook for industry profits is n't good .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Management Horizons</ENAMEX> forecasts a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.4 %</ENAMEX> profit decline for non-auto retailers <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> drops that averaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.5 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> .
`` For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two and a half years</ENAMEX> , retailing has been in a mild recession , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Steidtmann</ENAMEX> , chief economist at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , consulting firm .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</ENAMEX> , many stores are entering <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the Christmas season</ENAMEX> in turmoil : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bonwit Teller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">B. Altman</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">L.J. Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX> is operating under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">B.A.T Industries PLC 's</ENAMEX> healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Marshall Field 's</ENAMEX> chains are on the auction block ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campeau</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX> 's is also on the block .
Industry observers expect a wide divergence in performance .
Stores in a state of confusion are likely to fare poorly , and to lose customers to stable chains such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Limited Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">May Department Stores Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dillard Department Stores Inc.</ENAMEX> , which should do well .
`` There are going to be very clear winners and very clear losers , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia Turk</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Touche Ross -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> retail consultant .
Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steidtmann</ENAMEX> : `` I 'm looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a bi-polar Christmas</ENAMEX> . ''
Economists expect general merchandise sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth quarter</ENAMEX> to rise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.5 % to 6 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year - ago</ENAMEX> figures .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steidtmann</ENAMEX> predicts that healthy stores hawking mostly apparel could ring up gains of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 25 % to 30 %</ENAMEX> .
Troubled chains could see their sales drop <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 8 %</ENAMEX> , he believes , as managers distracted by fears about the future allow their stores to get sloppy .
Thin merchandise selections at the most troubled chains are also expected to hurt sales .
Catalog companies are likely to pose a bigger threat to all stores <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 200</ENAMEX> catalog outfits are promoting a low - cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Express</ENAMEX> service that guarantees <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">pre-Christmas</ENAMEX> delivery of orders made by a certain date .
`` Traditionally , consumers were concerned about ordering after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> because they did n't believe they would get it by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam Strum</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Wine Enthusiast Inc.</ENAMEX> , which sells wine cellars and accessories through the mail .
Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Express</ENAMEX> delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strum</ENAMEX> says , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">our biggest month</ENAMEX> . ''
Even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sears , Roebuck -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> is getting into the act , offering for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Express</ENAMEX> deliver toys ordered by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 20</ENAMEX> from its <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wish Book</ENAMEX> catalog .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">K mart Corp.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph E. Antonini</ENAMEX> summed up his outlook for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the Christmas season</ENAMEX> as `` not troublesome . ''
He 's not predicting a blockbuster , but he is `` more optimistic than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three months ago</ENAMEX> '' because employment remains strong and inflation low .
Other retailers are also preparing for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a ho - hum holiday</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip M. Hawley</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.</ENAMEX> , expects sales at department stores open <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at least a year</ENAMEX> to rise a modest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 % to 5 %</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year 's</ENAMEX> totals , both for his company and the industry in general .
`` I 'm not looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a runaway Christmas</ENAMEX> at all , '' he says .
`` It is n't <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a real boom holiday season</ENAMEX> in our eyes , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Woolworth Corp.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold E. Sells</ENAMEX> , `` but it is n't going to be a bust either . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sells</ENAMEX> expects <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fourth - quarter</ENAMEX> sales at his company -- which besides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Woolworth</ENAMEX> stores includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kinney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Foot Locker</ENAMEX> shoe stores and other specialty chains -- to rise `` pretty much in line '' with its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year - to - date</ENAMEX> increases of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 8 % and 9 %</ENAMEX> .
The estimate includes the results of new stores .
A consumer poll conducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early September</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Leo J. Shapiro -AMP- Associates</ENAMEX> , a market researcher based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> , also suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a modest holiday</ENAMEX> .
Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</ENAMEX> survey respondents , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</ENAMEX> said they expect to spend less buying <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</ENAMEX> gifts <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</ENAMEX> said they expect to spend more and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37 %</ENAMEX> said their gift budget would stay the same .
The results are almost identical to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shapiro</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1988</ENAMEX> numbers .
Retailers could get a boost <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> from the calendar .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</ENAMEX> falls on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a Monday</ENAMEX> , creating a big <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last - minute</ENAMEX> weekend opportunity for stores .
Most will stay open <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">late Saturday night</ENAMEX> and open their doors again <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> .
But many consumers probably will use the extra time to put off some purchasing until <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the last minute</ENAMEX> .
`` What you 'll hear as we get into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> is that sales are sluggish , '' predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Woolworth</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sells</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">The week ending the 24th</ENAMEX> is going to save <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the entire month</ENAMEX> for everyone .
