Regarding your <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 28</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Politics -AMP- Policy</ENAMEX> column on the party differences over cutting capital gains or expanding IRAs : Why not compromise now and save the public from the coming infantile congressional political rhetoric that seems to go hand in hand with the process ?
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> maintain that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> capital - gains exclusion will raise revenue in the short term and spur economic investment , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> maintain that an increase in the top income - tax rate and expanded IRAs will raise revenue and spur savings .
This is a classic example of the old saying , `` The whole is greater than the sum of its parts . ''
It 's ridiculous for a family with taxable income of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">50,000</ENAMEX> to pay the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</ENAMEX> incremental tax rate as a family with taxable income of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">250,000</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</ENAMEX> bracket should apply to all income over the applicable level , not just the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> rate adjustment amount .
It 's equally ridiculous not to provide a capital investment or retirement - savings tax incentive .
