The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> said it plans to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 billion</ENAMEX> in notes and bonds <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> , but said the auctions will be postponed unless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> acts quickly to lift the federal debt ceiling .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Basham</ENAMEX> , deputy assistant secretary for federal finance , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> may wait until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Monday</ENAMEX> or even <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early Tuesday</ENAMEX> to announce whether the autions are to be rescheduled .

Without congressional action , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> ca n't sell any new securities -- even savings bonds .
But despite partisan bickering over the debt ceiling , which has become entangled in the fight over cutting capital - gains taxes , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> is almost certain to act in time to avoid default .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Each day</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> fails to act ... will cause additional disruption in our borrowing schedule , possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the taxpayer , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> said in a speech prepared for delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</ENAMEX> to a group of bankers .
`` To avoid these costs , and a possible default , immediate action is imperative . ''
The securities to be sold <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> will raise <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 10 billion</ENAMEX> in cash and redeem <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 billion</ENAMEX> in maturing notes .

They will mature <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 21</ENAMEX> .
None of the securities will be eligible for when - issued trading until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> approves an increase in the debt ceiling , clearing the way for a formal offering , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basham</ENAMEX> said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> said it needs to raise <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 47.5 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the current quarter</ENAMEX> in order to end <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 billion</ENAMEX> cash balance .
Auctions held in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> and those scheduled for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> will raise a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25.6 billion</ENAMEX> .
The remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21.9 billion</ENAMEX> could be raised through the sale of short - term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> notes in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year</ENAMEX> notes in early <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> said .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first three months</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> estimates that it will have to raise <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 45 billion and $ 50 billion</ENAMEX> , assuming that it decides to aim for a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</ENAMEX> cash balance at the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March</ENAMEX> .
