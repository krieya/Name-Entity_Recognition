According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr. Liu</ENAMEX> , children who are bullied in schools is a possible reflection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> social norm of the strong bullying the weak ; in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> are in a weaker position , so they are easily the target of bullies , and the same applies to children :
" Look , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , a superior bullies his subordinates , a senior bullies a junior , and these simply are very normal cases ; therefore bullying others is something born and bred natively in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> . "
Facing the issue of their children being bullied , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> parents have also raised different opinions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Hong</ENAMEX> , who lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bunkyo - ku</ENAMEX> district , said , " When children are bullied in school , parents should not dismiss it ; rather , they should immediately contact the teachers and other parents ' support groups so as to resolve the issue through communications ; at the same time , they have to clearly remember not to get into an argument , as this would be counter-productive . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Lee</ENAMEX> , who already has <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</ENAMEX> children , said , " Whether the children are easily bulled in school or not also depends on the social skills of the parents . "
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> parents themselves could not blend into <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> society , and even try to avoid contact with other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> upon seeing them ; under such a situation , how could their children blend in ?
Parents themselves are mirrors of their children 's growth , so we ourselves have to step out and make friends , so that our children can voluntarily make friends with other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> children .
When they have friends , they wo n't be so easily bullied .
