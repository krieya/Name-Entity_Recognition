<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of the more bizarre garden stories since <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eden</ENAMEX> has been unfolding for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> now , in the private paper - and - crayon fantasies of artist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Bartlett</ENAMEX> .
And if she and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Battery Park City Authority</ENAMEX> have their way , her horticulturally inept plan will soon go public as a real garden `` artwork '' in the downtown complex .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South Gardens</ENAMEX> , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> scheme is called , will occupy the last <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.5 acres</ENAMEX> of open space at the southwest tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> .
It could cost taxpayers <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</ENAMEX> to install and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">BPC</ENAMEX> residents <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</ENAMEX> a year to maintain .
Created by an artist who flaunts her ignorance of plants and gardens , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South Gardens</ENAMEX> , as now planned , will die from congestive garden design .
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> 's previous work , which earned her an international reputation in the non-horticultural art world , often took gardens as its nominal subject .
Mayhap this metaphorical connection made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the BPC Fine Arts Committee</ENAMEX> think she had a literal green thumb .
-LRB- Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> would not discuss her garden for this article . -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> she boasted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">HG</ENAMEX> magazine : `` I 'd never looked at a garden in my life . ''
And she proved no shirking violet in her initial statement to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BPCA</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York State</ENAMEX> public benefit corporation : `` The only thing I was interested in doing was a very complicated garden , which would cost an enormous amount of money and be very expensive to maintain . ''
Undeterred , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BPCA</ENAMEX> hired Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> and another confessed garden ignoramus , the architect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Cooper</ENAMEX> , who claimed he had never visited , much less built , a garden , and said of the project , `` I do n't view this as a landscape .
I view this as a building . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> principal in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South Gardens</ENAMEX> adventure did have garden experience .
The firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bruce Kelly / David Varnell Landscape Architects</ENAMEX> had created <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Central Park 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strawberry Fields</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare Garden</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BPCA</ENAMEX> called its team a `` stunning '' collaboration .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> , though , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South Gardens</ENAMEX> design is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</ENAMEX> uncollaborated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Bartlett</ENAMEX> .
She has done little more than recycle her standard motifs -- trees , water , landscape fragments , rudimentary square houses , circles , triangles , rectangles -- and fit them into a grid , as if she were making one of her gridded two - dimensional works for a gallery wall .
But for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South Gardens</ENAMEX> , the grid was to be a 3 - D network of masonry or hedge walls with real plants inside them .
In a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BPCA</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">kelly / varnell</ENAMEX> called this `` arbitrary and amateurish . ''
The landscape architects were expelled from the garden in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> .
All the while , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> had been busy at her assignment , serene in her sense of self - tilth .
As she put it in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> lecture at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Harvard Graduate School of Design</ENAMEX> : `` I have designed a garden , not knowing the difference between a rhododendron and a tulip . ''
Moreover , she proclaimed that `` landscape architects have been going wrong for the last <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</ENAMEX> '' in the design of open space .
And she further stunned her listeners by revealing her secret garden design method : Commissioning a friend to spend `` <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">five or six thousand dollars</ENAMEX> ... on books that I ultimately cut up . ''
After that , the layout had been easy .
`` I 've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail . ''
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client `` because I do n't think you can do watered - down versions of things . ''
-LRB- This was never a problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South Gardens</ENAMEX> , because the client had long since given in to Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> 's every whim . -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> the public was afforded a preview of Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> 's creation in a tablemodel version , at a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">BPC</ENAMEX> exhibition .
The labels were breathy : `` Within its sheltering walls is a microcosm of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a thousand years</ENAMEX> in garden design ... a rose garden , herb garden , serpentine garden , flower fields , an apple orchard ... organized in a patchwork of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 - by - 50 - foot</ENAMEX> squares to form ` rooms ' ... here and there are simple architectural forms , a whimsical jet of water , a conceit of topiary or tartan plaid , and chairs of every sort to drag around ... .
At the core of it all is a love for plants . ''
Plant lovers who studied the maquette were alarmed .
They looked at the miniature and saw a giant folly .
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> 's little rooms left little room for plants or people .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kelly / Varnell</ENAMEX> had put <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South Gardens '</ENAMEX> carrying capacity at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> people per room , or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</ENAMEX> humans overall .
This mincemeat of tiny gridlocked squares was inspired by the artist 's own digs : `` My loft was <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 by 100 feet</ENAMEX> , so <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 feet by 50 feet</ENAMEX> seemed like a good garden room . ''
Inside the grid were <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</ENAMEX> of these plant cells jammed full of clutter .
One she made into a topiary rec room , replete with plants shaped into a Barcalounger , TV , piano and chairs .
In another , she requisitioned topiary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MX</ENAMEX> missile cones -- costing $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000</ENAMEX> each -- in heights up to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 feet</ENAMEX> .
Another she stuffed with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> `` rectilinear hedges '' for a topiary geometry lesson in the right - angling of plants .
In the herbal lounge she specified a `` plaid knot garden '' decor .
She ordered the foyer done in a different plaid planting , and made the landscape architects study a book on tartans .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> garden roomette she implanted <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a 43 - foot square glass cube</ENAMEX> meant to show off a plaid tile floor conceit , a `` zinc sink , '' a `` huge fishbowl with carp '' and a `` birdcage with cockatoos . ''
Next door she put a smaller plaid - floored glass house , where , she suggested , a flat of strawberries might be displayed in the dead of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</ENAMEX> .
In another compartment called <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Linden Bosque</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</ENAMEX> linden trees were to be crowded together at killing intervals of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 or 16 feet</ENAMEX> .
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lindens</ENAMEX> need <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 36 feet</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
One thing about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> plan was never in doubt : It would demand the full - time skills of a battalion of topiary barbers , rosarians , orchardists and arborists .
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> blithely suggested calling upon `` semi-skilled garden club workers for maintenance . ''
Furthermore , she had insisted on paths so narrow -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five to eight feet</ENAMEX> -RRB- and hedge corners so square that standard maintenance equipment -- trucks or cherry pickers -- could n't maneuver .
Then , to make these gardenettes quite literally rooms , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> had thrown up windowless walls -LRB- brick , lattice , hedge -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 feet</ENAMEX> tall , casting her interiors into day - long Stygian shade .
It was hard to see how photosynthesis would ever happen in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South Gardens</ENAMEX> without decking the walls in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</ENAMEX> - like array of Gro - Lites .
Finally , flouting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BPCA</ENAMEX> 's wishes to continue the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two - mile</ENAMEX> riverside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Esplanade</ENAMEX> , prized for its expansive views of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">New York Harbor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Statue of Liberty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Ellis Island</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> threw up yet another wall , this time concrete , this time <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 1/2 feet</ENAMEX> tall .
She ran it the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South Gardens</ENAMEX> riverfront , blotting out the city 's great natural water features , the harbor and the river .
-LRB- Within her garden , she has decreed a waterfall , a rill , ponds and other costly , trivial waterworks beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Hudson</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
While the model was still on view , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manhattan Community Board 1</ENAMEX> passed a resolution against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South Gardens</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Parks Council</ENAMEX> wrote the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BPCA</ENAMEX> that this `` too ` private ' ... exclusive , '' complex and expensive `` enclosed garden ... belongs in almost any location but the waterfront . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynden B. Miller</ENAMEX> , the noted public garden designer who restored <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Central Park 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Conservatory Garden</ENAMEX> , recalls her reaction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South Gardens</ENAMEX> model in light of the public garden she was designing for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">42nd Street 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bryant Park</ENAMEX> : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bryant Park</ENAMEX> , as designed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</ENAMEX> , failed as a public space , because it made people feel trapped .
By removing the hedges and some walls , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bryant Park Restoration</ENAMEX> is opening it up .
It seems to me the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BPCA</ENAMEX> plan has the potential of making <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South Gardens</ENAMEX> a horticultural jail for people and plants . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> urban horticulture experts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cornell Cooperative Extension</ENAMEX> weighed in with a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BPCA</ENAMEX> that began : `` We feel that the garden is horticulturally doomed . ''
They then addressed the decidedly `` questionable safety of ... a complex garden of endless hiding places .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</ENAMEX> ft. hedges which obstruct views in and out of small ` rooms ' insure ... that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime . ''
-LRB- At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvard</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> had declared : `` There are going to be problems with safety ...
I 'm not going to address questions of safety ! '' -RRB-
Despite the dire assessments of knowledgeable garden professionals , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South Gardens</ENAMEX> design somehow continues on , seemingly impervious to reason , stalled only by bureaucratic lethargy and logistical complications .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BPCA</ENAMEX> President and CEO <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Emil</ENAMEX> hopes to negotiate a seawall that could `` be significantly more visually permeable . ''
And by substituting yet another landscape architect , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Quennell</ENAMEX> , he insists he can achieve that and other accommodations to gardening reality while still preserving the `` artistic vision '' of a `` truly great artist . ''
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> of no progress in this direction , it is doubtful any viable collaboration with Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> will suddenly now be possible .
-LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quennell</ENAMEX> has said he plans to go with the grid , regardless . -RRB-
There is still time , however , for Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Cuomo</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fabian Palomino</ENAMEX> , chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BPCA</ENAMEX> board , to prevent this topiary `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tilted Arc</ENAMEX> . ''
These statesmen might take counsel from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Robinson</ENAMEX> , author of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The English Flower Garden</ENAMEX> '' -- the gardener 's bible since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1883</ENAMEX> -- who seems to have had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a Jennifer Bartlett</ENAMEX> in mind when he wrote : `` Unhappily , our gardeners for ages have suffered at the hands of the decorative artist when applying his ` designs ' to the garden ... .
It is this adapting of absurd ` knots ' and patterns from old books to any surface where a flower garden has to be made that leads to bad and frivolous design -- wrong in plan and hopeless for the life of plants .
