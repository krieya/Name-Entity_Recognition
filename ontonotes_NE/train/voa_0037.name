<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The US Senate</ENAMEX> has passed the bill allowing food and medicine sales to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> potentially easing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">40 - year - old</ENAMEX> trade sanctions against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communist</ENAMEX> ruled island .
The measure now goes on to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> who said he will sign it .
It allows <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> to buy food and medicine from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</ENAMEX> , but the bill restricts <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> financing of such sales and also continues a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> travel ban to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> .
The bill is meant to ease the trade sanctions , but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> says , the financial conditions will make it impossible to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> food .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Communist Party</ENAMEX> officials have vowed not to spend <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">one cent</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> goods .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel Castro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> led a massive protest rally in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> against the bill 's restrictions .
We have more on that story on our dateline segment <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">later in this hour</ENAMEX> .
