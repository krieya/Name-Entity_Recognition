Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> troops have not had a chance to call home since they were deployed for duty in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Operation Iraqi Freedom</ENAMEX> . ''
For some wives , the kindness of strangers has eased their worries .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beth Basin</ENAMEX> explains .
Reporter :
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie</ENAMEX> 's husband <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> was deployed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks ago</ENAMEX> .
She and her daughter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> often shuffle through these pictures of him taken before he left .
She has no idea where her husband is now , but thanks to a little help from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Delta</ENAMEX> flight attendant , she knew he got where he was going .
She had taken a picture of him and everything .
Reporter :
Along with the picture , the flight attendant wrote a letter saying she was praying for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> 's safe return .
The trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> was just the first leg .
He got on a flight to an undisclosed location , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie</ENAMEX> got a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> phone call from a flight attendant .
He asked us to call you to let you know he 's okay .
And she told us that he whipped out pictures of our kids and everything and showed all the family pictures and stuff .
Reporter :
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie</ENAMEX> is not the only military wife who received a photo and letter .
Her friend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX> also got one .
Turns out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX> 's husband flew out on the same flight as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> .
Although a small gesture , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX> says it 's meant a great deal .
It made me realize that someone out there does care about my husband and the rest of the military , and it 's not all anti-war .
Reporter :
Even though neither of the women have ever met the flight attendants , they say they 'll never forget their act of kindness .
