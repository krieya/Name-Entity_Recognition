-- basically , it was unanimously agreed upon by the various relevant parties .
To express its determination , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> securities regulatory department compares this stock reform to a die that has been cast .
It takes time to prove whether the stock reform can really meet expectations , and whether any deviations that arise during the stock reform can be promptly corrected .
Dear viewers , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">China News</ENAMEX> program will end here .
This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xu Li</ENAMEX> .
Thank you everyone for watching .
Coming up is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Focus Today</ENAMEX> program hosted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Shilin</ENAMEX> .
Good-bye , dear viewers .
Hello , dear viewers .
Welcome to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Focus Today</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , let 's turn our attention to a road cave - in accident that happened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> over the holiday .
Before dawn on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 3</ENAMEX> , a sewage pipe leakage accident occurred at the main and side roads of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jingguang Bridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">East Third Ring Road</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing Municipality</ENAMEX> , resulting in the road caving in .
Relevant departments from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing Municipality</ENAMEX> promptly activated emergency contingency plans .
The traffic administration department carried out traffic supervision near the accident scene .
Well , how did the emergency response mechanisms activated by governmental departments operate effectively during the holiday ?
After the holiday , what will be done to handle citizens ' peak commute ?
In addition , what measures did relevant departments take to resolve issues such as waste discharge , heating , and communication , in order to ensure that the lives of citizens were not affected ?
Well , we have invited <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> honorable guests to the studio <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> to follow this topic with us .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> honorable guests in the studio is Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou Hanhua</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Institute of Law</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</ENAMEX> .
Hello .
Next is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Yang</ENAMEX> , a host of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Beijing Traffic Radio Station</ENAMEX> .
Hello .
Welcome both of you to the studio to participate in our program .
Well , I especially want to know , ha , how the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of you found out the news on the day of the accident ?
Ah , at 11:00 a.m. , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">about 11:00 m. yesterday</ENAMEX> , ah , I happened to find out through an SMS when I was outside .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
It happened that I was going to have lunch with a friend , um , at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</ENAMEX> .
And then , the friend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> sent me an SMS , Uh-huh . saying he would come pick me up to go together .
After that , I received an SMS from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1860</ENAMEX> .
Uh-huh , it was through an SMS .
And you , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Yang</ENAMEX> ?
A friend happened to call me .
You were not at work <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</ENAMEX> ?
No .
The station called me at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</ENAMEX> and said something happened at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jingguang Bridge</ENAMEX> and that I had to go to the station immediately to research the upcoming program .
Uh-huh , that means , er , you found out the accident through an information source at the station .
Right , right , right .
Uh-huh .
Well , like Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou</ENAMEX> , I also received this news , ha , through a mobile phone SMS .
At that time , I , it can be said that this SMS was among the many , ha , SMS containing <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">New Year</ENAMEX> wishes , like Happy <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">New Year</ENAMEX> , received after the start of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the New Year</ENAMEX> .
Uh-huh .
Ah , actually I felt a lot of warmth when I received that SMS .
Although we live in the west instead of the east and it did not affect us much , I think it is very useful , ah , to inform people of this kind of news .
Yes , exceptionally .
Yes , exceptionally .
Well , what in fact was the content of that SMS ?
Let 's take a look via this footage , ha .
I remember the SMS was written like this at that time , saying that , ah , there was a sewage pipe leakage accident on the side road at the southeast corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jingguang Bridge</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">East Third Ring Road</ENAMEX> , and , well , traffic supervision was implemented near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chaoyang Road</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jingguang Bridge</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">East Third Ring Road</ENAMEX> , and requesting cars to make a detour .
Some car owners said that it was very good that the SMS was sent .
Furthermore , there was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> last sentence in that SMS thanking citizens for their cooperation and support .
Ah , after the SMS was sent , I thought , I felt it seems to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing Municipality</ENAMEX> , ah , used an SMS to give notification at the time of a public emergency .
I do n't know , all of us are living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> , is this the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time , Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou</ENAMEX> ?
Yes , in terms of an official notification , this should be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time one was sent officially through <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1860</ENAMEX> .
Uh-huh .
Of course , in private life , people have used SMS countless times to spread news .
Yes .
Other places in the country must have used this too .
Uh-huh , uh-huh .
Must have used this too .
Actually , I remember receiving an SMS like this one <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> before it snowed , since snowfall would affect road conditions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> to a rather large extent .
Uh-huh .
However , it did not give people such a special feeling as it did this time .
Uh-huh .
Ah , when an SMS is sent to inform citizens of such an incident , can it be considered a work method or expression of government information transparency ?
Yes , this is indeed a point especially worth our -- through the very successful response to this emergency , ah , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Beijing Municipality</ENAMEX> , Uh-huh . an extremely good point that is worth pondering deeply , worthy innovation .
Uh-huh .
For instance , previously our news announcements were made through some conventional methods , but this time it was made in the form of a mobile phone SMS .
In fact , this is a method highly emphasized in various countries ' development of e-government .
We usually make it sound like e-government is something unattainable .
Yes , when we talked about e-government in the past , it seemed to be only done through the Internet .
Right .
It seemed that computers , ah , and the Internet , ah , were an expression of e-government , to let people find out information .
Well , presently in fact , e-governments in various countries apply this so - called last mile , ah , or last multiple - exposure method , such as call centers , such as electronic IDs , and such as these , these , these electronic signatures .
These are quite sophisticated forms .
Uh-huh .
In particular , %pw more terminals , such as this , this cable television , ah , this , this digital television , ah , and mobile phone SMS , are applied in e-government .
Hence , I think this is an excellent , a test of e-government because , as I remember , during SARS in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</ENAMEX> , people at that time criticized e-government during the spread of SARS , ah .
Uh-huh .
They said that e-government %pw was very good but was not put into use .
Well , this time I think that a short SMS like this can fully create interaction between the government and the public through this e-government form .
Uh-huh .
Yes .
We drive often in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> , ha , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Yang</ENAMEX> .
If people were not informed of such a traffic accident through SMS on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</ENAMEX> and they continued to head there , what do you think would happen if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear ?
Yes .
Ah , well , I think it would have been real paralysis .
This is the most appropriate word to use .
Furthermore , I think that when SMS was used to announce the news , it should be said to have fit the conditions in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> very well .
Why is that so ?
This is because , it should be said that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is the country with the highest SMS usage .
There are probably not as many chances to use SMS in foreign countries compared with domestically , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , ah .
So , it can be said that penetration was quite high this time , by using the most familiar method , most used by everyone , as well as the most prompt and most convenient method , for the announcement .
Yes , I noticed that many friends around me , around me received it .
It seems that almost everyone received this SMS .
Yes .
Yes .
The effect was extremely good , ha .
So , how exactly did citizens react ?
Let 's take a look at the reactions of citizens .
-- an SMS .
I saw it was <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">that Jingguang Bridge</ENAMEX> .
Hey , I say , this is quite good , quite good .
Have you received information like this before ?
No , no .
This was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time ?
Yes , yes .
Well , what do you think of the speed at which the government responded this time ?
Quite fast .
Really quite fast , ah .
So , I did not drive <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
I set out a bit earlier and took the subway here .
Do you think that the response of the government was fast this time ?
Ah , the response was quite fast .
In addition , various media announcements were also quite prompt .
Colleagues and friends also informed one another by phone calls and SMS .
I think this plan was %pw quite speedy .
It seems that through this kind of SMS , citizens responded very well and the effect was excellent , ha .
Well , apart from the , ah , point on information disclosure brought out by this accident , the fact is that the activation of emergency contingency plans by the , ah , government has also left people with a very deep impression .
Let 's find out the situation at that time through some footage .
Well , we know that after the road cave - in accident , ah , ah , traffic police and emergency rescue personnel rushed to the scene , ah , to direct traffic and carry out emergency repair of sewage pipes .
Well , lots of barricade tape has been strung up on the side road in the north - south direction of the accident scene beneath <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Jingguang Bridge</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">East Third Ring Road</ENAMEX> .
All personnel responsible for the emergency repair of underground sewage pipes , ah , have arrived at their designated locations .
See , through this footage , we see , ah , this --
Uh-huh .
Okay , ah , this , this emergency repair worker said that he was there at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">4 o'clock</ENAMEX> .
That means that they arrived at the scene right after the pre-dawn accident occurred .
Well , it can be said that the traffic administration department was activated very quickly after receiving the news .
Well , ah , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Yang</ENAMEX> , you work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Traffic Radio Station</ENAMEX> , ha , well , and we know that you all gave an extensive live broadcast this morning .
A special program .
Yes , a special program on this traffic .
So , let 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> turn our attention to the impact on traffic after the accident .
Judging from the traffic control measures taken after the accident , as well as the eventual impact caused , what do you think are the effects ?
Actually , concerning this , I think both of you are very familiar with the traffic in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
Previously we had a statistic , especially for the ring roads in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
That is , if we have an ordinary fender bender or tailgate accident on a bridge such as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Jingguang Bridge</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Third Ring Road</ENAMEX> , it might cause the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Third Ring Road</ENAMEX> to have bumper - to - bumper traffic jams during these morning and evening peak periods .
Uh-huh .
It might even impact traffic on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Second Ring Road</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fourth Ring Road</ENAMEX> .
Well , ah , if there is an accident , from the time it occurs until the time all traffic is cleared , it probably takes <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">about half an hour to an hour</ENAMEX> during peak periods .
Well , we could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jingguang Bridge</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Changhong Bridge</ENAMEX> from the south all the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Guomao Bridge</ENAMEX> , blocking the main and side roads .
Well , the situation would be unthinkable during this peak period that is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> day of work for everyone .
Hence , at that time , before <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">6:30 a .m . today</ENAMEX> , before our live broadcast , we moved the broadcast forward , and before the live broadcast we were very worried .
However , actually after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the entire day today</ENAMEX> , I came here right after ending the live broadcast this evening to continue with the live broadcast here , in fact , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> people indeed experienced an extremely high volume of traffic flow on the roads surrounding the section under traffic control , and indeed there was a very big traffic jam .
Uh-huh .
However , the affected area was not as large as expected .
Moreover , some people made detours once they received the news .
Right .
Psychologically , people felt quite relieved .
Because I know this situation .
Right , like those whom we interviewed just now .
It was easy to handle once everyone understood .
Yes , ah , one of the viewers we just interviewed mentioned just now , a citizen , he said , I set out <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> before the incident , and I did not drive after I was informed .
That person did not even drive .
Right .
Actually , in this aspect , I think that citizens were really quite cooperative .
For instance , this evening , we had a , received an SMS .
A friend said , I work on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">12th</ENAMEX> floor of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the China World Trade Center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Guomao Bridge</ENAMEX> , ah .
We were discussing that we could go home in fewer cars since everyone was on the same route .
Later on , we suggested to him and said , you , ah , might as well take the subway , because you can directly reach the subway once you get down from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the China World Trade Center</ENAMEX> .
Right .
Hey , he said this was quite a good idea .
Actually , I think everyone was quite cooperative and also quite supportive in this aspect .
Yes , many viewers , viewers not in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> may not be quite familiar , ah , with this road section we just mentioned , where , ah , the accident occurred .
Ah , we can take a look later through an animation .
This road represents a main road on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">East Third Ring Road</ENAMEX> , with problems on both the main and side roads .
Furthermore , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chaoyang Road</ENAMEX> is an intersection .
Uh-huh .
Whether it is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chaoyang Road</ENAMEX> in the east - west direction or the main and side roads of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">East Third Ring Road</ENAMEX> in the south - north direction , as we can see from this diagram , it can be said that the area at the main and side roads of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">East Third Ring Road</ENAMEX> normally has quite heavy traffic , especially during commuting times .
Well , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chaoyang Road</ENAMEX> is a very important artery in the east - west direction .
Yes .
When people living in the west want to cross over from the city , they have to go via this road .
Hence , if a traffic accident occurs at this place , we can indeed imagine , ha , how widespread , ah , the extent of the impact will be , such as the number of cars caught in traffic jams .
Yes , actually I think everyone can see that from the buses that cross <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jingguang Bridge</ENAMEX> .
Yes .
As buses that cross <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Third Ring Road</ENAMEX> are currently , right now affected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jingguang Bridge</ENAMEX> accident , ah , the latest results this morning show that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</ENAMEX> bus routes throughout the neighborhood have had to be rerouted .
Uh-huh .
Well , I think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> place is able to accommodate <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</ENAMEX> commuter routes .
If the accident did not happen , perhaps everyone would not know that this place could normally have so many --
It is really like this , just look at the bus signs .
Right .
Have not seen so many buses .
Right .
Its effect on people has been extremely extensive .
Yes .
Uh-huh .
Well , what measures did the traffic control department eventually take to direct traffic ?
Our correspondent specially interviewed Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meng Xianlong</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meng Xianlong</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Command Center of the Beijing Municipal Traffic Administration</ENAMEX> .
Let 's hear what Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meng</ENAMEX> said .
Um , our traffic control department immediately activated the traffic emergency response plan .
In the roads close to where the problem emerged , we <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> set up traffic diversion points for traffic control at the southern and northern ends .
In this way , all vehicles going along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">East Third Ring Road</ENAMEX> had to make a detour to go on roads on the east and west sides .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">East Third Ring Road</ENAMEX> is a traffic artery in the east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> that links the north and the south .
In order to ensure smooth traffic in the eastern district , we formulated a set of traffic diversion control plans .
We set up traffic diversion points at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</ENAMEX> locations along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">East Second Ring Road</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">East Fourth Ring Road</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">West Dawang Road</ENAMEX> , ah , and related roads to the east and west , and deployed more than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">210</ENAMEX> additional police officers to divert and direct traffic .
It can be said that measures were very promptly taken .
Ah , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> workday after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">New Year</ENAMEX> holiday .
Well , what exactly was the situation this morning ?
We specially sent a reporter to the scene <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">this morning</ENAMEX> to shoot some footage .
Let 's take a look at the situation this morning through this footage .
Well , from this footage , we can see that , ha , at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">East Third Ring Road</ENAMEX> , ah , near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Guanghua Bridge</ENAMEX> , the roads here that lead to the vicinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jingguang Bridge</ENAMEX> have come under control and , well , various kinds of signs have also been placed at very conspicuous locations .
Although the outdoor temperature in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> has fallen to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">minus 3 degrees</ENAMEX> , the traffic police deployed additional manpower on the roads to direct traffic , ah , and guide drivers in making detours .
Well , since direction of traffic was carried out on the periphery , the number of vehicles at the section of the accident was significantly less than usual , with road traffic very orderly .
Ah , it can be said , ah , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Yang</ENAMEX> , citizens , regardless of whether they took the bus or drove , their mentality , in terms of being understanding or calm , ah , was a very important factor in having orderly traffic at the scene .
Uh-huh .
Right , right .
You , through your listeners , what kind of feedback did you find out from them ?
Actually , this morning , some listeners , ah , also happened to tell us about it via mobile phone SMS .
Many of their friends -- Since we know that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jingguang Bridge</ENAMEX> is located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CBD</ENAMEX> district , well there are many office buildings , ah , a lot of them , as well as quite a lot of friends who get up <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</ENAMEX> to go to work .
Therefore , they sent SMS saying , hey , it is unusual , ah , for me to be walking to the bus station <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> or going to take the bus .
Well , it is unusual for me to enjoy a very pleasant morning .
We then reminded everyone to wear extra clothing .
This shows that when people encounter such kind of emergency , they have started to be able to face it with a very calm and pleasant state of mind .
I think that this mentality in facing emergencies , in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> respect shows a great change of mentality that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> citizens now have after enduring several tests in the past , and a kind of calmness and maturity after having experienced frustrations .
On the other hand , I think it can also fully show the level of people 's satisfaction with emergency mechanisms of the operational departments of the government in handling this incident .
That is , they think that the government has tried its best .
Well , in this respect , we citizens should also contribute our efforts .
Uh-huh .
As such , in this regard , I think people 's mentality can become very calm .
Uh-huh .
Well , Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou</ENAMEX> , from this perspective , is this <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> highly positive effect achieved after information was disclosed ?
Yes .
In terms of citizens ' mentality .
Yes , in fact it can be seen from this particular case .
That is , when the government was handling this kind of public emergency , well , it went from a traditionally unilateral administrative management method , well , a method in which information was quite delayed , to disclosure and transparency of information , and very fast as well .
We know that in the past , disclosure of information had to be reported to higher authorities , level by level , until the highest authorities had given approval , before information could be disclosed .
Time was lost .
Well , yes , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Council</ENAMEX> has , er , put forth a regulation concerning the establishment of public early warning mechanisms .
That is , related information that can be publicized will be publicized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> , in order to guide people in what to do .
In this way , related interaction between the government and the people can be formed .
That is , in modern public management , ah , this is a very good case , that is , of shifting from a kind of unilateral administrative management to public management and to positive interaction between the government and the people .
I think in fact , we can sum up many beneficial experiences from this case and actually extend them to other areas .
Yes , this is when we look at this case from the perspective of traffic .
Traffic was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> thing to be impacted when this accident , cave - in accident occurred .
However , this accident actually involved many underground pipes , such as sewage pipes , ah , or water , ah , and gas , ah , pipes , that affect the lives of citizens in many other aspects .
Yes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Yang</ENAMEX> , do you know how many pipes there are underground ?
Right now , there should be seven main types of pipes buried underground .
They include those like you just mentioned , as well as pipes like those for heating and communication , among others .
Truly , these pipes are closely linked to the lives of citizens .
Closely linked .
Yes , therefore besides our attention to the traffic issue just now , people are also very concerned , ah , with the situation after the accident , with other aspects affecting citizens ' lives .
Let 's take a look again at this footage of the situation of dealing with the current scene .
Ah , according to our understanding of the situation , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Beijing Municipal Construction Commission</ENAMEX> , ah , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Communication Commission</ENAMEX> , ah , and telecommunication , traffic , and other departments have assigned personnel to participate in emergency repair work .
Relevant departments said that they will adopt a full range of measures to minimize the level of impact on people 's daily lives and work , in order to ensure stable order in society during the recovery period .
Well , looking at the government 's response to this cave - in accident , ah , we should say it was very prompt with traffic management and emergency repair , ah , because it involved various aspects of life .
Well , ah , Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou</ENAMEX> , as this incident involved many departments after it took place , how do you think the various departments should coordinate between themselves ?
Yes .
This is also --
It is not the case that this problem will be totally solved when one department shows up .
Yes , I think as we build this kind , er , of public , this kind of emergency mechanism for public incidents , ah , has been the most , most difficult to resolve , an actual problem that has been the most difficult to resolve among administrative management reforms in various countries .
How many groups of people will be sent ?
Many groups .
Yes , this is because social management requires division of labor in society .
It is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments , and in addition , a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified .
Uh-huh .
How can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ?
Well , sometimes under normal circumstances , sometimes , we often feel that it is very difficult for departments to cooperate with one another .
For instance , there are too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments , and very often in the end , they are unable to coordinate .
However , this time , through the execution of emergency contingency plans by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing Municipality</ENAMEX> this time , ah , it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing Municipality</ENAMEX> , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role .
Hence , I think this was also a kind of , er , trial of interdepartmental cooperation mechanisms .
Uh-huh .
It was a very successful , er , response .
I think many good things can be summed up from this .
Yes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Yang</ENAMEX> , based on your understanding , ah , as pipes that directly affect many common people 's lives were damaged after the accident , based on your understanding of the situation , how was remedial work carried out ?
For instance , it is very cold during winter in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> , and the temperature <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</ENAMEX> dropped to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the lowest points recently .
Er , heating pipes were indeed damaged .
Well , at the time , it affected residents living in an area of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 70,000 square meters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
Well , in this , in this regard , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chaoyang</ENAMEX> district government did a very good job .
After it received from the municipal government , er , received this order from the municipal government , it immediately sent electric heat , electric heaters to residents in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200</ENAMEX> households within this area .
It should be said that many residents spent quite a warm night at home <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
Well , furthermore , in the emergency repair process , ah , it should be said that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly .
Hence , over here , I think the municipal government , ah , including sub-district offices , made a lot of effort to take good care of resident households .
I think it was done in a very humanitarian manner .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou</ENAMEX> , actually for such a large scale city as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> that has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 14 million</ENAMEX> people , ah , for such a big city , a suddenly occurring public emergency like this should be said to be relatively common .
Yes .
I think it should be unexpected yet at the same time within expectations .
For instance , we see that other , er , domestic and overseas cities have experienced similar incidents .
Perhaps many overseas cities have had such kind of thing before .
This is because a city is a gathering place for modern life .
It is a highly civilized place , as well as , however , in fact a gathering point for various conflicts , social , economic , security , various aspects of conflict .
Hence it is not at all surprising for such an accident to occur .
The critical thing is --
But the critical thing is how emergency plans are activated after the occurrence of such accidents , and for a city , this is a test of its response capabilities .
Yes .
Yes .
Yes , I think through a few incidents that happened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing Municipality</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , such as SARS , the snowfall <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</ENAMEX> , the heavy rains two years ago , and the road cave - in at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">East Third Ring Road</ENAMEX> this time , I think it can be seen that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing Municipality 's</ENAMEX> response capabilities continued to improve each time .
Right .
It can be said that this time , what was done has received favorable comments from everyone .
Um , well , I think , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Yang</ENAMEX> , perhaps you have stronger feelings on this aspect , ah .
Yes .
Because you often have this kind of direct SMS exchange with listeners .
It is because , we , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Beijing Traffic Radio Station</ENAMEX> , has become a part of emergency planning in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
Well , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Beijing Traffic Radio Station</ENAMEX> is to be activated as a media for emergency plans that are grade <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> and above .
Well , for instance , as people still vividly remember , at the time of that snowfall just mentioned by Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou</ENAMEX> that people still vividly remember , there were no plans .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing Municipality</ENAMEX> still had no emergency plan .
Well , at that time , it happened that I was hosting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Unblocked All the Way</ENAMEX> program in the studio <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">that evening</ENAMEX> .
Well , at that time , traffic was not at all unblocked .
Ah , at that time there was none of this kind of interaction .
It was not clear , it was very congested .
You sat inside the studio and only knew about the heavy snowfall .
You could find out other news only by telephone .
The various methods and channels were extremely unclear .
Well , later , when we experienced that rainfall in Beijing , that rainfall <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> , as well as some days of sand storms , all channels and early warning mechanisms were activated in quite an orderly manner .
From our perspective as media , I think it was precisely by going through those breaking - in , trials that we could be so calm in handling such an emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , ah , and give everyone the most effective announcements and notifications , and instructions .
Yes , therefore , as a local media in this city , it should become a proactive participant when there is a public emergency in the city .
Yes .
It should play its individual role in the process of resolving emergencies .
Ah , apart from this , Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou</ENAMEX> , what do you think are the areas for improvement for a city , especially a booming city , when handling this kind of public emergency ?
Right , I think this gave us many revelations , ah .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , I think one that should be especially important is early warnings and forecasts .
This is because currently , there are , ah , frequently various kinds of risks lurking in cities , ah .
Early warnings and forecasts .
Yes , this kind of early warning and forecast mechanism .
Uh-huh .
It is not only for this , this , ah , this , this kind of sudden road cave - in , it also includes , for instance , security incidents , ah , in our society , as well as natural disasters , ah , and including public health incidents .
Uh-huh .
That is , this kind of scientific early warning and forecast mechanism must be set up .
Uh-huh .
In this way , you can manage and resolve an abnormal situation by turning it into a normal situation , without evolving into a sudden public emergency .
Uh-huh .
Another thing I want to say is that besides , ah , emergency response and speedy integration mechanisms , I think some corresponding improvements should be made to the release of information , incident investigation , ah , and the relevant post-incident responsibility , responsibility system .
In fact , there are , that is , we should say that the government already has quite a number of relevant systems in this respect .
For instance , we have an administrative investigation system for incidents of major responsibility .
We have regulations on investigation procedures for very major incidents , as well as others such as emergency response methods for handling public health incidents and public health emergencies , among others .
That is to say , we have many corresponding systems .
However , the question is how city management , er , handles these various kinds of perhaps unpredictable cases .
Since we are entering new circumstances of human living , circumstances that contain high risk and have an increasingly developed urbanized life , well , I think corresponding improvements should be made to the formation of a series of systems that includes scientific planning , early warning and forecast , emergency response , accident investigation , and accountability .
Um , well , based on your understanding of the situation , and from an international perspective , what are some better ways of urban management that are worthwhile for us to learn ?
I think , in comparison to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , we should say that urbanization in foreign countries developed earlier and is more widespread .
Their level of development is more advanced than ours .
Although the scale of our urbanization is currently expanding at a rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</ENAMEX> per year , I think , with our economic development being relatively backward , we actually still have many aspects of urban management to learn from foreign countries .
For instance , many of the pipes involved in this incident were basic infrastructure , public utilities industries .
With a background of liberalization , marketization , and privatization , how can the government strengthen supervision of public utilities industries ?
How can a safe , assured system be established ?
Well , we need to learn and manage this .
Uh-huh .
For instance , regarding information disclosure , well , our speed of information disclosure this time was very fast .
However , we still have a lot of work to do in making the information disclosure , er , system more standardized and , that is , to really implement a system of levels of responsibility .
Well , we also need to explore how cooperation mechanisms between departments execute cooperation under normal situations and , well , how departments should cooperate with one another under these kinds of public emergency circumstances .
Well , for some of our emergency contingency plans , well , ah , how will these emergency contingency plans withstand these tests ?
We know that currently , many ministries and commissions , as well as people 's governments at the provincial level , along with those at municipal and district levels , have set up emergency contingency plans for public emergencies , but many of them have not been put to the test .
Well , how will they go undergo testing ?
These also include some of our command and policy - making systems .
So , with the growth of urbanization and with more and more of such complicated issues , ah , I think there will be increasingly high requirements on the systems .
That is , development of future systems is one of the top current priorities .
How can we institutionalize our response mechanisms and make them into a system so as to ensure the lifestyle of people who live in such a large - scale city ?
%pw <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The State Council</ENAMEX> has proposed a public emergency contingency plan , called <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> Plan , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> Systems .
Uh-huh .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> plan " refers to the contingency plan , and " <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> systems " refers to systems of organizations , mechanisms , and laws .
So , I think we still have a lot of work to do in these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> areas of organizations , mechanisms , and laws .
Yes .
Well , finally , let 's turn our attention to handling of the situation , ah , during the latter stages of the cave - in accident in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
Traffic , ah , can be said to have been directed , and is basically under control now .
Well , following this , repairs have to be made on this road section where the accident occurred , including for many pipes .
Well , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Yang</ENAMEX> , based on your understanding , how long will it take ?
I think that the time really depends on how the overall repair goes .
This is because exploration , assessment , and repair are carried out in succession .
Therefore , regarding this work progress , to repair this road section in the shortest time , um , this will depend on the work progress .
Uh-huh .
This is because repair is probably not a matter of repairing the road surface alone .
There is also an issue with many of the pipes below .
Yes , the pipes below .
Right , as it is winter , we know that carrying out construction during winter , especially that which requires pouring concrete and then --
Moreover , it is especially difficult for concrete to set during winter .
Yes , preparation mix for making it dry faster has already been added , has already been added .
But in the end , it requires time .
Hence , it depends very much on factors like temperature .
Just now , you mentioned that there are many pipes , ah , for instance , there is a key heating pipeline .
The first thing is to ensure that it is connected in time .
Yes .
In addition , waste discharge is also very important .
Waste discharged has currently blocked this up .
Um , and , for instance , optical fibers , ah .
Er , right now , if the optical fibers break , people in many households will not be able to watch television .
Yes .
At present , we should not have a problem with watching television .
They are not broken .
It is just that , as the other pipes have to be repaired , the optical fibers have to be rearranged , to be hung up it seems .
After that , or it seems that a few steel pipes have been added below to make it %pw safer to walk across this section .
Furthermore , let 's take water pipes as an example .
Because they were exposed , The water pipes were not --
after that , yes , these were not damaged .
they were not damaged and this is quite normal .
Um , there is no problem with water supply .
Okay , well , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> both of you have come to the studio and given us a lot of specific details concerning this road cave - in accident in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing Municipality</ENAMEX> .
At the same time , you have also analyzed , from a system perspective , how the government has reinforced emergency contingency plans to handle such public emergency cases .
Okay , thank you very much , Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Yang</ENAMEX> , for coming to the studio to participate in our program .
Thank you , both of you .
Okay , dear viewers , that is all for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Focus Today</ENAMEX> .
Thank you for watching .
See you at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the same time tomorrow</ENAMEX> .
Hello .
Let 's turn our attention to the weather .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , we can use two words to summarize the weather in our country .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , there will be a temperature drop over a large area , and next , there will be rainfall and snowfall in an extensive area as well .
We see that except for some areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South China</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Southwest China</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northeast China</ENAMEX> , many other places will be experiencing temperature drops .
In addition , there will be snowfall in the area from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northwest China</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huang</ENAMEX> - Huai area through southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">North China</ENAMEX> .
The east of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Southwest China</ENAMEX> , as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jiang</ENAMEX> - Huai area and the area south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Yangtze River</ENAMEX> , will experience continuous rainfall .
However , southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">North China</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huang</ENAMEX> - Huai area will bid farewell to the snow <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> , ah .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Tomorrow during the day</ENAMEX> , snowfall in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jiang</ENAMEX> - Huai area will stop , and there will also be less snow in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northwest China</ENAMEX> .
In addition , there will be rain throughout almost the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South China</ENAMEX> .
It can be said that there will be less snow in the north and heavier rain in the south <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> .
Furthermore , temperatures <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> in many places south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Huai River</ENAMEX> will fall by between <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ten degrees</ENAMEX> .
