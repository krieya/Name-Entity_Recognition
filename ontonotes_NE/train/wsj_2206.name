Ambassador <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Nitze</ENAMEX> 's statement -LRB- Notable -AMP- Quotable , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 20</ENAMEX> -RRB- , `` If you have a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</ENAMEX> people working for you , every bad thing that has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> chance in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</ENAMEX> of going wrong will go wrong at least once a year , '' is a pretty negative way of looking at things .
Is n't it just as fair to say that if you have a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</ENAMEX> people working for you , every good thing that has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> chance in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</ENAMEX> of going right will go right at least once a year ?
Do n't be such a pessimist , Mr. Ambassador .
