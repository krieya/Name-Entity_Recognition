<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bankers Trust New York Corp.</ENAMEX> won permission from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> to move the company 's private placement department to its fledgling securities subsidiary .
The seemingly mundane action , which was opposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Securities Industry Association</ENAMEX> , a trade group , has important implications for banks ' recent entry into the underwriting of corporate securities .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> 's action increases the volume of publicly registered securities that banks ' securities affiliates will be able to underwrite .
Several other banks have similar applications pending .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> has given a handful of banks ' securities affiliates permission to underwrite and deal in a variety of corporate , asset - backed and municipal securities that had previously been the sole domain of securities firms .
Securities firms have challenged those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> approvals , saying they violate federal laws separating the banking and securities businesses .
However , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> limited the revenue that banks could earn from these new underwriting activities to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">no more than 10 %</ENAMEX> of the revenue earned from other securities activities long open to banks , such as dealing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> Treasurys .
For some banks that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> ceiling created problems .
But , by allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BT Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> to handle private placements , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> boosted the volume of new types of underwriting that the unit can do .
Private placements involve debt and equity securities , typically in denominations of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</ENAMEX> , that are sold to institutional investors and are n't registered with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bankers Trust</ENAMEX> said it placed <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</ENAMEX> of corporate debt and equities privately .
