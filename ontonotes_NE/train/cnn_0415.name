A net worth of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 million</ENAMEX> .
Anyone who knows me knows my obsession with tween stars .
They 're kids <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eight</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">14</ENAMEX> , and for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</ENAMEX> , their heroes are barely occupy puberty .
The reason for my obsession is simple , deep seething jealousy .
It is n't enough for these tween stars to be on the TV or movie .
They want to own every form of media and want to own it now .
Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">the Corey Feldman</ENAMEX> of the ' <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">80s</ENAMEX> , today 's tweens are n't content with succeeding in just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of medium .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Kate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashley Olsen</ENAMEX> started it all .
Now they have a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion dollar</ENAMEX> empire built on videos , clothing perfume and more .
And then there 's the tween <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hilary Duff</ENAMEX> .
Fans know her as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lizzie Maguire</ENAMEX> .
Movies , books , albums .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> corporate giants head the way .
Typical , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nickelodeon</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Disney</ENAMEX> starts them off .
Then when they 're ready to breed they go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WB</ENAMEX> .
Why such a focus on these tween stars ?
It has little to do with their artistic vision .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> star told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> their favorite author is whoever wrote the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> .
These kids are at that magical age when new <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">multibillion</ENAMEX> declare spending power is put in service of intense peer pressure leading to brand loyalties that can last a lifetime .
The flip side between stars , though , is once the fans grow up their star power may dim .
Do n't believe it just ask one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coreys</ENAMEX> .
These tweens are everywhere .
They 're right on the cover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> .
Tweens are all over it .
That 's the issue right there .
So we have with us <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> Fashion Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Olsen</ENAMEX> .
I was shocked when I saw them cover the tweens .
Why are they so important ?
They 're important because we report on what 's happening .
We report on the culture of what 's now , what makes money , what the buzz is , what 's next .
And they 're making a lot of money .
A much more than a lot of money .
Unlike stars of the past , they really are not content to be singers or dancers , they are like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Omnimedia</ENAMEX> , mini <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Stewart</ENAMEX> .
They 're more than that , actually , because they have a television show to back themselves up , then the movie , then the clothing line .
They have much more and reach a much broader audience as well .
I saw one interviewed , and they said , Yeah , when I left <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Cosby Show</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">age four</ENAMEX> , I cut an album at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">age five</ENAMEX> .
What happened happened to being kids ?
That was the great thing about the photo shoot .
They 're still young , ambitious , excited , they play dressup and have pillow fights .
Who 's the ultimate tween ?
I would have I to say you have to talk about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hilary Duff</ENAMEX> , and you have to talk about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olsen</ENAMEX> twins .
Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olsen</ENAMEX> twins started it all .
They created it , maybe .
They more than started it .
And they started prenatal .
But they turned it into an empire , what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirley Temple</ENAMEX> could have done .
Had she only known .
I think their company is called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dual Star</ENAMEX> .
Like a gross of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a billion dollars</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
They work hard .
They 're not just sitting there hiring people to do their business .
They do their own business , and they 're well - rounded and polite people .
Are they nice ?
They 're so nice and cool .
How about that ?
They 're actually very , very cool .
I 'm not sure of that .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hilary Duff</ENAMEX> is a star , and I guarantee you , they will grace their own cover .
Do they all have staying power ?
One ca n't predict that all have it , but some have it .
It depends on who 's managing it , what career choices they make , what their parents help them to do .
It would be interesting to see the audience that sort of adores them now , whether --
