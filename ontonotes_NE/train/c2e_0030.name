Title : ZT Han Han : Car Knowledge and Manifestation of Life -LRB- Regarding the car accident involving that beautiful/talented <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> girl -RRB-

<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A few days ago</ENAMEX> , another <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> star passed away .
I had never heard of her .
I hear she was a talented beauty .
What a great pity !
The accident was a car crash .
Much of the entertainment news denounced that +her car 's front airbag failed to release , which caused the death .
In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the MINI COOPER</ENAMEX> she was riding in is not what the reports said .
It is the car with the highest safety index .
It is sold for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">190,000 HK dollars</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Polo</ENAMEX> also sells for more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">140,000 HK dollars</ENAMEX> .
It 's just a cute little car , preferred by girls .
But safety is surely not too big of a problem .
The collision happened on the side and rear .
So , the side airbag and air curtain were fully opened .
They opened at the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> collision with the protective fence .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> collision was with the protective fence only , and the impact on the people was very small .
In addition , there was the protection of the air curtain .
So , there would surely not be a big problem .
The real fatal collision was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> one from the tailgating truck .
At that time , all the airbags were already deflated .
There was no protective effect .
Furthermore , the force of this one was extremely large .
If the car had been stopped at an angle , then the head of the person sitting on one side would surely have hit the glass or the B column .
Meanwhile , there would not have been too much of a problem for someone on the other side .
This is common knowledge .
Then it came down to who had the bad luck of sitting on the side of the car that was angled out .
It was perfectly correct for the front airbag not to open , because the front of the car was not damaged at all .
None of the sensors received any signal of a collision .
Just imagine , this was a rear collision .
The people went backward abruptly .
Their bodies could have been supported by the seats , but the impact on their necks and heads was tremendous .
When they went abruptly backward , any additional misfortune of the front airbag opening for no reason would have eliminated any chance of survival .
So , of all the cars in the world , even a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rolls - Royce</ENAMEX> , the front airbag will not open during a rear collision .
If the front airbag opened after being tailgated , that would be a quality problem , and would be extremely dangerous .
The safety airbag 's eruption could knock someone to death .
So , infants are strictly forbidden from sitting in the front seat .
That was how the whole accident took place .
The result of the accident investigation division will not be different from this .
For this kind of accident , conclusions can be drawn from a single glance at the car wreckage .
The car and the car manufacturer have no fault .
All of the car 's passive safety protections had already fully carried out their functions .
So , it is extremely ridiculous and unscientific to blame and suspect the car and the car manufacturer for such an accident .
In particular , speculation about why the front airbags did not open was very amateurish .
Only by not opening would it have been correct .
If they had opened , her assistant might still be lying in the hospital .
If an accident occurs on the freeway , please get out of the car and leave immediately if you can move .
Many freeway accidents occur simply because people stay inside the car and sort out their thoughts , following which there is a fatal crash from a car following behind .
About death , I have always believed that they do not leave the world .
They only leave the human world .
They are surely sharing the same world with us , with a different manifestation of life .

It is in change that we find purpose .
