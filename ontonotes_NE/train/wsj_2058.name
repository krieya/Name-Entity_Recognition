<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX> said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> space probe , which is to be launched <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Redmond</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> spokesman , said the agency discovered the virus on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> on the collection of computer networks collectively called Internet and expected <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> university centers to be infected by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
Although the network is n't connected to the computer systems that operate either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> or the shuttle , part of the network will carry analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> data once the craft gets spaceborn .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redmond</ENAMEX> said the intruder had n't yet done any harm but the agency feared `` garbage data could be substituted for real data . ''
He estimated it could take <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</ENAMEX> for a computer security manager to expunge the virus from a computer system .
The intruder , among the broadest yet to hit a research network , appeared to affect only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> hardware that uses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VAX / VMS</ENAMEX> operating system .
It is unrelated to the much - publicized virus that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arpanet</ENAMEX> , a much larger network used by researchers at universities , laboratories and government agencies around the world .
In the lingo of computer security , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> intruder is technically a computer worm , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redmond</ENAMEX> said .
A worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> worm apparently was hatched on a computer in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> hooked up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Space Physics Analysis Network</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redmond</ENAMEX> said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> worm had n't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their systems to reject worms .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redmond</ENAMEX> said the worm hit universities that had n't elected to make the changes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Alexander</ENAMEX> , a senior editor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Computerworld</ENAMEX> , a trade publication , said he was told that the worm gets into a computer center by looking for obvious passwords -- such as ones that are the same as the user 's name .
If it finds <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> and gets into the system , it will display a screen when a user logs on that says , `` Worms Against Nuclear Killers ... .
You talk of times of peace for all , and then prepare for war . ''
In addition , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> said , the worm sends strange messages to other machines at the center -- such as , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Orwell</ENAMEX> was an optimist , '' or `` Do n't feed the bats tonight . ''
The worm also looks for elementary passwords that confer more privileges on the user .
The passwords are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running .
If it finds <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of those passwords , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> said , the worm will do such things as change users ' passwords to a series of random numbers , preventing them from signing on to the network .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> estimated that , on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four</ENAMEX> computer centers were affected .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , the number grew to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> the number is expected to grow to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> said it will take <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week</ENAMEX> before it knows exactly how many centers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</ENAMEX> connected to Internet were affected and the extent of the damage , if any .
Anti-nuclear activists have protested the launch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> space probe to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> because it uses plutonium to generate the electricity needed to run the craft .
Activists fear that if the shuttle carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> into orbit should explode , or if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> itself crashes into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> times it flies close to the planet , fatal levels of plutonium would be released into the atmosphere .
So far <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> has been delayed twice , once because of a computer malfunction connected with a space - shuttle engine , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> because of the weather .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> worm had nothing to do with either delay .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Computerworld</ENAMEX> said hackers have gone after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SPAN</ENAMEX> before .
He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chaos Computer Club</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> , once managed to invade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SPAN</ENAMEX> and do such things as change the value of pi , messing up some calculations .
