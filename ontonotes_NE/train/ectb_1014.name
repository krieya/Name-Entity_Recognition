Will the Election Weaken Political Parties ?

In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's " quiet revolution " of democratization , the people have participated enthusiastically , but not irrationally .
Now that there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> strong parties , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> , the slogan of " peaceful rotation of political parties in power " has become <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the most widely used appeals for the opposition .
It happens to be the turn of the mil - lennium , and this has inspired many people to think of change .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of March</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> will select the president who will lead the island into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the new century</ENAMEX> .
But the election , besides affecting the future direction of the country , has another rarely mentioned dimension : Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> major candidates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien Chan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Shui - bian</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> are running roughly equal , this suggests that after the election there may be a restructuring of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's political party system .
The people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> are selecting not only their future leaders , but are choosing a new direction for party politics and democratic development .
What is it about the political environment that means that the election for the president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> , which was not conceived as a presidential system , will affect the future development of the country ?
How will party politics change after the election ?
Is there likely to be a constitutional crisis ?
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2000</ENAMEX> , there are many challenges :
The pressure is on to achieve industrial upgrading and internationalization .
Also , there needs to be clear progress in the critical area of cross-strait relations .
Although entry into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the World Trade Organization</ENAMEX> will create a new situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Taiwan Strait</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides remain in an obscure relationship that is neither war nor peace .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> must come up with a comprehensive policy that considers economic , diplomatic , and military factors .
Internally , there are a number of worrying problems - " black gold politics " -LRB- the confluence of criminal gangs , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians -RRB- , rising crime , and only erratic environmental consciousness .
It is urgent to achieve consensus on these problems in order to find solutions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> - way battle
The desire for change is reflected in the upcoming presidential election .
This is the beginning of the post-strongman era .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Pomfret</ENAMEX> , bureau chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Washington Post</ENAMEX> , points out that , after a long era of rule by virtually unchallenged leaders , the electorate is looking for more choice .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</ENAMEX> race , with so many tickets contending , reflects this aspiration .
At the top , this election is a contest among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> - generation political elites .
Underneath , it is a struggle among the various forces that currently exist in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's society .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> nominee , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien Chan</ENAMEX> , is seen as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng - hui 's</ENAMEX> annointed successor .
He represents the continuation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kuomintang</ENAMEX> tradition .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Shui - bian</ENAMEX> , the nominee of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Democratic Progressive Party</ENAMEX> , is the greatest hope for the opposition party as it seeks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> - ever transfer of power in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
Independent candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , represents forces which have split away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kuomintang</ENAMEX> .
He is seen as leading a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> wave of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON" S_OFF="5">" anti-Lee Teng - hui "</ENAMEX> sentiment , similar to that which led to the creation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New Party</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> 's candidacy has opened up new fault lines in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's party politics , and has attracted the support of many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NP</ENAMEX> legislators and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG" S_OFF="4">non-KMT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG" S_OFF="4">non-DPP</ENAMEX> forces .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The New Party</ENAMEX> itself , which is on the edge of collapse , has nominated the renowned author <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Ao</ENAMEX> as its candidate , though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX> is not a party member .
In addition to these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> , former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu Hsin - liang</ENAMEX> , having failed to win the nomination of his party , withdrew from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> and is running as an independent .
Since the campaign began in earnest , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> have been getting roughly similar numbers in public opinion polls , with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a quarter</ENAMEX> of the electorate undecided .
With the election so close at hand , and the situation so uncertain , naturally the media and society have been focused on analyzing the election battle itself .
Very few people have transcended this to ask what impact the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> - way power struggle will have on the future political situation .
Public opinion trial balloon
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROC</ENAMEX> constitution was not originally designed as a presidential system .
The constitution divided power among <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> branches of government , with the premier as head of the executive branch , and the president separate from , but theoretically not controlling , these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> .
In the past , presidents <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Kai - shek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Ching - kuo</ENAMEX> were the de facto unchallenged rulers of the nation , but that was because of their roles as chairmen of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kuomintang</ENAMEX> , which , under the old <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - party system , outlawed any opposition .
They were president because they were powerful , not powerful because they were president .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> times have changed , and so has the constitution .
Most importantly , the constitutional power of the president has been greatly increased .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin Wen - cheng</ENAMEX> , an associate professor in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Graduate Institute of Mainland China Studies</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Sun Yat - sen University</ENAMEX> , notes that the president had always enjoyed a number of special powers : appointing and dismissing of officials , dissolving of the parliament , issuing of emergency decrees in times of national emergency , and determining national - security - related policies through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Security Council</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Security Bureau</ENAMEX> .
But recent constitutional revisions also give the president the power to appoint the premier without requiring approval from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Legislative Yuan</ENAMEX> .
This means that the president is now the guiding figure behind all executive branch policy .
Of course President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng - hui</ENAMEX> 's exercise of such powers has not proved politically destabilizing because he has been concurrently chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> , which enjoys a majority in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Legislative Yuan</ENAMEX> .
However , if the opposition wins the presidency , it is uncertain whether the president and legislature will be able to work together harmoniously .
If there are conflicts , this could spark a constitutional crisis .
Another development that needs watching is that direct election of the president has weakened political parties .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Lu</ENAMEX> , professor of political science at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Taiwan University</ENAMEX> , states that voters no longer base their choice primarily on political party .
This is what has enabled independent candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> to remain a powerful force even after leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> .
Whether he wins or not , his candidacy signals a drastic change in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's party politics .
Candidate as hero
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu</ENAMEX> continues : " Direct election of the president has ' put the candidate on a pedestal , ' turning the attention of the voters to the individual .
But in fact the most significant thing about this election is not which ' hero ' will lead the country .
Rather , voters should pay even more attention to how each of the candidates could affect future party politics and the direction of constitutional development . "
In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's main parties - the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> major parties , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New Party</ENAMEX> as a noteworthy but limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> force - all understand the implications of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong 's</ENAMEX> powerful candidacy very clearly .
They know that this election is not only a struggle for political office , but even more is a critical moment that may decide whether their respective parties develop , split up , or disappear .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> party chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng - hui</ENAMEX> has repeatedly called on voters to cherish the system of party politics that has been constructed in the process of democratization ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> wants confirmation that people still see it as a coherent , positive political institution .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> sees this election as its chance to displace the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> and set a precedent for the peaceful rotation of political parties in power , thereby consolidating its position as the main alternative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> , on the other hand , hoping to take advantage of the desire for change , emphasizes that if he is elected as a non-party candidate he will promote reforms which will alter the roles of the major parties .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The New Party</ENAMEX> is in the most embarrassing position , since its candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">-LRB- Li Ao -RRB-</ENAMEX> is not even a party member , and has been unable to keep most of its members from shifting their support to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> instead ; this election could therefore hasten the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NP</ENAMEX> .
Peaceful transfer of power
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Shui - bian</ENAMEX> is elected , this would be <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> case of a peaceful transfer of power from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> party to another .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> legislator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Chun - hung</ENAMEX> says that the process of democratization in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng - hui 's</ENAMEX> administration has been smooth and tranquil , but beneath the surface there lurks a major threat to democracy : the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> 's " black gold politics . "
Explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> : The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> has never had the chance to be the ruling party , and therefore has never been in a position to fulfill its function of restraining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> .
The result of this long - term trend is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> is " overnourished " by feeding on the resources of the state and society while the opposition parties are " undernourished . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> says if there were a transfer of power , the opposition would be able to understand more clearly the actual difficulties of governing and to see more clearly the dark corners that need to be cleaned out .
Meanwhile , the ruling party , with its rich experience in governing , would be very qualified to play the role of overseeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> , and a defeat for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> could also promote its internal reassessment and reform .
Were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Shui - bian</ENAMEX> to win , though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> would take control of the executive branch , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's current <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - major - plus - <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - minor party structure would probably not change very much .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Wen - cheng</ENAMEX> says that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> victory would have its greatest impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New Party</ENAMEX> - and that the effect would be positive .
After an impressive start , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NP</ENAMEX> has faded steadily over the past few elections , and suffered an especially sharp blow in the election for mayor of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NP</ENAMEX> votes drifted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ma Ying - jeou</ENAMEX> , a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> -LRB- albeit not <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng - hui 's</ENAMEX> personal favorites -RRB- .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NP</ENAMEX> candidate received only an anemic percentage of the ballots , bringing the party to the edge of collapse .
But if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Shui - bian</ENAMEX> becomes president , because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> is seen as the party of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> independence - the direct antithesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New Party</ENAMEX> - this could inspire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NP</ENAMEX> members to pull together , and at the same time give the party the status and ability to absorb the forces that are backing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> .
This would contribute to the building of a true <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> - party system .
An opposition - controlled legislature
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Shui - bian</ENAMEX> is elected , his biggest challenge will come from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Legislative Yuan</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> problem will be naming a premier .
Although the constitution stipulates that the president does not need the approval of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Legislative Yuan</ENAMEX> to name a premier , given the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> has a majority there , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> faces the problem of finding a premier who will be able to work with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> legislators .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> camp is well aware of this problem .
Therefore they have let it be known that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> would like to ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Yuan - tse</ENAMEX> , the universally respected <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize</ENAMEX> winner who is currently president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Academia Sinica</ENAMEX> , to be his premier .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> , who knows that within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> there is little high - level governing experience , has repeatedly raised the idea of a " coalition government . "
However , it should be noted , there are after all great ideological differences between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> and the other parties .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> legislator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Hsien - jen</ENAMEX> points out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> retains advocacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> independence in its party platform , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> vice-presidential candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annette Lu</ENAMEX> is well known for her support of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> independence .
It is therefore hard to guarantee that the executive branch will not come into conflict with the legislature .
In such a conflict , the premier would be caught in the crossfire .
The legislature could pass a vote of no confidence and completely boycott the premier , or the premier could dissolve the parliament and appeal to a public referendum .
Either case would spark a constitutional crisis .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Lu</ENAMEX> agrees that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> victory could lead to inter-branch conflict .
But he does not see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> independence as the main flashpoint .
The critical issues will instead be those related to " black gold politics , " such as stock trading taxes , which directly affect the interests of certain legislators .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu</ENAMEX> explains : " Currently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Legislative Yuan</ENAMEX> is filled with representatives of capital .
When it comes to laws that directly affect their personal privileges and interests , even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> is powerless to control them .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Shui - bian</ENAMEX> has repeatedly emphasized that he intends to wipe out black gold politics and will never compromise .
Inevitably , then , there will be a clash with these legislators . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien Chan 's</ENAMEX> burden
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien Chan</ENAMEX> is elected , the party - politics issues most deserving of attention will be whether this hastens the demise of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New Party</ENAMEX> and whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> party organization and the government can move together in step .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien</ENAMEX> is seen as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng - hui 's</ENAMEX> designated successor .
But , given the term system for the chairmanship of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> , after the election there will be a period of time in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> remains party chairman , while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien</ENAMEX> is president .
In the past , state policy has always been decided by the party chairman .
Observers are very curious about whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> has in fact changed , or whether we will see a repeat of what happened back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</ENAMEX> :
At that time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yen Chia - kan</ENAMEX> was president , but national policy was in fact determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Ching - kuo</ENAMEX> , whose authority derived from his post as party chairman and who took the position of premier from which to oversee day - to - day policy - making .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Hsien - jen</ENAMEX> analyzes the situation , if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien Chan</ENAMEX> is elected , there will indeed be a transition period in his relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng - hui</ENAMEX> .
But this is not necessarily a bad thing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> .
Consider , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX> , the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">James Soong 's</ENAMEX> candidacy has raised the specter of a party split .
A victory for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> continuing as party chairman , would be helpful to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> in resolving internal party disputes , and in consolidating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien</ENAMEX> 's party and government position .
He says that it is unlikely that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yen</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang</ENAMEX> situation would be repeated , since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng - hui</ENAMEX> will certainly not have an office like premier which would involve him in day - to - day policy - making .
What would a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien</ENAMEX> victory mean for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New Party</ENAMEX> ?
Remember that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NP</ENAMEX> was organized primarily out of opposition to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng - hui</ENAMEX> .
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien Chan</ENAMEX> can escape from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> 's shadow , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New Party</ENAMEX> would lose its original purpose , and members could possibly return to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> , restoring the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - party system that reigned before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NP</ENAMEX> was formed .
Another significant possibility is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New Party</ENAMEX> members , who tend to support <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> , could organize a brand - new political party with remnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> backers after the election .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shao Tsung - hai</ENAMEX> , a professor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Chengchih University</ENAMEX> and a campaign staffer for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> , states : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> has reiterated that he personally has no intention of organizing a new political party after the election .
But the political forces that support him will necessarily have to organize themselves in some fashion .
Moreover , after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng - hui</ENAMEX> leaves the scene , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NP</ENAMEX> no longer has that fixation , the possibility of establishing a new party with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> 's other supporters -LRB- who by no means necessarily dislike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> -RRB- increases .
If this happens , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New Party</ENAMEX> will no longer be in decline as it is now , but will re-emerge as a force to be reckoned with , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> will be looking at a true <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> - party system .
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien Chan</ENAMEX> is elected , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> will continue to hold both executive power and a legislative majority , and the premier will serve simply as the chief of staff to the president .
However , based on current public opinion polls , it appears that whoever wins , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien</ENAMEX> included , will be only a " plurality president , " without a strong mandate to rule .
To a certain degree , then , he will have to accommodate other political forces .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Chun - hung</ENAMEX> , who knows the legislative environment very well , explains : " Even now in order to pass important legislation there must be compromise and negotiations .
It will be virtually impossible for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> to railroad through legislation under the leadership of a president who does n't enjoy majority public support . "
The need for compromise could be further increased by the proposed law currently under discussion to put all party assets in blind trust .
This would , at least on paper , reduce the financial leverage the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> would have over its legislators , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> representatives could become even more difficult for the party to control .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien Chan</ENAMEX> may face the problem of being unable to enforce the decisions of the party center .
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> wins . . . .
Many supporters of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> are people dissatisfied with the current state of the main parties .
It is generally believed that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> wins the election , this could spark a dramatic reorganization of party politics .
The main blow could fall on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New Party</ENAMEX> , which could find itself made irrelevant , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> also strongly affected .
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> wins , it is considered virtually inevitable that his supporters will organize some sort of political organization .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shao Tsung - hai</ENAMEX> says frankly that , even if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> himself does not lead the way , his supporters - faced with the reality of party politics in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> - would have to organize in order to coordinate their operations .
At the same time , according to public opinion surveys , an extremely high percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NP</ENAMEX> members support <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> .
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> wins , it would be logical for these people to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NP</ENAMEX> and join forces with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> backers , thereby gutting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New Party</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NP</ENAMEX> secretary - general <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Ben - nan</ENAMEX> states : " As early as <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , the leadership realized that our party could potentially disappear " if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> wins .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> is the closest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> main candidates to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NP</ENAMEX> ideals , thus putting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NP</ENAMEX> in a dilemma .
The party nominated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Ao</ENAMEX> to maintain the party profile , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NP</ENAMEX> leadership still calls on party members to support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Li</ENAMEX> , but also says it will understand if its members vote for another candidate .
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> wins , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> could also be thrown into crisis .
In this election , several leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> figures have publicly come out in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> , and have been expelled from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> as a result .
Though these could be explained away as individuals who were not able to satisfy their personal ambitions inside the party , there are also many still in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> who secretly are pro-Soong .
If elected , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> will have a wealth of government resources with which to attract even more people to openly support him , and this could be the straw that breaks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> 's back .
Based on this logic , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin Wen - cheng</ENAMEX> says that an era of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> - party politics is on the way .
Though it is impossible to say whether such a situation would be stable , for those who are dissatisfied with the current choices and who want a reshuffling of party politics in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , this is the opportunity to create a fresh climate .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Chun - hung</ENAMEX> suggests that , in addition to uncertainty in party politics , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> victory could also bring instability to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's constitutional system .
Except for some of his followers who were with him in the provincial government , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> 's camp lacks any experience in inter-group political bargaining .
With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> as president , political elites in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> would be , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Lu</ENAMEX> describes it , like a basketball team whose players have never played together before .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> 's camp will <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> have to integrate their own internal views , and then , to win confidence and trust from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Legislative Yuan</ENAMEX> , work with both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> .
Such a situation is unlikely to result in much policy innovation , and in fact even the initial step of selecting a premier could prove extremely difficult .
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NP</ENAMEX> all have legislators who might join the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> camp if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> wins , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> 's team will still need support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> and/or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> , support they can only get through negotiation .
Past experience has shown that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DPP</ENAMEX> can work together to boycott <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Executive Yuan</ENAMEX> proposals ; if they do this to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> - led executive branch , this could lead to a crisis ending in either a vote of no confidence or dissolution of the parliament .
The possibility of a constitutional crisis looks much greater under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> than under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Shui - bian</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lien Chan</ENAMEX> .
The " he 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of us " effect
Few voters can see the significance of this election for party politics .
In this atmosphere of choosing among " individual heroes " rather than parties , voters are more concerned about the candidates ' characters and deportment than they are about their policy views or party backgrounds .
That is why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong</ENAMEX> , who early on was significantly ahead of his rivals in public opinion polls , saw a dramatic drop in support after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chung Hsing Bills</ENAMEX> scandal broke .
Meanwhile , newspapers and TV are filled with negative advertising in which candidates sling mud at one another .
These ads are giving voters the impression that the nation 's future leaders are all " bad apples . "
This not only marks the deterioration of electoral culture , but is a serious blow to morale in the nation and society .
The effects may prove to be far - reaching .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Chun - hung</ENAMEX> adds that negative election tactics , which after all may be seen in any democratic country , are not - bad as they are - the biggest threat .
He says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> voters should most be on the lookout for the " <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of us " effect .
Mobilization of votes based on ethnicity or provincial origin is the cheapest route to victory .
This has long been a tactic used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> elections .
As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's ethnic groups are pitted against one another politically .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin Wen - cheng</ENAMEX> states that in terms of daily life , differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's ethnic groups have largely disappeared .
But , because ethnic cleavages are constantly being exploited in elections , inter-group political conflict remains serious .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin</ENAMEX> contends : " It is inevitable that minority groups in any society feel insecure about their status .
In the last election for the mayor of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> , it was obvious that virtually all mainlanders voted for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ma Ying - jeou</ENAMEX> .
Because the majority <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> do not feel threatened , they were less likely to vote based on provincial origin , giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ma</ENAMEX> enough cross-over votes to beat out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Shui - bian</ENAMEX> .
In this upcoming election , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Soong</ENAMEX> [ who is a mainlander ] is also getting a lot of support from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> people , who sympathize with his outsider status and remember his support for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hakka</ENAMEX> identity . "
Unfortunately , however " natural " it is that minority groups feel insecure , exploitation of these cleavages for electoral gain can only have a negative long - term impact on society as a whole .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</ENAMEX> election , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> will not only be choosing a new leader .
It will also be choosing a new direction for party politics , and will help decide future relations between the two sides of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Taiwan Strait</ENAMEX> and between ethnic groups in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
How can people make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ?
How can they monitor their new leader to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ?
These are not only questions for this election , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .
