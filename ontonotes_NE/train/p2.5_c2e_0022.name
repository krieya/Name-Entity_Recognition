First of all , state - owned enterprises sold old and obsolete equipment at low prices to some individual private enterprises -LRB- this was of course done through acquaintances in most cases -RRB- .
Given all aspects of " preferential treatment , " some early individuals engaging in transportation , spare parts refurbishment , and simple processing emerged as the first " wealthy households " in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">80s</ENAMEX> .
Enterprise reforms first started with small and medium - sized enterprises , and then the policy of " invigorating the large enterprises while relaxing control over the smaller ones " was implemented .
Then through preferential policies and methods such as " substitution of tax payment for profit delivery , " " appropriation instead of loan , " " using loans to exchange for stocks , " " contracting , " and " joint capital , " small and medium - sized enterprises were basically transformed into different modes of ownership such as " privately owned , " " joint venture , " or joint stock systems .
Now we have reached the stage of reforming and fortifying large state - owned enterprises .
During the process of economic restructuring , economic theories such as " marrying off the pretty girls first , " " popsicle theory , " " rotten apples theory , " " price theory , " and " social - wealth - is - tilted - toward - the - elites theory " all began to make their presence one after another ,
Among the various theories , what stood out was the word " sell . "
Dominated by the word " sell , " we sold factories , schools , hospitals , land , labor , resources , environment ..... .
In the series of selling off , state assets have been greatly diminished , and privileges and corrupt elements have left no stone unturned
