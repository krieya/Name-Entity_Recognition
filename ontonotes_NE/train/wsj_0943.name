Under the agreement , which had been widely expected , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bell Atlantic</ENAMEX> would be buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Control Data 's</ENAMEX> customer base and its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 100</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> maintenance facilities in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 33</ENAMEX> cities .

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Vassiliades</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bell Atlantic 's</ENAMEX> customer services division , said the acquisition would give the company 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sorbus</ENAMEX> computer - maintenance unit added expertise in `` the increasingly sophisticated workstation and high - end mainframe technologies .
