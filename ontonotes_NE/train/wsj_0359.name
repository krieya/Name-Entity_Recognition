Wary investors have been running for the stock market 's equivalent of bomb shelters , buying shares of gold - mining and utility companies .
Those <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> groups have recently been leading the list of stocks setting new highs .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only a dozen</ENAMEX> common stocks hit <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">52 - week</ENAMEX> highs on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> were gold - mining issues , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another four</ENAMEX> were utilities .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a mere seven</ENAMEX> common stocks managed new highs , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> were utilities or golds .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> glance , gold and utilities seem strange bedfellows .
After all , gold prices usually soar when inflation is high .
Utility stocks , on the other hand , thrive on disinflation , because the fat dividends utilities pay look more attractive when prices are falling -LRB- or rising slowly -RRB- .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> groups have something very important in common : They are both havens for scared money , stocks for people who hate stocks .
It 's as if investors , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few days</ENAMEX> , are betting that something is going to go wrong -- even if they do n't know what .
If the stock market and the economy catch their breath and show that they 're on firmer footing , these stocks might well fall back .
Indeed , that happened to some extent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , as industrial stocks rebounded , partly on news of takeovers in the paper industry .
Still , a lot of investors clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares .
`` The primary overriding thing is that people are frightened , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Sass</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> money manager .
`` The aftershocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 13</ENAMEX> -LRB- when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average dropped 190 points -RRB- are still reverberating . ''
Certainly , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 13</ENAMEX> sell - off did n't settle any stomachs .
Beyond that , money managers and analysts see other problems .
Inventories are creeping up ; car inventories are already high , and big auto makers are idling plants .
Takeover fever has cooled , removing a major horse from the market 's cart .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's unsettled political scene also worries some investors .
`` The gyrations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> government '' add political uncertainty on top of high inflation and a ragged stock market , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hoffman</ENAMEX> , assistant director of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Smith Barney , Harris Upham -AMP- Co</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> major markets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">world</ENAMEX> is getting chewed up pretty bad . ''
`` If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> does not come to the rescue and produce lower short - term interest rates over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 30 days</ENAMEX> , the market 's going to flounder , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Wachtel</ENAMEX> , a market analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential - Bache Securities</ENAMEX> .
With this sort of sentiment common , it 's natural for investors to seek out `` defensive '' investments .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Utilities</ENAMEX> are a classic example : Even in recessions , people continue to use electric power , water and gas at a fairly steady rate .
Such defensive issues as food , tobacco , and drug stocks have been in favor for some time .
But many of these stocks have now become expensive .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wachtel</ENAMEX> points to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coca - Cola Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PepsiCo Inc.</ENAMEX> as examples : They 're selling for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 to 22</ENAMEX> times estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> per - share earnings .
Gold stocks are n't cheap on this basis , either , with many selling for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> times earnings or more .
Even utility stocks are n't all that inexpensive , at an average of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</ENAMEX> times earnings .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> groups represent a further step in defensiveness .
If gold stocks and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">utilities</ENAMEX> continue to lead , it may signal that the market is in for rough times .
That 's just what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Granville</ENAMEX> expects .
`` We are going to explode lower , '' says the flamboyant market seer , who had a huge following <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</ENAMEX> back .
`` Anyone telling you to buy stocks in this market is technically irresponsible .
You do n't want to own anything long except gold stocks . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> reason for his gloom is a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> tally he keeps of stocks within a point of hitting new highs or lows .
Last <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</ENAMEX> stocks on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> hit new <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">12 - month</ENAMEX> lows .
But by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Granville</ENAMEX> 's count , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">493</ENAMEX> issues were within <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> point of such lows .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Stovall</ENAMEX> , a veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> money manager and president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Stovall / Twenty - First Securities</ENAMEX> , has money in both gold and utility issues .
`` I think we could very well have -LCB- an economic -RCB- slowdown , beginning very soon if not already , '' he says .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stovall</ENAMEX> does n't expect an actual recession .
But he does expect `` a muffler dragger '' of an economy , with `` very slow growth , maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one quarter</ENAMEX> of no growth at all . ''
In such a climate , utility stocks look good to him .
He favors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FPL Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Florida Progress Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TECO Energy Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wisconsin Energy Corp.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dominion Resources Inc</ENAMEX> .
The appeal of gold issues , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stovall</ENAMEX> says , is that `` they 're a counter group .
You go into them because they move counter to the general market . ''
He adds that gold stocks had been down so long they were `` ready for a bounce . ''
His favorites are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Barrick Resources Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Echo Bay Mines Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coeur d'Alene Mines Corp</ENAMEX> .
Nevertheless , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stovall</ENAMEX> emphasizes that `` you do n't buy -LCB- gold stocks -RCB- based on powerful fundamentals . ''
In addition to having high price - earnings ratios , most pay puny dividends , if any .
`` The earning power -LCB- of gold mining companies -RCB- is restricted unless the gold price hops up over $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">425</ENAMEX> an ounce , '' he says .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abby Cohen</ENAMEX> , an investment strategist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> , also thinks it makes sense to have some money in both utilities and gold .
`` My outlook is for a decline of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 %</ENAMEX> in corporate profits '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> , she says .
But `` a bunch of utilities '' should post profit increases .
Among utilities , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> currently favors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Entergy Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Public Utilities Corp</ENAMEX> .
As for gold , she notes that it usually rises when the dollar is weak , as it has been lately .
Among gold stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> likes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Battle Mountain Gold Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Newmont Gold Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Freeport - McMoRan Gold Co</ENAMEX> .
