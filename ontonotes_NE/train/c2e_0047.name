<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frozen Time</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Leap - Year Day</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frozen Time</ENAMEX>
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 23rd of the twelfth month of the lunar year</ENAMEX> , we celebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">leap - year day</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Spring Festival</ENAMEX> is getting closer and closer .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of us are busy doing our makeup and our hair .
Custom has it that you should not get your hair cut in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first month of the lunar year</ENAMEX> ,
And before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Spring Festival</ENAMEX> there are more people than usual getting their makeup and hair done .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abing</ENAMEX> laughingly allowed me to go on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the second day of the second month</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> dragons raise their heads to get my hair cut .
In the evening I had nothing to do , so I decided to look for someone to gamble with .
I called a friend , but he had just moved into a new home .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">leap - year day</ENAMEX> his father - and mother - in - law were gathered with his family at his house to make jiaozi , so it appears we ca n't get together for gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> !
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tutu</ENAMEX> and I went home and ate a great meal , I lit some candles , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of us celebrated the holiday .
The custom of paying respects to the Kitchen God .
According to traditional custom , every year on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 23rd of the last month of the lunar year</ENAMEX> , the Kitchen God is supposed to ascend to Heaven and report to the Jade Emperor on this home 's good things and bad for the Jade Emperor to reward or punish .
So when they pray to the Kitchen God , people place sweets , fresh water , black beans , and hay on a table in front of the Kitchen God 's image ; the last <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> of these are for the horse that the Kitchen God rides to Heaven .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening of the 23rd of the twelfth lunar month</ENAMEX> , you 're supposed to place a tray of candied melon on the table .
This is because you hope the Kitchen God will eat his fill of sweets and then " tell good things in Heaven and bring good fortune when he returns . "
After you put the candied melon on , you take down the image of the Kitchen God that was hung above the stove <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</ENAMEX> and burn it at the side of the stove ; then you wait until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 30th</ENAMEX> when you put up the spring couplets and hang a new Kitchen God in the original place , and you hang up a couplet with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> line saying " Ascend to Heaven and tell good things " and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> line reading " Return and bring good fortune , " and the horizontal saying is " Ruler of This Home . "
Then you also put an incense burner there and every time you celebrate a festival you light incense and pray for happiness .
Folk custom says that men do not worship the moon and women do not sacrifice to the Kitchen God , so it is only the men who make these sacrifices to the Kitchen God .
Legend .
A long time ago , there was a well - to - do family named Zhang ; in middle age , they had a son .
The husband and wife gave their son the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Guisheng</ENAMEX> , and later people called him <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Sheng</ENAMEX> .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Sheng</ENAMEX> grew up , he liked to eat , was lazy , and he often went gambling , so the old husband and wife decided to marry him off and let their daughter - in - law manage him .
They sent someone to propose this marriage to a comely girl in the village named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guo Dingxiang</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingxiang</ENAMEX> soon came to live with them , but after the marriage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Sheng 's</ENAMEX> behavior worsened .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingxiang</ENAMEX> persuaded and cajoled , but in the end she was beaten and kicked by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Sheng</ENAMEX> .
Not long after , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> aggrieved elders passed on .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> day , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingxiang</ENAMEX> rolled out a bowlful of long , fine noodles and waited for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Sheng</ENAMEX> to return to eat , and she took the opportunity to again urge him to change his ways , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Sheng</ENAMEX> pushed the bowl away and left .
After this , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Sheng</ENAMEX> threw out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingxiang</ENAMEX> , sold off the family possessions and land , and spent his days living a life of dissipation .
After being thrown out , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingxiang</ENAMEX> went to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South Mountain</ENAMEX> .
There she spent her days clearing land and planting crops , and in the evening she wove ; after years of arduous toil , she became a wealthy woman with <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a hundred mu</ENAMEX> of fine land .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Sheng</ENAMEX> had sold off all his possessions , he began to beg for a living .
Only then did he repent , and he thought of how worthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingxiang</ENAMEX> was .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> day , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingxiang</ENAMEX> saw a beggar enter her courtyard , and she realized it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Sheng</ENAMEX> .
Good - hearted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingxiang</ENAMEX> took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Sheng</ENAMEX> into the kitchen and with her own hands gave him a bowl , setting it on the table .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Sheng</ENAMEX> saw this bowl of long , thin noodles and knew he had come begging to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingxiang</ENAMEX> 's home ; feeling ashamed , he smashed his head into the stove and killed himself .
Later <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">the Jade Emperor</ENAMEX> made him the Kitchen God and put him above the stove so he could watch other people eat but not eat himself , and told him that was his punishment .
