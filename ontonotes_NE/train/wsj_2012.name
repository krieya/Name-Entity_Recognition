<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> plans to restructure itself more like a private corporation .
In addition , the tax - collecting agency says that it will take the unusual step of looking to the private sector to fill <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> new high - level positions to guide the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">120,000</ENAMEX> - employee agency : a comptroller to oversee <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> finances and a chief information officer to update the information system , which includes probably the largest computer data base in the world .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> also said that it would create the position of chief financial officer , who will be hired from within the agency .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> Commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred T. Goldberg</ENAMEX> said the changes are intended to bring `` accountability '' to the agency , which has an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> budget of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 5 billion</ENAMEX> and collects <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 trillion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</ENAMEX> .
`` My assessment and everyone 's assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that let us responsibly and effectively formulate and execute our budget , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX> said .
`` And we do n't have internal controls and discipline that we need to have to spend <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion</ENAMEX> properly . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX> , who took over as head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> , has been disturbed by what he considers the inefficiency , waste and lack of coordination among the branches of the vast federal agency .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> operates on a computer system designed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</ENAMEX> , which it has been trying to modernize for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> .
And the agency , which operated throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1989</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 360 million</ENAMEX> budget shortfall , has been under a hiring freeze since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last fall</ENAMEX> .
The new commissioner says that closer scrutiny of how the agency uses its resources will go a long way toward enhancing its ability to collect more tax revenue .
`` I think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget formulation and execution process which , in turn , I believe will result in a significant increase in revenue , '' he said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> hopes to fill the new positions soon .
Customarily , it would appoint career civil servants from within the agency , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX> said he plans to `` scour the world '' for the chief information officer and the comptroller .
Although the jobs will probably pay <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 70,000 and $ 80,000</ENAMEX> a year , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> officials are confident that they can attract top - notch candidates from the private sector .
`` You 're telling someone they can spend <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next three or four or five or six years</ENAMEX> of their life bringing about the most difficult and costly modernization of an information system on the civil side ever , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX> said .
`` On the comptroller side , you 're developing and making work financial controls governing a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion</ENAMEX> budget .
