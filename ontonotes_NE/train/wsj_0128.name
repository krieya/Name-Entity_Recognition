Wall Street 's big securities firms face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered .
The reason : Risks from the firms ' new `` merchant banking '' activities are rising as revenue from the industry 's traditional business erodes .
The downgrading of debt issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CS First Boston Inc.</ENAMEX> , parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moody 's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> , coupled with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moody 's</ENAMEX> announcement that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX> is under review for a possible downgrade , sent shivers through the brokerage community <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> .
With the shudders came the realization that some of Wall Street 's biggest players are struggling to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably .
Securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper , or short - term corporate IOUs , which they sell to finance their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> operations .
The biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moody 's</ENAMEX> warned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson</ENAMEX> 's commercial paper rating could be lowered soon , a move that would reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson</ENAMEX> 's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62 %</ENAMEX> - owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express Co</ENAMEX> .
`` Just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980s</ENAMEX> bull market transformed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> securities business , so too will the more difficult environment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher T. Mahoney</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moody</ENAMEX> 's vice president .
`` A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Standard -AMP- Poor 's Corp.</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Boston</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> , in particular , are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months ahead</ENAMEX> .
What worries credit - rating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking long - term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy - out and junk bond financings .
That 's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors .
Whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly , Wall Street 's new penchant for leveraged buy - outs and junk bonds is resulting in long - term lending commitments that stretch out for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> .
`` The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer - term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays '' in getting their money back , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Bowman</ENAMEX> , a vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">S-AMP-P</ENAMEX> , which raised a warning flag for the industry in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April</ENAMEX> when it downgraded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CS First Boston</ENAMEX> .
`` Wall Street is facing a Catch - 22 situation , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahoney</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moody 's</ENAMEX> .
Merchant banking , where firms commit their own money , `` is getting riskier , and there 's less of it to go around . ''
In addition , he says , the buy - out business is under pressure `` because of the junk bond collapse , '' meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk - bond financings shrinks .
In a leveraged buy - out , a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing , with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company 's operations or sales of its assets .
In a recent report , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moody 's</ENAMEX> said it `` expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">century</ENAMEX> in the securities industry , which , combined with overcapacity , will create poor prospects for profitability . ''
It said that the `` temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor . ''
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moody 's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">S-AMP-P</ENAMEX> cited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Boston 's</ENAMEX> reliance in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> on merchant banking , which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm 's profit .
The recent cash squeeze at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Boston 's</ENAMEX> most lucrative client of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</ENAMEX> , is proving costly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Boston</ENAMEX> because it arranged more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</ENAMEX> of high - yield , high - risk junk financings for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Campeau</ENAMEX> units .
In addition , a big loan that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Boston</ENAMEX> made to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ohio Mattress Co .</ENAMEX> was n't repaid on time when its <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 450 million</ENAMEX> junk financing for a buy - out of the bedding company was withdrawn .
`` These <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CS First Boston 's</ENAMEX> equity , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moody 's</ENAMEX> said .
`` Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm 's equity . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CS First Boston</ENAMEX> , however , benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Credit Suisse</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> largest bank .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson</ENAMEX> also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy - out business .
But its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail , or individual investor , business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1987</ENAMEX> stock market crash .
In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson</ENAMEX> 's listed <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</ENAMEX> of capital is overstated , according to the rating concerns , because it includes <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.7 billion</ENAMEX> of goodwill .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson</ENAMEX> `` really only has <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 million</ENAMEX> of capital , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">S-AMP-P</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson</ENAMEX> spokesman said the firm is n't worried .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A year ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moody 's</ENAMEX> also had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson</ENAMEX> under review for possible downgrade , '' he said .
`` After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</ENAMEX> of talks , our rating was maintained . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating .
The collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> , the leading underwriter in that market .
The firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> felonies related to a big insider - trading scandal .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> eliminated its retail or individual customer business , cutting the firm 's workforce almost in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just over 5,000</ENAMEX> .
Recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">previous years</ENAMEX> .
The firm 's capital , moreover , has n't grown at the same rate as in the past , officials at these firms say .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> remains confident of its future creditworthiness .
`` We 're well positioned with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.7 billion</ENAMEX> of capital , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> spokesman said .
`` And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm , the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view .
Moreover , we 've probably been the most aggressive firm on the Street in reducing costs , which are down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 40 %</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last six months</ENAMEX> .
