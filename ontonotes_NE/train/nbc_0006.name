<DOC DOCNO="bn/nbc/00/nbc_0006@0006@nbc@bn@en@on">
This was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</ENAMEX> that the bottom halves of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> tickets moved into the spotlight .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Thompson</ENAMEX> has been tracking them both .
The running mates -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Lieberman</ENAMEX> , running hard as the race for President enters its final month .
Some are declaring a winner in the choice for Vice President .
It 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Lieberman</ENAMEX> because he game umph to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> ticket .
He helped change the public 's perception of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> .
The man once thought a risky pick , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> candidate on a national ticket , now a political star .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GORE</ENAMEX> / <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LIEBERMAN</ENAMEX> , no bull , no pork .
Laughter .
Humanizing the sometimes robotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hadassah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tipper</ENAMEX> and I are together , we call this double dating .
Using an informal style to draw voters in , even when on the attack .
Does Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> now want to do for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's environment what he has done here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> ?
I hope not .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> could not be more different .
The former cabinet member and oil industry executive so formal and business - like on the campaign trail , critics complain some appearances have all the excitement of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Defense Department</ENAMEX> briefing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> have had every chance and every reason to improve our schools , to raise taxes , to save <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> , but they have n't even tried .
The so - called safe pick quickly became the controversial one .
News reports about failing to vote in some elections and moving slowly to answer questions about his <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">multi-million dollar</ENAMEX> CEO retirement package , reasons why some analysts consider him to be a flop .
That 's until <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Thursday night 's</ENAMEX> debate .
I think by any standard , his debate performance was very , very good , and I put him back in the asset column now .
Conventional wisdom is running mates do n't make a difference .
In a race this close , could <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lieberman</ENAMEX> sway the all - important undecided voters ?
Saddened to learn --
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> gives substance in style .
Each side hoping this time it will make a difference in a race still too close to call .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Thompson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC News</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
