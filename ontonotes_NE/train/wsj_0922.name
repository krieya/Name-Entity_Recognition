<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western European</ENAMEX> leaders who favor speedy economic and monetary union are adding a new argument to their arsenal : the dizzying political changes under way in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francois Mitterrand</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">European Community Commission</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Delors</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Spanish</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe Gonzalez</ENAMEX> and others have begun linking the rapid changes in the East to the need to speed up changes in the West .
They are stressing that the best way for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> is to move faster towards <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western European</ENAMEX> economic and monetary unity .
This would make the market - oriented system more attractive to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Eastern</ENAMEX> countries , they argue , and allow greater economic aid and technological know - how to flow from West to East .
`` The only response to the challenge being presented to us by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitterrand</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Parliament</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Strasbourg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , `` is to reinforce and accelerate the union and cohesion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Community</ENAMEX> . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitterrand</ENAMEX> proposed that a conference be convened <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next fall</ENAMEX> to write a new treaty for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> allowing a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> central bank , and that the treaty be ratified by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitterrand</ENAMEX> also proposed a separate `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bank for Europe</ENAMEX> '' that would channel development money to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> basis for linking change in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> and change in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> is the notion that integrating <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Eastern Europeans</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">320 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western Europeans</ENAMEX> is primarily the task of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Europeans</ENAMEX> , despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's obvious strategic and economic interest .
Says a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> strategist : `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> tends to look at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> -LCB- not including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> -RCB- as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> looks at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Latin America</ENAMEX> : important but far away .
But for us in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Western Europe</ENAMEX> , these are <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Europeans</ENAMEX> next door . ''
A reintegrated <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> implies big changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">40 - year - old</ENAMEX> military and economic policies .
There is likely to be a natural division of labor , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francois Heisbourg</ENAMEX> , director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Institute for Strategic Studies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> more engaged in strategic issues with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Western Europe</ENAMEX> more involved with specific aid measures for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> .
The designation at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> 's economic summit of major industrialized nations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the EC Commission</ENAMEX> as coordinator of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> step .
In part , this division is dictated by economics : <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> is a net exporter of capital while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> is n't .
While <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> aid efforts have been limited by budget problems , yesterday <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> announced a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">four billion French franc</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 650 million</ENAMEX> -RRB- aid plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> .
Despite sudden changes in the strategic equation , some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western European</ENAMEX> leaders , especially <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> , remain skeptical about <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> political and economic unity , and are unlikely to let <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> - West concerns change their minds .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> analysts are beginning to link the issues .
`` We need a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> Ostpolitik , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Roper</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Royal Institute of International Affairs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> , referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany 's</ENAMEX> longstanding policy of a diplomatic opening to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> .
`` For <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> we need to think about a stick - and - carrot economic approach that would force them to price things realistically in return for removing all our tariff barriers . ''
He notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Marshall Plan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> `` did n't just throw money at post-war <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , it also liberalized and opened up those markets . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> analysis goes further .
`` Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> 's leaders have finally concluded that we all want perestroika -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's policy of economic restructuring -RCB- to succeed , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubert Vedrine</ENAMEX> , security adviser to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitterrand</ENAMEX> .
`` But they have n't yet drawn the operational policy conclusions . ''
He adds that with communism collapsing and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> scrambling to rejuvenate the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> economy , `` Our interest lies in a controlled transformation , a contained nuclear reaction , so we need to help him , and not just with words . ''
Managing change , he adds , will require a lot more aid and a prominent role for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> , especially in dealing with the question of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> reunification .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thierry de Montbrial</ENAMEX> , director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the French Institutue for International Relations</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> , says it is n't clear what , exactly , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> wants .
Any push for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> vision of a `` common <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> home , '' implying the eventual dissolution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> - German partnership and the withdrawal of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> forces , `` would be a very , very serious problem , '' he says .
He doubts a Bismarckian super state will emerge that would dominate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , but warns of `` a risk of profound change in the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Community</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> that is too strong , even if democratic . ''
He adds : `` We , and the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> have to talk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Germans</ENAMEX> , now , frankly and raise these future risks with them . ''
While many commentators , particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> ones , worry that hasty and emotional reaction to the changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> might lead to dangerous pressures for a denuclearized <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> or the speeded - up withdrawal of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> troops , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roper</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> sees a more positive scenario .
`` There seems to be a message from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> there 's a deal on offer , '' he says .
`` They want reassurance we wo n't try to undermine or destroy <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Warsaw Pact</ENAMEX> ... .
In return , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> could keep their nuclear weapons .
He adds : `` Once both sides feel comfortable , it should be that much easier to make more progress toward the economic and social reforms that are now starting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> .
