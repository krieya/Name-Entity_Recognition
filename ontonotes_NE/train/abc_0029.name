We are going to take `` a closer look '' at the great <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Wind Cave</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX> .
No easy matter .
We know caving is a popular pasttime for some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> , a horrifying thought for others , especially anyone prone to claustrophobia .
We asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy Muller</ENAMEX> if she would like to do the story of a fascinating man .
She took a deep breath and said , okay .
This wild landscape in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX> may evoke images of the frontier <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> , but the real frontier is far beneath .
Elevation plus <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</ENAMEX> .
The real pioneers are men like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sheltons</ENAMEX> who explore underground caves .
The most fascinating is the maze known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Wind Cave</ENAMEX> .
When you find one where no one has been there , you are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> person , the adrenaline is phenomenal .
He first came here as a tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years ago</ENAMEX> .
He offered to map it for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Park Service</ENAMEX> .
I thought would take a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> .
It 's now <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</ENAMEX> down the road .
I 'm no closer to completing the agreement .
The cave is seemingly endless .
<ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</ENAMEX> of the cave have been surveyed , every inch logged by hand , then fed into a computer which plots every nook and cranny .
We 're only representing about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> of the known volume that could possibly be here .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 %</ENAMEX> of the cave is unmapped ?
Yes .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> recorded discovery of the cave was in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1881</ENAMEX> .
A cowboy hunting in the area heard the sound of rushing wind .
He followed it to this narrow opening .
The wind was so strong , or so the story goes , that it blew his hat off his head .
Since then , many visitors have been drawn into this world of crystals , fossils and calcite formations known as forecast work and popcorn and rarest of all , fox work .
Each new discovery means heading down another tight , dark hall .
Your stomach is against the floor and your back is against the wall .
As we crawled along , we found an item left by earlier explorers .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">103 - year - old</ENAMEX> newspaper .
The ultimate payoff is when they find a new chamber .
The knowledge that our lights are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> to light it up , our footprints were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> , our eyes were first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> to see it .
He calls it addictive .
You get withdrawal .
I want to find more , something bigger or deeper .
He no longer expects to see the end of the cave in his <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</ENAMEX> .
That , he says , is just fine with him .
