A song that just could n't be any older .
Back in the days when band combinations were popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , there was a band called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">blue jeans</ENAMEX> .
I 've heard some of their songs , and I do n't like them much , for example , that very famous song , " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How Can It Be This Way</ENAMEX> . "
I , as a person , do n't have much ambition , so when I listen to music , the best is purely to get away from reality , stuff like Utopia , the Garden of Eden , fantasy or sweet nothings is just fine .
I definitely do n't want any critiques on modern society 's wrong practices .
So , even though I love <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Tat Ming Pair</ENAMEX> , their " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ten Young Firefighters</ENAMEX> , " ah , and " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In No Particular Order</ENAMEX> , " ah , all of which are n't my taste .
But then one day I heard the song " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rainy Day</ENAMEX> , " and could n't believe that this was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Jeans</ENAMEX> song where they lay down arms and turn romantic .
This feeling is like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BLUR</ENAMEX> 's " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">TO THE END</ENAMEX> " or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Rolling Stones '</ENAMEX> " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">AS TERAS GOES BY</ENAMEX> . "
They say a strong man who can show his emotions is a special treasure .
Even if it 's not manly , it 's impossible to forget .
You do n't have to have a broken heart to go and listen to " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rainy day</ENAMEX> . "
There 'll always be more of a market for sad songs ; they have more power to hurt .
It 's a hoarse voice very much like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu Guanting 's</ENAMEX> , it 's very deep
