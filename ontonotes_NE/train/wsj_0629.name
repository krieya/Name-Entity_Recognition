In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bombay</ENAMEX> stock market circles , the buzzword is `` mega . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 40</ENAMEX> companies are coming to the capital market to raise <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion</ENAMEX> , an amount never thought possible in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> .
`` When they talk mega-issues , they 're truly talking mega , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.A. Dave</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Securities and Exchange Board of India</ENAMEX> .
`` The capital market is booming . ''
But the mega-issues are raising megaquestions about the rapidly evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> capital market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> is whether there is enough money to fund the new issues without depressing stock trading .
Moreover , in the relatively unregulated <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> stock markets , investors frequently do n't know what they are getting when they subscribe to an issue .
A prospectus in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> does n't always tell a potential investor much .
Some of the large amounts are being raised by small firms .
In addition , once money is raised , investors usually have no way of knowing how it is spent .
Some analysts are concerned that the mega-issues , in such an unregulated environment , could lead to a mega-crash .
`` The rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the mega-projects , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.S. Patel</ENAMEX> , a former chairman of the giant , government - run mutual fund , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Unit Trust of India</ENAMEX> .
`` They 're going to have mega-problems . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> stock markets have been on a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year</ENAMEX> high , with dips and corrections , since Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rajiv Gandhi</ENAMEX> started liberalizing industry .
But the last stock market boom , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> , seems small compared with the current rush to market .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion</ENAMEX> that some <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</ENAMEX> companies are looking to raise in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year ending March 31</ENAMEX> compares with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 2.7 billion</ENAMEX> raised on the capital market in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous fiscal year</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1984</ENAMEX> , before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> came to power , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 810 million</ENAMEX> was raised .
This <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> 's biggest issue , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 570 million</ENAMEX> of convertible debentures by engineering company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Larsen -AMP- Toubro Ltd.</ENAMEX> , is the largest in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> history .
And it is n't the only giant issue : together , the top <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> issues will raise <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</ENAMEX> .
Convertible debentures -- bonds that can later be converted into equity shares -- are the most popular instrument <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , though many companies are also selling nonconvertible bonds or equity shares .
These mega-issues are being propelled by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> factors , economic and political .
In the past , the socialist policies of the government strictly limited the size of new steel mills , petrochemical plants , car factories and other industrial concerns to conserve resources and restrict the profits businessmen could make .
As a result , industry operated out of small , expensive , highly inefficient industrial units .
When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> came to power , he ushered in new rules for business .
He said industry should build plants on the same scale as those outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and benefit from economies of scale .
If the output was too great for the domestic market , he said , companies should export .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> 's overregulated businessmen had to be persuaded , but they have started to think big .
Some of the projects being funded by the new issues are the first fruits of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> 's policy , and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past .
The industrial revolution has produced an explosion in the capital market , which is a far cheaper source of funds than government - controlled banks , where interest rates for prime borrowers are around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> factor spurring mega-issues is political .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> has called general elections for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> , and many businessmen fear that he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- Party will lose .
Some companies are raising money in anticipation of a government less predictable than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> 's , and possibly more restrictive .
The buoyant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bombay</ENAMEX> rumor mill also says that some of the money raised in the current spate of issues will be used as campaign donations before the elections .
No one admits to anything , but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> 's industrialists have a history of making under - the - table campaign donations .
So far , the mega-issues are a hit with investors .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tata Iron -AMP- Steel Co. 's</ENAMEX> offer of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 355 million</ENAMEX> of convertible debentures was oversubscribed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Essar Gujarat Ltd.</ENAMEX> , a marine construction company , had similar success with a slightly smaller issue .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Larsen -AMP- Toubro</ENAMEX> started accepting applications for its giant issue <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this month</ENAMEX> ; bankers and analysts expect it to be oversubscribed .
Still to come are big issues by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bindal Agro Chem Ltd.</ENAMEX> , a petrochemical and agrochemical company , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Usha Rectifier Corp .</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a semiconductor maker .
While many investors are selling parts of their portfolios to buy the new issues , prices on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</ENAMEX> stock exchanges are holding up so far .
`` I do n't think it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patel</ENAMEX> , `` only a sagging tendency . ''
Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.J. Pherwani</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Unit Trust of India</ENAMEX> : The `` markets are headed for growth unheard of and unseen before . ''
But with growth come growing pains , and never has this been clearer on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> capital market than now .
In the past , the government controlled the markets indirectly , through its tight grip on industry itself .
Various ministries decided the products businessmen could produce and how much ; and government - owned banks controlled the financing of projects and monitored whether companies came through on promised plans .
The government has been content with this far - reaching , subtle form of control , exercised on a case - by - case basis with no clear rules or guidelines .
But now , with large amounts being raised from investors , the government 's dawdling on regulation and disclosure requirements has a more dangerous aspect .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Securities and Exchange Board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> was set up <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> , along the lines of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Delhi</ENAMEX> has n't pushed the legislation to make it operational .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave</ENAMEX> , its head , acts cheery and patient , but he makes no bones about the need to get to work .
`` Mega or non-mega , we feel the prospectus standards need to be considerably improved , '' he says .
`` Disclosures are very poor in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> . ''
He says the big questions -- `` Do you really need this much money to put up these investments ? Have you told investors what is happening in your sector ? What about your track record ? -- `` are n't asked of companies coming to market .
Instead , he says , most investors have to rely on the rumor - happy <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> press .
An example is the biggest offering of them all , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Larsen -AMP- Toubro 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 570 million</ENAMEX> bond issue .
The engineering company was acquired in a takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> by the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Reliance</ENAMEX> textile group .
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Larsen -AMP- Toubro</ENAMEX> had n't raised money from the public in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">38 years</ENAMEX> , its new owners frequently raise funds on the local market .
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Reliance</ENAMEX> floated a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 357 million</ENAMEX> petrochemical company in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> that was , at the time , the largest public issue in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> history . -RRB-
The media has raised questions about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Larsen -AMP- Toubro 's</ENAMEX> issue , pointing out that it exceeds the company 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> sales and its market capitalization .
Even stranger is the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Usha Rectifier</ENAMEX> , a semiconductor company with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28 million</ENAMEX> that 's raising <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 270 million</ENAMEX> to build an iron plant .
Once the money is raised , it is n't always certain how it is used .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Larsen -AMP- Toubro</ENAMEX> , for example , says it 's raising <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 570 million</ENAMEX> to use as supplier credit on large engineering jobs .
Unlike other companies , it has n't pin - pointed specific projects for the funds .
And even when specific projects are described in prospectuses , the money often is used elsewhere , according to analysts .
`` Someone must monitor where the funds are deployed , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patel</ENAMEX> agrees : `` There is no proper monitoring and screening of the use of these funds .
They 're trying to plug the various loopholes , but they 're totally unprepared for this . ''
Because of the large amounts of money being raised , the loose disclosure requirements and the casual monitoring of how the money is used , some analysts fear that there could be a few mega-crashes , which could hurt market confidence far more than the small bankruptcies that followed the boom of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> .
The government insists that such a possibility is low .
It says that despite loose regulation of the market itself , its longstanding regulation of industry will prevent such crashes .
