An enormous turtle has succeeded where the government has failed : He has made speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> respectable .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 1/2 - foot - tall</ENAMEX> turtle , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pong Pagong</ENAMEX> , is a character who stars in the children 's television show `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Batibot</ENAMEX> . ''
He speaks only in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Batibot</ENAMEX> , '' which started in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</ENAMEX> as a hybrid of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> program `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sesame Street</ENAMEX> , '' has developed into a distinctly <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Philippine</ENAMEX> effort .
Radio programs and books have followed the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> television show .
In the process , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Batibot</ENAMEX> , '' an archaic <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> word meaning `` strong '' or `` enduring , '' has become a powerful advocate of the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> language .
`` It impresses on ordinary , young <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Filipinos</ENAMEX> that there 's nothing to feel inferior about in using their own language , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy David</ENAMEX> , a sociologist and host of a popular television talk show .
`` When we started the program <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six years ago</ENAMEX> , the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> was deemed unwise by the predominantly middle class , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lydia Brown</ENAMEX> , the program 's creator .
Now , she says , `` it 's no longer an issue . ''
The success of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Batibot</ENAMEX> '' stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> as a national language .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> -- once known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Pilipino</ENAMEX> -- is predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Tagalog</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX> - based language spoken in a part of the country 's principal island of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Luzon</ENAMEX> .
Resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country 's elite , who generally prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> .
But while better - off <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Filipinos</ENAMEX> are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> , they are often slow to reveal that they are prejudiced against <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> , say advocates of the native language .
`` For the middle and upper - middle class -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> -RCB- is declasse , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bien Lumbera</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Philippine</ENAMEX> - studies professor at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quezon City 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">University of the Philippines</ENAMEX> .
There 's also resentment .
Other opponents of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> come from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE" S_OFF="4">non-Tagalog</ENAMEX> regions .
They argue that their own languages should have equal weight , although recent surveys indicate that the majority of the country 's population understands <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> more than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> .
-LRB- There are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> major languages and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 70</ENAMEX> dialects in the country . -RRB-
What tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> .
It is entrenched in the country 's colonial bonds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Philippine</ENAMEX> class structure , in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography .
As they did when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> was a colony of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , teachers for the most part teach in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> , even though it is a foreign language for most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Philippine</ENAMEX> children .
As a result , they often speak <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> language at home , another at school .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> calls the modern - day cultural ambivalence to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> a `` language schizophrenia . ''
The issue has been simmering for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> .
It does n't take much to provoke an intense debate .
When President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corazon Aquino</ENAMEX> , whose command of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> is spotty , announced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> that the language would be used in official communications , there was an uproar from many legislators , who continue to conduct debates mostly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> .
But many proponents of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> see resistance to the language finally crumbling .
They believe the media , including `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Batibot</ENAMEX> , '' have played a crucial role .
According to chief scriptwriter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rene Villanueva</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Batibot</ENAMEX> '' does n't set out to advance the cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's not as if we 're teaching language per se , '' he says , `` We 're just using it . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Batibot</ENAMEX> '' is produced in a converted lumberyard on a shoestring budget of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,000</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">one - hour</ENAMEX> segment .
It is shown <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekdays</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of the country 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> networks .
With an audience totaling <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 400,000</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Batibot</ENAMEX> '' consistently ranks in the country 's top - <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> most - watched <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</ENAMEX> programs .
But advertising revenue is inadequate .
Periodically , there are threats that the program will fold .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Batibot</ENAMEX> '' lacks the polish of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sesame Street</ENAMEX> . ''
Sound stages echo .
Acting sometimes falls flat .
There are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</ENAMEX> large puppets in the program : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pong Pagong</ENAMEX> and a monkey named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kiko Matsing</ENAMEX> .
But the production is the equal of any local program .
And the show 's creativity makes up for any technological deficiencies .
The program is n't afraid to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear weapons and the environment .
Not that the language war is won , even on `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Batibot</ENAMEX> . ''
During <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> recent episode , all the advertisements were in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> .
