The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> rejected a constitutional amendment that President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> sought to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> flag from desecration .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 - 48</ENAMEX> roll call fell well short of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two - thirds</ENAMEX> majority needed to approve changes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> .
The vote , in which <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> lawmakers voted against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's position , was a victory for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> leaders , who opposed the amendment as an intrusion on <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Bill of Rights</ENAMEX> .
`` We can support the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> flag without changing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> .
In order to defuse pressure for an amendment , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Foley</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wash .</ENAMEX> -RRB- had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before voting on the constitutional change .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said he would allow the bill to become law without his signature , because he said only a constitutional amendment can protect the flag adequately .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> threw out the conviction of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> man who set a flag afire during a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> demonstration , saying he was `` engaging in political expression '' that is protected by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the First Amendment</ENAMEX> .
