Hello , everyone .
I 'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holly Firfer</ENAMEX> , sitting in for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy Fortin</ENAMEX> .
Here 's our top story --
As <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> bury their dead , the violence in the streets of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mideast</ENAMEX> continues , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> leaders begin a meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> , trying to develop a unified position on the whole situation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptian</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hosni Mubarak</ENAMEX> opened the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Arab League</ENAMEX> summit with a statement blaming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> for adopting a belligerent attitude which threatens the essence of peace .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Palestinian Authority</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat</ENAMEX> accused <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> of `` mass killing and barbarian bombing . ''
He called on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> leaders to take a stand `` befitting the sacrifices '' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> people .
Our choice is the choice of permanent , comprehensive and just peace , and our aim is to liberate our land and to create our independent state in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> blast land with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> as its capital and the return of our refugees to their homes .
While leaders and spokesmen for both sides talk , the fighting goes on .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Blystone</ENAMEX> reports on the latest round of violence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mideast</ENAMEX> .
The studied words of the diplomats and the cries in the street seem to come from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> different worlds .
Fresh clashes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Gaza Strip</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> coast and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the West Bank</ENAMEX> .
Fighting springs from the funerals for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least nine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> killed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> in some of the worst clashes in this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - week</ENAMEX> conflict .
A new intifada , successor to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - year</ENAMEX> street campaign that ended with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> / <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> negotiations <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade ago</ENAMEX> , according to a leader of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fateh</ENAMEX> movement .
A counterview from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Meridor</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's defense and foreign affairs committee .
When I hear the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> saying on television we are at the war of independence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> , I understand they prefer war to peace .
A stupid and difficult historic mistake , but we have to face it .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Overnight</ENAMEX> , a new development on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's northern border .
The defense reports an attack at the border fence .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> body was found after <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> responded with small arms , tanks and helicopters from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> movement which waged a war of attrition with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> before they withdrew from south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May</ENAMEX> , says its fighters were not involved .
As the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</ENAMEX> wear on , the words of diplomats and leaders seem more and more irrelevant .
Reaction follows reaction .
The initiative is in the streets .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Blystone</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The U.N. General Assembly</ENAMEX> has passed a resolution that is critical of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's use of force against <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> .
It also condemns <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> excessive use of force by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> .
It calls <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> settlements in the occupied territories illegal and an obstacle to peace .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</ENAMEX> nations abstained from the vote .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</ENAMEX> others oppose the measure , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> .
They say it sends a negative message .
