The crowning moment in the career of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph F. O'Kicki</ENAMEX> came as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</ENAMEX> local and state dignitaries packed into his elegant , marble - columned courtroom here <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> for his swearing in as President Judge of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambria County</ENAMEX> .
Baskets of roses and potted palms adorned his bench .
The local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Legion</ENAMEX> color guard led the way .
As the judge marched down the center aisle in his flowing black robe , he was heralded by a trumpet fanfare .
To many , it was a ceremony more befitting a king than a rural judge seated in the isolated foothills of the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Allegheny Mountains</ENAMEX> .
But then Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> often behaved like a man who would be king -- and , some say , an arrogant and abusive one .
While his case may be extreme , it reflects the vulnerability of many small communities to domineering judges .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last March</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nine months</ENAMEX> after the judge 's swearing - in , the state attorney general 's office indicted him on a sweeping array of charges alleging <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 10 years</ENAMEX> of `` official oppression '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambria County</ENAMEX> , a depressed steel and mining community in western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> .
The allegations , ranging from theft and bribery to coercion and lewdness , paint a disquieting picture .
According to testimony in a public , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</ENAMEX> - page grand - jury report handed up to the state attorney general , Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> extorted cash from lawyers , muscled favorable loans from banks and bullied local businesses for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a decade</ENAMEX> .
Prosecutors , in an indictment based on the grand jury 's report , maintain that at various times since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</ENAMEX> , he owned a secret and illegal interest in a beer distributorship ; plotted hidden ownership interests in real estate that presented an alleged conflict of interest ; set up a dummy corporation to buy a car and obtain insurance for his former girlfriend -LRB- now his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> wife -RRB- ; and maintained <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</ENAMEX> accounts in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> banks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambria County</ENAMEX> .
In testimony recorded in the grand jury report , court employees said the judge , now <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">59 years old</ENAMEX> , harassed his secretaries , made imperial demands on his staff and hounded anyone who crossed him .
Bailiffs claimed they were required to chauffeur him to and from work , mow his lawn , chop his wood , fix his car and even drop by his house to feed his <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> grown mutts , Dixie and Husky .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> former bailiff charged that the judge double - crossed him by reneging on a promise of a better paying job after pocketing a $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">500</ENAMEX> bribe .
Some of the allegations are simply bizarre .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> former secretaries told the grand jury they were summoned to the judge 's chambers on separate occasions to take dictation , only to find the judge in his bikini underwear .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> secretary testified that the judge once called her to his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">office</ENAMEX> while wearing nothing at all .
The judge , suspended from his bench pending his trial , which began <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> , vehemently denies all the allegations against him , calling them `` ludicrous '' and `` imaginative , political demagoguery . ''
He blames the indictment on local political feuding , unhappiness with his aggressive efforts to clear the courthouse 's docket and a vendetta by state investigators and prosecutors angered by some of his rulings against them .
`` I do n't know whose toes I 've stepped on , '' says the judge .
`` I 'll find out , eventually , who pushed the state police buttons into action . ''
Even if only some of the allegations stand up , however , they provide ample testimony to the awesome power of judges in rural communities .
That power can sometimes be abused , particularly since jurists in smaller jurisdictions operate without many of the restraints that serve as corrective measures in urban areas .
Lawyers and their clients who frequently bring business to a country courthouse can expect to appear before the same judge <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> .
Fear of alienating that judge is pervasive , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Geiger</ENAMEX> , founder and director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Rural Justice Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montpelier</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vt.</ENAMEX> , a public interest group that researches rural justice issues .
As a result , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geiger</ENAMEX> , lawyers think twice before appealing a judge 's ruling , are reluctant to mount , or even support , challenges against him for re-election and are usually loath to file complaints that might impugn a judge 's integrity .
Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> , a stern and forbidding - looking man , has been a fixture in the local legal community for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than two decades</ENAMEX> .
The son of an immigrant stonemason of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Slovenian</ENAMEX> descent , he was raised in a small borough outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ebensburg</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambria County</ENAMEX> seat , and put himself through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of Pittsburgh Law School</ENAMEX> .
He graduated near the top of his class , serving on the school law review with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Thornburgh</ENAMEX> , who went on to become governor of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and , now , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> Attorney General .
It was also in law school that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> wife had the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> daughters .
He divorced his first wife <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</ENAMEX> and married the daughter of his court clerk .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pennsylvania Supreme Court</ENAMEX> Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John P. Flaherty</ENAMEX> called Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> one of the finest judges `` not only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> but in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> . ''
Clearly , the judge has had his share of accomplishments .
After practicing law locally , he was elected to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> term as judge in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</ENAMEX> ; in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> , he was effectively re-elected .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Six years ago</ENAMEX> , Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> was voted president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Pennsylvania Conference of State Trial Judges</ENAMEX> by the state 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</ENAMEX> judges .
He has been considered several times for appointments to federal district and appellate court vacancies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> .
And when he ran unsuccessfully for a state appellate court seat in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Pennsylvania Bar Association</ENAMEX> rated him `` one of the best available , '' after interviewing local lawyers .
`` He probably was the smartest guy who ever sat on our bench , '' says a former president of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambria County 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</ENAMEX> - member bar association , who , like most lawyers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambria County</ENAMEX> , refuses to talk about the judge publicly .
`` He 's sharp as a tack .
He could grasp an issue with the blink of an eye . ''
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a decade</ENAMEX> , virtually no one complained about Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> .
`` What about those institutions that are supposed to be the bedrock of society , the banks and the bar association ... ? '' wrote a columnist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Tribune - Democrat</ENAMEX> , a newspaper in nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johnstown</ENAMEX> , shortly after the scandal became public .
`` If only a banker or a lawyer had spoken out <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</ENAMEX> , the judicial process would n't be under the taint it is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> . ''
Officials with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Pennsylvania Judicial Inquiry and Review Board</ENAMEX> , the arm of the state that investigates judicial misconduct , counter that they had no inkling of anything amiss in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ebensburg</ENAMEX> .
`` Nobody told us ; nobody called us , '' says an official close to the case who asked not to be named .
`` Nobody had the guts to complain . ''
Certainly not the lawyers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johnstown</ENAMEX> attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard J. Green Jr.</ENAMEX> shelled out $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">500</ENAMEX> in loans to the judge over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> , he said in testimony to the grand jury .
`` The judge never made a pretense of repaying the money , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> .
Eventually , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> testified , he began ducking out of his office rather than face the judge when he visited .
When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> won a $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">240,000</ENAMEX> verdict in a land condemnation case against the state in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1983</ENAMEX> , he says Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> unexpectedly awarded him <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 100,000</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> thought little of it , he told the grand jury , until the judge walked up to him after the courtroom had cleared and suggested a kickback .
`` Do n't you think I ought to get a commission ... or part of your fee in this case ? '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> said the judge asked him .
Appalled , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> never paid the money , he testified .
But he did n't complain to the state 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Judicial Inquiry and Review Board</ENAMEX> , either , saying later that he feared retribution .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> said he will respond to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> 's allegation at his trial .
Like most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambria County 's</ENAMEX> lawyers and residents who had dealings with the judge , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> declined to be interviewed for this article .
And no one with a complaint about the judge would allow his name to be printed .
`` I do n't have anything much to say , and I think that 's what you 're going to find from everyone else you talk to up here , '' says local attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward F. Peduzzi</ENAMEX> .
Says another lawyer : `` The practice of law is a matter of biting one 's lip when you live in a small community .
One had best not dance on top of a coffin until the lid is sealed tightly shut . ''
The judge was considered imperious , abrasive and ambitious , those who practiced before him say .
He sipped tea sweetened with honey from his high - backed leather chair at his bench , while scribbling notes ordering spectators to stop whispering or to take off their hats in his courtroom .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Four years ago</ENAMEX> , he jailed all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</ENAMEX> members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Cambria County School Board</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</ENAMEX> after they defied his order to extend <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the school year</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</ENAMEX> to make up for time lost during a teachers ' strike .
Visitors in his chambers say he could cite precisely the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">days</ENAMEX> remaining until mandatory retirement would force aside the presiding president judge , giving Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> the seniority required to take over as the county 's top court administrator .
The judge , they say , was fiercely proud of his abilities and accomplishments .
`` My name is judge , '' Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> told a car salesman in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ebensburg</ENAMEX> when he bought a new red <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pontiac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sunbird</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1984</ENAMEX> , according to the grand - jury report .
The dealership dutifully recorded the sale under the name `` Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> . ''
Yet , despite the judge 's imperial bearing , no one ever had reason to suspect possible wrongdoing , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bognato</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambria County 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</ENAMEX> - member bar association .
`` The arrogance of a judge , his demeanor , the way he handles people are not a basis for filing a complaint , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bognato</ENAMEX> .
`` Until this came up and hit the press , there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong . ''
State investigators dispute that view now , particularly in light of the judge 's various business dealings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambria County</ENAMEX> .
The judge came under scrutiny in late <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , after the state attorney general 's office launched an unrelated investigation into corruption in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambria County</ENAMEX> .
The inquiry soon focused on the judge .
Even his routine business transactions caused trouble , according to the grand jury report .
When the judge bought his new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sunbird</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">James E. Black Pontiac - Cadillac</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ebensburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</ENAMEX> , the dealership had `` certain apprehensions '' about the judge 's reputation , according to the grand - jury report .
The dealership took the extra step of having all the paper work for the transaction pre-approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ebensburg</ENAMEX> 's local lender , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Laurel Bank</ENAMEX> .
Then , as an additional precaution , the car dealership took the judge 's photograph as he stood next to his new car with sales papers in hand -- proof that he had received the loan documents .
But when the judge received his payment book , he disavowed the deal .
`` There was no loan , there is no loan , there never shall be a loan , '' the judge wrote the bank on his judicial stationery , according to the report .
Later , the judge went a step farther .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Laurel Bank</ENAMEX> tried to repossess the car , a vice president asked him to intervene in an unrelated legal dispute involving a trust account .
The judge wrote again .
`` I find myself in an adversary relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Laurel Bank</ENAMEX> , and I am not inclined to extend myself as far as any favors are concerned , '' the judge wrote back in a letter attached to the grand jury 's report .
`` Perhaps if my personal matters can be resolved with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Laurel bank</ENAMEX> in the near future , I may be inclined to reconsider your request ... . ''
The judge now says it was `` unfortunate '' that he chose to write the letter but says `` there was certainly no intent to extort there . ''
The bank acquiesced .
It refinanced the judge 's loan , lowered its interest rate and accepted a trade - in that had n't originally been part of the deal -- a beat up <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chevy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Citation</ENAMEX> the dealer had to repair before it could be resold .
The incident was n't the only time the judge got special treatment from his local bank .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years later</ENAMEX> , he wrote to complain that the interest he was paying on an unsecured $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000</ENAMEX> loan was `` absolutely onerous . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul L. Kane</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Laurel</ENAMEX> 's president at the time , quickly responded .
The bank , he wrote back , was `` immediately '' lowering the rate by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5 %</ENAMEX> , `` as a concession to you . ''
The judge says he ca n't discuss in detail how he will defend himself at his trial , although he contends that if he were as corrupt as state prosecutors believe , he would be far wealthier than he is .
His <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> - bedroom cedar and brick house outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johnstown</ENAMEX> is up for sale to pay for his lawyers .
The judge says he is confident he will return to his old bench .
Already , he notes , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</ENAMEX> charges originally filed against him have been trimmed to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</ENAMEX> .
Most of the allegations no longer pending were ethics charges withdrawn by state prosecutors as part of a pre-trial agreement .
The heart of the case -- `` official oppression '' -- remains intact .
`` If I lose , I lose my position , my career , my pension , my home and my investments , '' says the judge .
`` My God and I know I am correct and innocent .
