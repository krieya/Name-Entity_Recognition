Researchers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Telephone -AMP- Telegraph Co. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bell Laboratories</ENAMEX> reported they raised the electrical current - carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> , moving the materials closer to commercial use .
The scientists said they created small changes in the crystal - lattice structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">600,000 amps per square centimeter</ENAMEX> in a moderately strong magnetic field .
The scientists said they made the advance with yttrium - containing superconductors cooled to liquid - nitrogen temperature , or <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit</ENAMEX> .
Their report appears in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's issue of the journal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nature</ENAMEX> .
The finding marks a significant step in research on `` bulk '' superconductors , which are aimed at use in wires for motors , magnets , generators and other applications .
Scientists had obtained even higher current - carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors , but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry .
Superconductors conduct electricity without resistance when cooled .
A family of ceramic superconductors discovered during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</ENAMEX> promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation -- but only if their current - carrying capacity can be raised .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> advance shows how one aspect of the current - carrying problem can be overcome .
But `` it wo n't lead to imminent use '' of new superconductors , cautioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert B. van Dover</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> researchers .
He added that the current - carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so - called weak links between crystals .
Such multi-crystal materials will probably be needed for commercial applications .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Dover</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> team created the desired crystal changes by bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons , a process that creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for large - scale commercial use .
Still , scientists breathed a collective sigh of relief about the finding , because it demonstrates how to overcome the `` flux pinning '' problem that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors ' potential .
The problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals , limiting their current - carrying capacity .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Dover</ENAMEX> said the crystal changes his team introduced apparently pins the magnetic fields in place , preventing them from lowering current - carrying capacity .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Dover</ENAMEX> added that researchers are trying to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem .
Determining that may enable them to develop better ways to introduce the needed crystal - lattice patterns .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AT-AMP-T</ENAMEX> team also is trying to combine their latest superconductor process with `` melt - textured growth , '' a process discovered earlier at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bell Laboratories</ENAMEX> .
The combined processes may significantly raise the current - carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples .
