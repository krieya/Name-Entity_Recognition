<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Avis Inc.</ENAMEX> , following rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hertz Corp.</ENAMEX> 's lead , said it is backing out of frequent - flier programs with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> airlines .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garden City</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , car - rental company said it wo n't renew contracts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NWA Inc. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX> unit , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pan Am Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pan American World Airways</ENAMEX> unit and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Midway Airlines</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of this year</ENAMEX> .
But it remains involved in programs with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AMR Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Airlines</ENAMEX> unit and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Delta Air Lines</ENAMEX> .
Industry estimates put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Avis</ENAMEX> 's annual cost of all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> programs at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 8 million and $ 14 million</ENAMEX> .
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Avis</ENAMEX> would n't specify the costs but said the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> airlines being dropped account for `` <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">far less than half</ENAMEX> '' of the total .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Budget Rent a Car Corp.</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Car Rental Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> , both said they had no plans to follow suit .
In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Budget</ENAMEX> indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs , in which renters earn frequent - flier miles and fliers can get car - rental discounts .
`` I can not see how this news by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hertz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Avis</ENAMEX> can not benefit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Budget</ENAMEX> 's programs , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Wilson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Budget</ENAMEX> 's vice president , marketing planning .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Northwest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Midway</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> airlines with which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Budget</ENAMEX> has agreements .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National</ENAMEX> also participates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Northwest</ENAMEX> frequent - flier program along with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> other airlines , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Delta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USAir Group Inc. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USAir</ENAMEX> unit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A month ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hertz</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Park Ridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , said that it would drop its marketing agreements at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year end</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Delta</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">America West</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Air Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Continental Airlines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern Airlines</ENAMEX> , and that pacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Airlines</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL Inc 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Airlines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USAir</ENAMEX> also would be ended ... sometime after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 31</ENAMEX> .
At the time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hertz</ENAMEX> said its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> fees to those airlines amounted to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</ENAMEX> and that the value of redeemed awards topped <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</ENAMEX> .
Analysts and competitors , however , doubt the numbers were that high .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Budget</ENAMEX> said its frequent - flier costs are `` substantially below '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Avis</ENAMEX> 's level .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert D. Cardillo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Avis</ENAMEX> vice president of marketing , said , `` The proliferation and costs attached to -LCB- frequent - flier programs -RCB- have significantly diminished their value . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</ENAMEX> has been difficult for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hertz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Avis</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Finnie</ENAMEX> , car - rental industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Alex . Brown -AMP- Sons</ENAMEX> .
`` They 've been looking to get their costs down , and this is a fairly sensible way to do it , '' he said .
