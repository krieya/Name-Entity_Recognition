THE SALES PITCH could n't sound better .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , there 's the name : `` asset - backed securities . ''
Better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing .
And there 's more .
The assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions .
Most earn high ratings from credit agencies .
Their yields are higher than those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX> issues .
And the booming market has already attracted many of the nation 's biggest institutional investors .
Ready to jump ?
Well , think twice .
The concept may be simple : Take a bunch of loans , tie them up in one neat package , and sell pieces of the package to investors .
But the simplicity may be misleading .
Skeptics say the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk .
They warn that asset - backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate .
Moreover , the securities were introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only about 4 1/2 years ago</ENAMEX> ; the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession .
`` A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen Carney</ENAMEX> , director of the investment securities division of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> comptroller of the currency .
`` We do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn . ''
Such concerns , however , have n't stopped asset - backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street 's hottest new products .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring of 1985</ENAMEX> , financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities .
They have sold issues backed by car loans , boat loans and recreational - vehicle loans .
They have offered bundles of homeequity loans , as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time - shares .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , there was an issue of `` death - backed bonds '' -- securities backed by loans to life - insurance policyholders .
Some predict there will be `` Third World bonds , '' backed by loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX> and other debt - ridden nations .
And the biggest volume <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> has been on securities backed by credit - card receivables , sometimes known as `` plastic bonds . ''
`` This is the heyday of debt , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Grant</ENAMEX> , editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grant 's Interest Rate Observer</ENAMEX> , a newsletter .
`` Before the sun sets on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the '80s</ENAMEX> , it seems nothing will be left unhocked . ''
The result is a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 45 billion</ENAMEX> market , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Securities Data Co</ENAMEX> .
That includes <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 9.5 billion</ENAMEX> issued through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August of this year</ENAMEX> , up sharply from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.5 billion</ENAMEX> in the comparable <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> period -- and more than in all of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> .
Most issues have been sold to professional money managers , pension funds , bank trust departments and other institutions .
But wealthy individuals also have been jumping in , and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset - backed market .
The entry fee is affordable : Issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> .
`` We expect additional offerings '' of asset - backed securities targeted toward individual investors , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Addiss</ENAMEX> , a senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ENAMEX> .
The process typically begins when an institution , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citibank</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sears , Roebuck -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , takes a pool of credit - card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust .
The trust then issues securities -- generally due in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years or less</ENAMEX> -- that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors .
Issues typically come with `` credit enhancements , '' such as a bank letter of credit , and thus have received high credit ratings .
Enthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers , while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions .
Asset - backed securities `` are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig J. Goldberg</ENAMEX> , managing director and head of the asset - backed securities group at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ENAMEX> .
But skeptics question whether asset - backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks .
Consider a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</ENAMEX> offering of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> securities issued <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last spring</ENAMEX> and backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citibank</ENAMEX> credit - card receivables .
The triple - A - rated issue offered a yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 0.5</ENAMEX> percentage point above <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> issues .
On a $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000</ENAMEX> investment , that 's a difference of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 50</ENAMEX> a year .
That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street .
But for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have , that margin is meaningless .
`` If you 're in the bond business playing the relative - performance derby , then even an extra <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</ENAMEX> basis points -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</ENAMEX> percentage point -RRB- becomes an important consideration on a career basis , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grant</ENAMEX> .
`` But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again , then that is n't of overwhelming importance . ''
Moreover , the interest on asset - backed securities is fully taxable , while interest on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> issues is tax - free at the state and local level .
That 's why some investment managers , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Powers</ENAMEX> , a vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chase Manhattan Bank 's</ENAMEX> private banking division , do n't recommend most asset - backed issues for individuals in high - tax states , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powers</ENAMEX> has purchased asset - backed issues for individuals with tax - deferred accounts , such as retirement plans .
He points out that institutions buying asset - backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasurys</ENAMEX> than individuals buying smaller amounts .
Another concern is liquidity , or how easily a security can be converted into cash .
The secondary , or resale , market for asset - backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> issues .
That could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature .
That 's particularly true , analysts say , for certain of the securities , such as those backed by time - share loans .
`` You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan S. Paris</ENAMEX> , a vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">European Investors Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> investment - management firm .
In addition , an investor who wants to know the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds , or corporate bonds traded on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , can simply check newspaper listings .
There are n't any such listings for asset - backed securities .
Evaluating asset - backed securities poses another problem .
Investors , for instance , may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities .
It is n't .
The front cover of the prospectus for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citibank</ENAMEX> credit - card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and `` do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citibank N.A.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citicorp</ENAMEX> or any affiliate thereof . ''
In other words , if there 's a problem , do n't expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citibank</ENAMEX> to come to the rescue .
The prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency .
That means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities , as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received .
That also is n't easy .
Take the `` credit enhancements , '' which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond - insurance company .
The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities .
Nor does it cover the entire portfolio .
Details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue .
Still , they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset - backed issues -- which in turn is why the yield above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasurys</ENAMEX> is so slim .
But skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government - guaranteed paper .
When you buy an asset - backed issue , you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties .
If a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of , say , its loans to Third World nations , that could also affect the ratings , liquidity and prices of the asset - backed issues that the bank supports .
Underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions .
But despite the credit enhancements , despite the high ratings , some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets .
At a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> are leveraged to their eyeballs , asset - backed investors may be taking a heady gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times .
At the very least , a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest - quality bonds they can find -- that is , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasurys</ENAMEX> .
That could widen the yield spread between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasurys</ENAMEX> and asset - backed securities , as well as make it tougher to unload the latter .
But it could be much worse .
Some analysts are especially wary of credit - card issues .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing , credit - card loans are unsecured .
In addition , they fear that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public -- giving cards to too many big spenders who will default during a recession .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A day</ENAMEX> of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest - quality debt issues , and therefore we think the best debt investment is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government bonds , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig Corcoran</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Davis / Zweig Futures Inc.</ENAMEX> , an investment advisory firm .
What about triple - A - rated asset - backed issues ?
`` Nope , we still say to stick with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasurys</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corcoran</ENAMEX> replies .
Ratings , he notes , `` are subject to change . ''
All this makes asset - backed securities seem too risky for many people .
And it reminds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond F. DeVoe Jr.</ENAMEX> , a market strategist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.</ENAMEX> , of what he calls `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeVoe</ENAMEX> 's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> :
`` More money has been lost reaching for yield than in all the stock speculations , scams and frauds of all time . ''
