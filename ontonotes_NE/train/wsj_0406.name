-LRB- During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">its centennial year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past century</ENAMEX> that stand as milestones of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> business history . -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">MAY 1 , 1975 ,</ENAMEX> SIGNALED A DISTRESSFUL <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May Day</ENAMEX> for securities houses , which were forced to end <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">183 years</ENAMEX> of charging fixed commissions .
It scared brokers , but most survived .
It took effect after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</ENAMEX> of bitter debate between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> and traders and exchanges .
Despite warnings from such leaders as former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William McChesney Martin</ENAMEX> that unfixed commissions would undo the industry , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1973</ENAMEX> said full competition must start <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May l , 1975</ENAMEX> .
The timing for change was right .
Institutions had become active market players in the early <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1970s</ENAMEX> and sought exchange seats to handle their own trades .
And the industry was rife with brokers trying to secure big client orders by using kickbacks , gifts , women and junkets .
Within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</ENAMEX> end to fixed rates there were all - out price wars among brokers fighting for institutional business , with rate slashes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 % to 60 %</ENAMEX> below <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE" S_OFF="4">pre-May 1</ENAMEX> levels .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Garrett Jr.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> chairman , said the `` breadth and depth of the discounting is more than I expected . ''
Even a federal measure in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> allowing houses to add research fees to their commissions did n't stop it .
Longer term , the impact is unclear .
The change prompted the rise of discount brokers and a reduction in securities research firms .
But there are currently more exchange members than in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</ENAMEX> , with the bigger houses gaining a larger share of total commissions .
Commissions , however , account for a smaller share of investment - house business as takeover advisory fees have soared .
Foreign stock markets , with which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> is entwined , also have ended fixed commissions in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
It came in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> 's `` Big Bang '' <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> deregulation ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> 's `` Little Bang '' <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> is currently phasing out fixed commissions under its `` Le Petit Bang '' plan .
