<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abd al - Bari Atwan</ENAMEX> : -LRB- President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> -RRB- Great in His Life .. Great in His Martyrdom
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asad</ENAMEX>
1/02/2007
This unprecedented <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> and international interest in the execution of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> and the barbaric way in which it was carried out , confirms the importance of the man , his prominent status , and his distinguished role in the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> region .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> administration , who planned carefully for this event through experts in media and public relations , and its tools in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and the inclinations of public opinion did not at all expect such an opposite result , which along with the destructive consequences that may result from it in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming days</ENAMEX> have caught them by surprise .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> proceeded to the gallows like a proud mountain , with head raised , standing upright , looking down at the insignificant things and insignificant people , believing in his creed and his <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabism</ENAMEX> , repeating slogans of pride and dignity , after he confirmed his faith .
He confirmed it by repeating verses from the noble <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Koran</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> testimonies .
He will be envied by all <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arab</ENAMEX> leaders , both living and dead , for this honorable martyrdom , and this enormous love in the midst of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of millions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> all over the different parts of the world .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> was the only leader in the modern history of this nation who went to the guillotine because he was a patriot who refused occupation and surrender to the invasion , and chose resistance .
The only ones who preceded him in this honor were men like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Umar al - Mukhtar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yusuf al - Azma</ENAMEX> , by whose struggle the nation and its history were honored , and kept it for them in the records of pride and dignity .
They hastily executed him because they feared him even when he was behind bars , just as they will still fear him as a corpse hidden under the soil of the homeland , and comparisons between his time and their bloody and chaotic time always came in his favor , and the calls for his return to save <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> from its crisis and the corrupt and malicious gang that governs it have become deafening to the ears of the occupation and its accomplices .
He embarrassed them and dwarfed them by standing as a spear in the prisoner 's dock .
They were terrified by the penetrating looks of his eyes .
They were exposed by his patriotism and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabism</ENAMEX> and his contempt for the odious sectarian divisions that they planted in their contaminated new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
So they decided to get rid of him with a confused and embarrassing hastiness .
Thanks to the technology of the mobile phone which enabled us to recognize the ugly face of the hateful sectarianism that is governing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
This tape exposed the government of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Green Zone</ENAMEX> , and blew up all the plans for censorship and fraud by the experts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> Intelligence service and their agents .
It presented us with the naked truth , without that being the intention of its owner .
He was right when he turned to them and said , " Are these your men ? " when they were directing insults at him while he was proceeding to the gallows in magnanimity and with self - respect , repeating the noble words , " and when the ignorant address them they say ' peace . ' "
Is it manliness to shout hateful sectarian slogans in front of a man who has never been sectarian , and the rope of the gallows is being wound around his neck , and his soul will go to its Creator in a few seconds ?
Are these the tolerant ethics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Islam</ENAMEX> ?
Are these the values of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabism</ENAMEX> , decency , and pride ?
Are those the sons of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> which had always stood up against invaders throughout history and was a pillar of support for its nation and the causes of justice in the world as a whole ?
We are sorry , but not surprised , because some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> governments objected only because the execution took place on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day of the feast of Bairam</ENAMEX> , as if the execution of this man would have been permissible and blessed on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">any other day</ENAMEX> .
We are sorry again because most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> leaders hid in their palaces and none of them dared to speak even <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> word of protest out of fear of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> .
We were stabbed twice , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> when we watched an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> leader being led to the gallows in accordance with sectarian justice which is spiteful and vengeful . And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> time when we did not see anyone among the club of leaders to which he belonged for more than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> years object to his execution .
Maybe God wanted a good end for him , and a good reputation , when He induced <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of them to record what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and the government of sects wanted to hide , by means of the video of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">last</ENAMEX> moments , which created a historic turning point that will perhaps shape the history of the region , and the nature of events in it for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">decades to come</ENAMEX> .
Maybe God wanted to expose the series of lies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muwaffaq al - Rabi</ENAMEX> the National Security Advisor in the government of occupation . -LRB- Where is that security ? -RRB- , who went out to the world saying that he , meaning President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> , was weak and collapsing while he was on his way to meet his God .
Then the tape comes along and shows us with sound and image that we are in front of a courageous lion , who refuses to wear the mask , just as he refused to take the tranquilizing pills they offered him .
Why the mask , and why the pills ?
The mask is for traitors and criminals who are ashamed of their treason or their crimes , and the tranquilizing pills are appropriate for those who can not face history because of their bad deeds .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> administration committed a fatal mistake and revealed a major foolishness to be added to its many foolishnesses in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> when it executed this man , in a way for which it will pay a hefty price in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the near future</ENAMEX> .
His survival would have benefited it much more than his execution if they understood politics as they should , because his survival could have been a card to threaten the sectarians and keep them as servants to them and their schemes , just as it could have been a bargaining chip for calming down the resistance and the broad <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> sector which supports it .
But they do not know anything except grudges , and they do not want anything other than inflicting more degradation on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> by his execution .
Perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> administration will have succeeded in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing only , intentionally and with planning or without it , namely , deepening the sectarian breach not only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> but in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> world as a whole .
It was not by coincidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nouri al - Maliki</ENAMEX> signed the decision to carry out the execution .
And it was also not a matter of coincidence that the task of carrying it out was assigned to spiteful sectarians as we have seen in the videotape .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Talabani</ENAMEX> hid or fled , along with all those who participated in the project of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> occupation and gave it a legitimate cover , from the other sect .
This execution will deal a strong blow to all the efforts of national reconciliation .
It will lead to the escalation of attacks against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> forces and those cooperating with it .
It will pour more oil on the fire of the civil war that has already been kindled .
Those who carried out the death sentence do not want reconciliation or to maintain a unified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
Rather , they are working to blow it up ; tolerance , forgiveness , and patience are basic characteristics not found in those people .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> had negative traits and positive traits , but he was not killed because of his negative traits , but rather because of his positive traits , which were his belief in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> unity , resistance to the enemies of the nation , building an unprecedented industrial and educational foundation , and challenging <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> .
He chose resistance and rejected safe and luxurious exile .
The curse of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> will continue to chase them , chase the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> , and chase his spiteful sectarian executioners .
Just as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Al - Qaeda</ENAMEX> emerged from the womb of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> arrogance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> arrogance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Al - Qaeda</ENAMEX> will emerge from the womb of the degrading execution process .
