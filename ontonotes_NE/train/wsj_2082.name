The original bill was strongly opposed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> and publicly criticized by friends of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> as an attempt to undermine the central bank 's independence .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> critics , however , hailed it as a long overdue attempt to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary policy .
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> said the purpose of the meetings would be to `` improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive branch and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> . ''
