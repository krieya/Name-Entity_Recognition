We 're sorry to report that on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> accepted the resignation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Allen</ENAMEX> as chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Civil Rights Commission</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> , appointed by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> , grew understandably tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies .
His recent speech , provocatively titled `` Blacks ? Animals ? Homosexuals ? What is a Minority ? '' caused an uproar when its title leaked out .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> 's commissioners voted to call his unread speech `` thoughtless , disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory . ''
Commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Francis Berry</ENAMEX> said it was `` another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman . ''
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Edwards</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> , warned Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> that the speech would be `` outside the scope of the commission 's jurisdiction . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Stoddard</ENAMEX> , head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Lambda Legal Defense Fund</ENAMEX> , called the prospect of the speech `` frankly shocking . ''
We 've actually read the speech .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> began it with a warning to his hosts , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> church group that opposes rights for homosexuals .
He said that other participants in the conference `` do not believe that the rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> should be guaranteed to citizens who are homosexual , '' but that `` I mean to persuade you to the opposite view . ''
He recalled to the audience a `` strange , infelicitous '' analogy he once heard arguing `` now that we have finally recognized that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> blacks have rights , we need to do the same for animals .
'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> objected to this analogy because it seems to `` assimilate the status of blacks to that of animals -- as a mere project of charity , of humaneness . ''
Rights on such a basis , whether for blacks or homosexuals , are `` mere indulgences , '' he said , subject to being taken back .
He says the title of his speech was to make his point that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> have rights as individuals , not as members of certain select groups .
His speech criticized the `` idiocy of notions of protected groups in society '' as opposed to individual equality or , as he put it , in `` a common destiny as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> . ''
Instead of lobbying for special treatment , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> said that homosexuals and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk `` invidious retrenchment with government complicity . ''
This hardly sounds like an anti-homosexual screed .
What 's really going on here ?
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> most important things to understand about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> is that he is a black conservative intellectual -- a triple threat to the liberal establishment .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> , who teaches government at prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvey Mudd College</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and will remain a member of the commission , has spent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> arguing that civil rights are individuals ' rights .
He last made waves when he dared to defend an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> girl who had been adopted by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="4">non-Indian</ENAMEX> parents off her reservation .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again , which somehow elevated the vague concept of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indian</ENAMEX> rights '' above the rights of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indians</ENAMEX> .
There is a huge divide between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> 's we 're - all - in - this - together view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups .
Indeed , the gap is so large that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> 's critics refuse to engage the debate .
Their ridicule of him is no substitute for argument .
Their effort to run him out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement .
We hope the next head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Civil Rights Commission</ENAMEX> will be as brave as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> in making the case for equality of civil rights .
