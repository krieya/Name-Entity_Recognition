For the real estate industry , a watchword for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</ENAMEX> will be buy , more than build .
That 's the word expected to be on the lips of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3,000</ENAMEX> developers , pension - fund advisers and real estate financiers slated to attend a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - day</ENAMEX> conference , beginning here <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Urban Land Institute</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ULI</ENAMEX> is a non-profit research and education group based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14,000</ENAMEX> members nationwide .
With the market overbuilt , builders are finding limited opportunities and increased risks .
Developers and money managers are looking for bargains among the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of financially troubled properties around the country .
Real estate professionals now often bill themselves as `` turnaround experts '' and `` workout specialists . ''
Conference attendees are expected to be buzzing about the workings of the recently formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX> , a federal agency charged with disposing of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 200 billion</ENAMEX> of real estate dumped in government hands by insolvent savings and loans .
Developers are also eyeing the real estate portfolios of major corporations .
Some plan to pursue foreign development ventures , mostly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> .
And other developers may shift from commercial to residential development in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
`` There are n't as many economically viable alternatives for real estate developers in this country as <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years ago</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Shaw</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> - based real estate developer . ``
So developers are saying they will look into distressed properties .
They 'll go into someone else 's pasture as long as it 's greener than the one they 're in now . ''
Developers are also forming more joint ventures with pension funds and insurance companies that can finance big projects .
The builders are more willing to give up some equity and rely on management and consulting fees to stay afloat in the soft market .
`` Developers are teaming up with institutions often acting as project managers , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smedes York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ULI</ENAMEX> president and president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">York Properties Inc.</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raleigh</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.C</ENAMEX> .
`` They are growing more pragmatic about their role . ''
Real estate firms are also using their alliances with financial institutions to amass acquisition funds .
`` Why should you beat your brains out fighting the environmentalists , the neighborhood groups , dealing with traffic mitigation , sewers and fighting city hall , then try to convince a lender to lend you money in an overbuilt market when you can get pension fund money , buy a portfolio , sell off pieces off it and play your own game ? '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Rodman</ENAMEX> , managing partner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> office of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kenneth Leventhal Inc.</ENAMEX> a national accounting firm .
But experts say that when it comes to distressed properties , finding diamonds in the rough is n't easy .
The level of interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTC</ENAMEX> 's properties has been greater than expected , and has come from larger companies than initially anticipated , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan Ross</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Leventhal</ENAMEX> 's co-managing partner .
And to succeed in the turnaround business , he says , developers may have to put in a lot of money and time .
Finding pension funds and other sources willing to invest is a high priority .
Quips <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Shulman</ENAMEX> , director of real estate research for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> : `` A theme of the Urban Land conference will be ` take a pension fund manager to lunch .
