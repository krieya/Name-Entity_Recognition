As <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> grapples with its worsening economy , leading reformers have drawn up a blueprint for change designed to push the nation much closer to a free - market system .
The proposals go far beyond the current and rather confused policies of perestroika , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev 's</ENAMEX> restructuring of the economy .
They lay out a clear timetable and methodology for liberalizing the system of setting prices , breaking up huge industrial monopolies and putting unprofitable state - owned companies out of business .
They also address such taboo subjects as the likelihood of unemployment and high inflation , and recommend ways to soften the social consequences .
While many solutions to the nation 's economic troubles are being discussed , the blueprint is attracting widespread attention here because of its comprehensiveness and presumed high - level authorship .
Although it was published unsigned in the latest edition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> sources say the article was written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonid Abalkin</ENAMEX> and a small group of colleagues .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abalkin</ENAMEX> , head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Academy of Science 's Institute of Economics</ENAMEX> , was recently appointed deputy chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> government and head of a state commission on economic reform .
`` It 's clearly a manifesto for the next stage of perestroika , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> analyst .
The economic ideas in the document are much bolder than current policies .
For example , the proposed overhaul of prices -- an extremely sensitive political topic -- is far more precise than the vague plans announced by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> and later dropped .
But the proposals also display political savvy , couching some of the most controversial ideas in cautious language so as not to alienate powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">conservatives</ENAMEX> in the government who stand to lose out if they are implemented .
Seeking a middle path between opponents of change and radicals who demand <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</ENAMEX> solutions , the article advocates what it calls a `` radical - moderate approach . ''
The document is to be discussed at a conference of leading economists late this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">month</ENAMEX> , and will probably be presented to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parliament</ENAMEX> for consideration <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
As policy - makers draw up proposals for the next <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year</ENAMEX> plan , which starts in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> , the blueprint represents a powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> shot in what is likely to be a fierce battle over economic reform .
The authors make a gloomy assessment of the economy and concede that `` quick and easy paths to success simply do n't exist . ''
Instead , they map out a strategy in several phases from now until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> .
Most of the measures would probably only start to have an effect on beleaguered <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> consumers in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two to three years</ENAMEX> at the earliest .
The key steps advocated include : -- PROPERTY .
Rigid ideological restrictions on property ownership should be abandoned .
The document proposes breaking up the monolithic system of state - owned enterprises and farms and allowing a big private sector to flourish , helped by tough anti-monopoly legislation .
The economy would be thrown open to numerous types of ownership <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">between now and 1992</ENAMEX> , including factories leased by workers or owned by shareholders , cooperatives and joint ventures .
Some forms of private property would be sanctioned .
Such moves would greatly reduce the power of government ministries , who now jealously guard their turf and are seen as one of the major obstacles blocking economic reform .
-- FINANCES .
Emergency measures would be introduced to ease the country 's financial crisis , notably its <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 billion</ENAMEX> budget deficit .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of next year</ENAMEX> , all loss - making state enterprises would be put out of business or handed over to workers who would buy or lease them or turn them into cooperatives .
Similar steps would be taken to liquidate unprofitable state and collective farms by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 1991</ENAMEX> .
A unified system of taxation should be introduced rapidly .
To mop up some of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">the 300 billion rubles</ENAMEX> in circulation , the government should encourage home ownership , including issuing bonds that guarantee holders the right to purchase an apartment .
-- LABOR .
A genuine market for labor and wages would replace the present rigid , centralized system .
Departing from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> dogma , the new system would lead to big differences in pay between workers and almost certainly to unemployment .
To cushion the blows , the government would introduce a minimum wage and unemployment benefits .
-- PRICES .
The entire system of centrally set prices would be overhauled , and free - market prices introduced for most wholesale trade and some retail trade .
Consumers would still be able to buy some food and household goods at subsidized prices , but luxury and imported items , including food , would be sold at market prices .
Wholesale prices would be divided into <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> categories : raw materials sold at fixed prices close to world levels ; government - set procurement prices for a small number of key products ; and free prices for everything else to be determined by contracts between suppliers and purchasers .
Inflation - adjusted social benefits would ensure that the poor and elderly do n't suffer unduly .
-- FOREIGN TRADE .
The current liberalization and decentralization of foreign trade would be taken much further .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> companies would face fewer obstacles for exports and could even invest their hard currency abroad .
Foreigners would receive greater incentives to invest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX>
Alongside the current non-convertible ruble , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> currency would be introduced that could be freely exchanged for dollars and other Western currencies .
A domestic foreign exchange market would be set up as part of an overhaul of the nation 's banking system .
The blueprint is at its vaguest when referring to the fate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> powerful economic institutions that seem likely to oppose such sweeping plans : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Planning Committee</ENAMEX> , known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gosplan</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Committee for Material Supply</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gossnab</ENAMEX> .
But it hints strongly that both organizations would increasingly lose their clout as the changes , particularly the introduction of wholesale trade and the breakup of state monopolies , take effect .
