<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire Shipman</ENAMEX> now with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the Vice President 's day</ENAMEX> back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire</ENAMEX> ?
Sources tell us <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> has not made up his mind how far he will push the effort in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> .
Certainly what his team they say they still think they could win .
As for the courts , we 're told that decision is not likely to be made until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November 17th</ENAMEX> , when the final tally is in .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> , in a deliberate attempt to publicly relax , in the midst of tension of the highest order .
I think we 're going to win this game .
We were ahead 6 , so I 'm very optimistic .
We 're talking about the touch football game .
Sources say he and his team are also still optimistic about a win in the recount , because they believe a manual count will turn up mistakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> 's favor .
Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> team <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> asserting there is still a lot of work to be done before naming the President - elect .
I hope all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> agree the will of the people , not a computer glitch should select our next President .
I think we pledged ourselves to try to keep the rhetoric as low as possible , given the situation , and try to carry it out in a professional way .
Why ?
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> considers his options with his family , advisers say he and the campaign realize they are operating on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> distinct and delicate tracts -- legal , which they will pursue to keep options open , and political , which they have to watch carefully as they feel mounting pressure .
Friends point out that the man who was so quick to concede the first time to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> when he thought he lost and who told aides , `` we have to do this right , '' is not a politician who would insist on a long , damaging legal process , if it is determined that 's what going to court would mean .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> to talk to him , less to offer advice than support .
Finally , friends tell us <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> and his family are also focused on the --
They believe depending on what happens , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> has a strong platform right now from which to launch a presidential bid in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2000</ENAMEX> had , and that is part of the calculation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> ?
Thanks very much , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire Shipman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> .
