Well could could you enroll in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> other courses if you wanted to ?
In addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> you 're already in , are there <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> other things that you 'd also like to take ?
For example .
I do n't know what the limit is for I know there 's a limit for students who e-
%uh a limit for what ?
You know I 'm thinking a lot about this job that I just took that you know you seem to think is a dead end and obviously does n't make enough money
and you know I do n't know I 'm going to like it .
You do n't know that going into a job .
There 's
I understand that .
Well tha-
I understand that .
You 've taken it
and that 's a
I feel like I just made a big mistake .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liz</ENAMEX> I ca n't tell you whether you did or not .
It just feels lousy .
And I just tried for the longest time to figure out what to do .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liz</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liz</ENAMEX> , I do n't know whether you made a mistake or not .
I ca n't possibly tell .
And I and I d- I do n't even have enough information to say whether you did or not .
And you will find out .
And if it 's a b- huge mistake you 'll just quit ,
that 's all .
You have no way of knowing .
Did you tell the public health people that you definitely do n't want that job ?
No
I did n't tell them anything .
oh okay .
Is that e- is that really such an awful job ?
Sounded to me like a lot of interesting things .
Sounded to me like too much
but it sounded like a very interesting set of things .
Is that something you definitely d- would not want to do ?
You had said that was an eas- I You had said you had said that was an easier job in some ways .
What ?
Actually I do n't think so anymore because I think that it 's too many things .
Are y- are you going to have to for either one of them are you going to have to spend hours preparing outside of the hours that you actually get paid for ?
I I do n't know yet .
Because I do n't think that that would be warranted -- -- at at at the salary that they 're giving you .
I I think that you ought to be able to circumscribe your hours very carefully .
I just got this call yesterday from this
I mean I j-
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liz</ENAMEX>
it was on a message on my machine when I came home from this nurse at a high school nearby saying I should call her about openings in the district that she called me because of one of the letters I wrote to one of the principals oh yeah ? who knows what kinds of openings there are .
mhm .
mhm .
So may-
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lizzy</ENAMEX> I know how up in the a-
you know when I was in graduate school I I spent a lot of time in my last year of c- college thinking about whether w- wanted to go into biophysics or wanted to teach little kids .
And I I knew it was obviously because what I really wanted to do was go into biophysics but also have my own little kids .
But I went into biophysics .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</ENAMEX> I 'd met Daddy
and I decided that was going to be it .
I really wanted to i- I really
Daddy was really going to be the one .
I got very unhappy with the science .
and I just walked out of one lab
and I said no this is it .
I just do n't want it .
I wanted to be teaching little kids .
Because Daddy was at that point noncommittal to say the least .
And %um and he was also leaving for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syracuse</ENAMEX> .
And so a friend of mine sat down with me , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wayne Meyers</ENAMEX>
and he said he was a very bright guy .
He was the one I cried whose shoulder I cried on when I took <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dexadrin</ENAMEX> that time too for
the doctor had given it to me for cramps
and I ended up getting %um depressed for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty - four hours</ENAMEX> .
%um and he said to me you really want to change .
I said yeah I really want to go .
He says well take the bus across the river this afternoon because I had already applied and been accepted to the
I mean it went so far that I w- I applied both to biophysics and to %um <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvard School of Ed</ENAMEX> .
And I did n't apply to any other ed schools because I figured I could get in in there which I had .
And I went across the river that day
and I said can I get into your <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> 's class .
And they said absolutely .
And I mean by then it was like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May</ENAMEX> .
Certainly <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April</ENAMEX> .
Certainly <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April</ENAMEX> not not not earlier .
And I remember Mama <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sadie</ENAMEX> was upset about it .
But everybody knew why I was doing it
and everybody kn-
e- it was obvious even to Daddy why I I just had to I had to do that for a while .
I could n't just study science for a while .
And I was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty - two</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty - one</ENAMEX> .
And and %um yeah I guess I was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty - two</ENAMEX> already .
%um and %um a- and and a- a- it 's it 's not any rational kind of thing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liz</ENAMEX> .
It 's hormonal .
It 's absolutely hormonal .
I mean here you are ,
you are thirty .
And it 's no wonder it 's no wonder that that that you do n't know what you want to do .
I did n't know what I wanted to do at that stage .
Well I did
but it was out of reach .
And for you it 's obviously out of reach too .
Unless it works out with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt</ENAMEX> you have n't met him .
And therefore I 'm I 'm I I I I 'm disappointed in how you 're going about it because I do n't see I do n't see I mean I I I I I 've I 've known so many people who did n't get married and so many people who got married too late to have children .
It 's very sad .
I find it very sad .
I did n't expect that I would be in this position with my children .
Well actually I expected it with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan</ENAMEX> .
I expected to worry about him not you because he was very slow socially .
And and and you know you never can tell with life .
There are n't any rules about it
and %uh th- nobody has nobody has written the future .
And it 's not really it 's it 's %uh %eh prayer
and %uh %eh penitence does n't really help .
It 's going to happen ,
things are going to happen when it happen they happen .
But you have to there there are ways to help them along .
There are ways to help them along .
And maybe you 're doing them
but I do n't see it .
I know you went out with some guy the other night .
May- maybe you are looking actively
but I I do n't see it .
So all I can do is sit and worry and be concerned
and I do n't think that you would Can we talk about the job things now ? that
Well what about the job things ?
I I ca n't talk about them .
I do n't know anything about them .
You want to tell me about them ?
Well you do n't like the job I just took .
Now wait a moment .
Do n't
Well Daddy says they 're less important than the other stuff
and I agree .
But do n't tell me I do n't like the job you just took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lizzy</ENAMEX> .
I do n't know enough about it .
You know I raised you
and I I thought I was
So maybe I can sign ten hours in the school district doing something else .
Maybe you can .
%eh it 's it 's that would be that would be interesting if you know you have hours during the week that are available .
Do n't do n't do n't block them out until you find out whether or not you can take a a an art course during the week . so that you can have your
I mean I you know I 'd like to see you flying down to %um where was it that they had that hiking group <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> for the for the weekends .
mhm
I want to fly out to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> and visit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt</ENAMEX> .
That 's where I want to fly .
%uh I 'd like to see you do that too .
All I want is your happiness <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liz</ENAMEX> .
And I think I know what will make you happy .
Well I just want to figure out what I want to do with my life .
You know I feel like I 'm never going to figure it out .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lizzy</ENAMEX> , you might not .
I have n't figured out mine yet .
You 're a scientist .
I 'm a scientist .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liz</ENAMEX> , that 's a pretty poor showing for a scientist .
Ma , are you kidding ?
Look how many days you go into the lab .
I know .
Look what I 've published .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> paper .
So who cares about publishing .
Well that 's what
otherwise , otherwise , I I 'm I 'm cooking
and nobody 's eating it .
It 's it 's recycling
it 's it 's work- working that nobody nobody ever knows about .
That 's not what defines me as a person .
What defines me as a person is is is my family .
And your failure daughter .
That 's what I 'm feeling sad about at the moment .
I just I 'm not going to be able to figure out what I want to do .
I just did n't know .
I thought this might be interesting okay .
And and maybe
That 's fine .
I do n't
that 's not my big that 's not my big worry about you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liz</ENAMEX> .
But it it 's it 's mine .
And I feel like I did n't know what to do
and then I feel like I took it
and now I feel like it 's a mistake
and now I
Well I 'm I 'm telling you
I 'm telling you it 's hormonal .
It 's not rational .
what to do .
You do n't just all of a su-
the heavens do n't open up as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gib</ENAMEX> wrote
and and all of a sudden you know just what you 're going to do .
If you define yourself that way -- -- you 're you 're you 're you 're you 're you 're looking for trouble .
But I just feel like I 'm -- You 're opening yoursel- -- **putty - duddying** around for the rest of my life .
And I do n't even have like I do n't have any specific skills or body of knowledge .
I 'm just sort of this blob .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lizzy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lizzy</ENAMEX> the mo-
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lizzy</ENAMEX> Daddy feels that way too .
He feels he does n't know anything .
Everybody feels that way .
You just have to get used to that .
You want to count your degrees ?
You want to count the courses you 've had ?
You want to count the work you 've done the jobs you 've had ?
That 's nonsense .
I do n't know .
Like maybe if I were a teacher then I would Everybody always you know and I taught say health , science and art , then I would sort of get this body of knowledge that I would have and this -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lizzy</ENAMEX> -- structure to it .
And then I yeah , yeah . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lizzy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lizzy</ENAMEX> give it
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lizzy</ENAMEX> , that 's a dream .
It never happens .
And I can tell you people at all levels
The only people who really think they know something are the people who usually are deficient .
When you do n't know know how mu-
But there 's people who have a specific set of skills .
I do n't even feel like I have that sometimes , you know .
It 's a-
what they have to offer .
I do n't have anything to offer .
yeah
becau- we- we- we- because you because you ca n't %um
%eh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lizzy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lizzy</ENAMEX> everybody feels that way who 's worth his salt .
Do you know that ?
Is what ?
