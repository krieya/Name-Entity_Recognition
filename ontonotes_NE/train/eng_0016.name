Here 's a classic Rumsfeldism -LSB- 1 -RSB- :
`` We do have a saying in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> :
if you 're in a hole , stop digging ...
erm , I 'm not sure I should have said that . ''
In Part <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> of his historical excavation of the life and world of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> -LRB- not to speak of the worlds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">both President Bushes</ENAMEX> , the neocons , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> military , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> , and an indolent media -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Morris</ENAMEX> , already deep in that hole , just keeps digging away .
In doing so , he offers us the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's long march to power , his lasting legacies , and the costly lessons of this comeback kid .
So much that went unheeded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> once again scaled the heights of power is now , thanks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris</ENAMEX> , compactly on the record .
`` The absence of evidence is not necessarily the evidence of absence '' is another infamous Rumsfeldism .
How true .
And in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's absence , the evidence of how he changed our world for the worse will be with us to consider for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> to come .
So , if you missed it , check out `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sharp Elbows</ENAMEX> , '' -LSB- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> -RSB- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> part of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Undertaker 's Tally</ENAMEX> , '' and then settle in for the sequel , the one you thought you knew until you read `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Power and the Glory</ENAMEX> .

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Power and the Glory : The Undertaker 's Tally</ENAMEX> -LRB- Part <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> -RRB-
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Morris</ENAMEX>
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Carter</ENAMEX> took the Presidency from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Ford</ENAMEX> , outgoing Defense Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> went off to seek corporate wealth as head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">G.D. Searle</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Skokie</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical company .
His period running the business , inherited by the family of his <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">North Shore</ENAMEX> friend and early backer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Searle</ENAMEX> , would become part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's legend of success as a master manager , negligently accepted as fact by the media and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Congressional</ENAMEX> representatives at his <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</ENAMEX> confirmation hearings .
The legend went this way :
Political prodigy slashes payroll <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> , turns decrepit loser into mega-profit - maker , earns industry kudos and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">multiple millions</ENAMEX> .
In looking at men of prominence like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> who revolve in and out of the private sector , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> media almost invariably adopts the press - release or booster business - page version of events from what inside - the - <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Beltway</ENAMEX> types call `` the real world . ''
In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's case , behind the image of corporate savior lay a far more relevant and ominous history .
In the documented version of reality , derived from litigation and relatively obscure investigations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and abroad , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Searle</ENAMEX> turned out to enjoy its notable rise less thanks to Rumsfeldian innovative managerial genius than to old - fashioned reckless marketing of pharmaceuticals already on the shelf and the calling in of lobbying `` markers '' via its well - connected <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> CEO .
And over it all wafted the distinctive odor of corrupt practices .
A case in point was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Searle</ENAMEX> 's anti-diarrhea medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lomotil</ENAMEX> , sold ever more widely and profitably internationally -LRB- in industry terms `` dumped '' -RRB- -- especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</ENAMEX> -- despite the company 's failure to warn of its potentially dire effects on younger children .
`` A blindly harmful stopcock , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> medical journal called the remedy , which could be poisonous to infants only slightly above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Searle</ENAMEX> 's recommended dosage .
Even taken according to directions , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lomotil</ENAMEX> was known to mask dangerous dehydration and cause a lethal build - up of fluids internally .
Having advertised the medicine as `` ideal for every situation , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Searle</ENAMEX> did not undertake a cautionary labeling change until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 1981</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly five years</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's tenure , and then only when threatened with damaging publicity by children 's advocacy groups .
Part of the vast outrage of multinational `` pharmas '' exploiting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Third World</ENAMEX> , the company under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> would , like the more publicized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Upjohn</ENAMEX> with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Depo - Provera</ENAMEX> , be implicated in widespread bribery of officials -LRB- and others -RRB- in poorer countries to promote the sale of oral contraceptives which had been found unsafe for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> women .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Searle</ENAMEX> 's magic potion , concocted well before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's arrival , was to be the controversial artificial sweetener aspertame , marketed under the trade name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NutraSweet</ENAMEX> .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FDA</ENAMEX> -RRB- had staunchly refused to approve aspertame for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">some 16 years</ENAMEX> , finding test data dubious or inconclusive and fearing that potential long - term dangers might prove prohibitive .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> took over in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Skokie</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FDA</ENAMEX> was taking the rare step of recommending to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justice Department</ENAMEX> prosecutors that a grand jury investigate the company 's applications for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FDA</ENAMEX> approval for `` willful and knowing failure to make reports . concealing material facts and making false statements '' in connection with the statutory application process required by law and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FDA</ENAMEX> standards .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next four years</ENAMEX> , federal regulators held firm against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Searle</ENAMEX> 's heavily financed campaigns .
Only with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> 's election in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> did fix and favor supplant science and the public interest .
Having campaigned for the new president and been named to his transition team , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> told his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Searle</ENAMEX> sales force , according to later testimony , that `` he would call in all his markers and that no matter what , he would see to it that aspartame would be approved . ''
The sequel would be a classic of the genre :
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Searle</ENAMEX> 's reapplication to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FDA</ENAMEX> the day <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> was inaugurated ; the prompt appointment of an agreeable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FDA</ENAMEX> commissioner who would later go to work for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Searle</ENAMEX> 's public relations firm for $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> a day ; further questionable , company - commissioned tests with more doubts by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FDA</ENAMEX> scientists but approval of aspertame nonetheless ; a later plague of health problems but by then vast profits throughout the corporate food economy followed by lavish , multi-company contributions to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Congressional</ENAMEX> committee members to stifle any outcry ; eventually , a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</ENAMEX> class - action suit alleging racketeering , fraud , and multiple abuses centering on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> , who meanwhile had become gloriously rich from aspertame and the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.7 - billion</ENAMEX> sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Searle</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Monsanto</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> .
In his return to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</ENAMEX> , he would go duly unscathed by any of the company 's history .
By the time litigation would be filed , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> was already <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months</ENAMEX> into the occupation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
Envoy
As it was , despite his business conquests , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> missed an even greater prize .
He had been on a short list to become <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan 's</ENAMEX> running mate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> presidential campaign when the candidate unexpectedly reached for his defeated primary rival -LRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> nemesis -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George H.W. Bush</ENAMEX> .
While , over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 12 years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> went on to the vice - presidency and presidency , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Baker</ENAMEX> -- equally detested by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> -- went along with his patron to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> staff and cabinet power , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> would build his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Searle</ENAMEX> fortune and bide his time .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> exception to his involuntary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> - era exile from government would be a stint in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</ENAMEX> as special presidential envoy to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> .
He would be sent to arrange <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> support for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> in its war with the hated <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ayatollah Khomeini</ENAMEX> , a role little noticed at the time which nonetheless produced the notorious photo of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> shaking hands with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> dictator .
The deeper story was far more embarrassing than any simple handshake .
Most of the relevant records on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several - month</ENAMEX> assignment are still classified , though it is clear that , as at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Office of Equal Opportunity</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">OEO</ENAMEX> -RRB- , he took on his mission with a passion .
He worked to shower on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> -LRB- in a manner as unnoticed as possible -RRB- an infamous flow of intelligence , financial credits , and sensitive materials and technology that would come to underpin <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> chemical and bacteriological warfare programs , leading to hideous gas attacks on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shia</ENAMEX> dissidents and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kurds</ENAMEX> as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> forces .
In general , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> put his shoulder to the wheel to shore up the war - worn <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Baathist</ENAMEX> regime that had attacked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> .
In this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1980s</ENAMEX> de facto alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> , as in much else , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> was never alone .
Their gambit was , in turn , backed by Senators and Congressmen in both parties who were briefed on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's mission and obligingly shunned oversight of the manifold aspects of the sometimes illegal collusion with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> .
Their dereliction was assured , in part , by the general animus toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">a Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> then effectively controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> , and increasingly under the bipartisan influence of the growing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> lobby and its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel Aviv</ENAMEX> handlers .
The lobby quietly , cynically pushed both for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and for covert arms - dealing with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> -LRB- later exposed in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Iran - Contra scandal</ENAMEX> -RRB- , viewing the ongoing no - winners carnage of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> states as a boon .
All this went on largely unreported , given the customary media diffidence or indolence on national security issues .
Historically , the moral outrage and far - reaching political folly of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington</ENAMEX> 's furtive arming of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> tyranny to bleed another , with untold casualties on each side -LRB- including the murderous suppression of would - be democrats in both countries -RRB- , would belong at the doorstep of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> 's reactionary regime and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington</ENAMEX> foreign - policy establishment as a whole .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's role was instrumental and in some respects crucial , but only part of the larger disgrace .
At the same time , in the intelligence briefings he received as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> official to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Baghdad Pact</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1950s</ENAMEX> , he would have been uniquely aware , as no other senior figure in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington</ENAMEX> , of the brutal character of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein 's</ENAMEX> regime and , in particular , the sectarian , regional , tribal , and clan politics that lay behind it .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Ba'athists</ENAMEX> were a government , after all , that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> itself had helped to recruit and install in the coup of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</ENAMEX> , reinstalled in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Agency</ENAMEX> 's original clients lost control , and then watched closely while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> had a flirtation -LRB- involving an arms - supply relationship -RRB- with the feared <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> -LRB- whose influence the bloody <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</ENAMEX> coup was supposed to counter -RRB- .
This was particularly true in the aftermath of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Arab - Israeli War of 1973</ENAMEX> with its peace agreements from which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> emerged as a principal remaining challenge to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</ENAMEX> , the volatile , complex currents of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> 's political culture , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> 's essentially family and clan rule , and the now crude , now subtle layering of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunni</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shia</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Ba'athist</ENAMEX> bureaucracy and plutocracy , as well as the wartime distrust and savage repression of a suspect , subordinate <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shia</ENAMEX> majority , were well known to outside intelligence agencies as well as scholars and journalists .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DIA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State Department Bureaus of Near Eastern Affairs and Intelligence and Research</ENAMEX> -- and certainly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> as presidential envoy -- also had reason to understand much about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> 's grandiose ambition , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> 's old rivalry with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> , to lead a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="3">pan-Arab</ENAMEX> nationalist renaissance to some kind of future parity with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's nuclear - armed military might .
In addition to the usual extensive intelligence - sharing with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mossad</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">less than two years</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> operatives had literally lit the way for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israeli</ENAMEX> F fighter bombers in their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1981</ENAMEX> surprise attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> 's fledgling nuclear reactor at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osiraq</ENAMEX> .
They planted guidance transmitters along the low - level flight path under <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jordanian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> radar to the point of painting the target with lasers .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Agency</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mossad</ENAMEX> then watched as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> dauntlessly , defiantly began to rebuild and expand their nuclear program .
From some <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</ENAMEX> scientists and technicians with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million</ENAMEX> in funding , that program would grow to perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,000</ENAMEX> scientists and technicians with as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</ENAMEX> at their command , some of which was indirectly made possible by the bounty <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> carried to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1980s</ENAMEX>
For anyone dealing seriously with these issues , there could have been little doubt that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> would use the considerable aid and trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> was sliding his way under the table to mount a better - armed , more bloody war on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> , to further the regime 's most ambitious dreams of weapons development , and to tyrannize all the more savagely potentially rebellious <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiites</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kurds</ENAMEX> .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington</ENAMEX> watched , he did all of that --
and no one could have been less surprised than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> himself .
Long afterward , as some of the ugly essence of his mission to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> dribbled out amid the ruins of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> occupation , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> would be faulted for pandering to , and appeasing , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> -LRB- whose gassing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kurds</ENAMEX> had already begun -RRB- -- in the wake of a single , timorous , hypocritical statement issued in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1984</ENAMEX> criticizing his use of chemical weapons .
The actual toll of the policy to which he was integral would prove so much higher as time passed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> chemical weapons plants bombed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX> released agents to which some <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> troops were exposed .
The infamous <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War Syndrome</ENAMEX> might evend be traced in some measure to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> credits , materiel , and technology <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> knowingly conveyed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years before</ENAMEX> .
So , too , of course , could <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> 's brutal <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980s</ENAMEX> repression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shia</ENAMEX> , underlying the sectarian animus and resolve for vengeance and dominance by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> - installed <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shia</ENAMEX> regime after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</ENAMEX> that shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's , historic failure in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
Others colluded at every turn in the long scandal of policy toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colin Powell</ENAMEX> , then the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney</ENAMEX> , as Secretary of Defense during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the First Gulf War</ENAMEX> , would , for instance , be directly complicit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Syndrome</ENAMEX> outrage .
Yet none of the participants in the larger post <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">/ 11</ENAMEX> disaster was more directly responsible than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> .
While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> 's special envoy was , with his usual energy and sharp elbows , dickering with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1980s</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Condoleezza Rice</ENAMEX> was an assistant professor of no scholarly distinction at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Stanford</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> - term congressman from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX> squirming up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> leadership ladder ; future viceroy of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Paul `` Jerry '' Bremer</ENAMEX> moving from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State Department</ENAMEX> clerk and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Haig</ENAMEX> protege to lavish - party giving ambassador to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> , still by his own account given to `` heavy drinking , '' absorbed in changing the name of his chronically failed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Arbusto Energy</ENAMEX> oil company to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bush Exploration</ENAMEX> .
Waiting Game
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> was flexing his muscles once more , preparing for the ultimate goal , assembling money and party support for a presidential run against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George H. W. Bush</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> .
But after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a dozen years</ENAMEX> out of office , and against the entrenched power of an heir apparent , he would soon enough discover that backing just was not there .
Off more recent prominence and with a wider political base , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> would try to mount his own presidential campaign in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</ENAMEX> , only to meet the same bitter rejection
Historians will only guess at the rancor building in these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> deeply ambitious , deeply disappointed figures at the president they had , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> , whom they no doubt saw as manifestly , maddeningly inferior .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> recompense , at vast cost to the nation and world , would be their fierce seizure of power after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">September 11 , 2001</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> spent the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990s</ENAMEX> again in business , becoming CEO of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Instruments</ENAMEX> , then Chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gilead Sciences Pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX> , with another history reminiscent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Searle</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> , he joined the board of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABB</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Swedish</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Swiss</ENAMEX> conglomerate that had gobbled up companies in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the latter 1980s</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> energy operations , and would move aggressively to win a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 - million</ENAMEX> contract for `` the design and key components '' for light - water nuclear reactors in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> pursued this prize even while chairing a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Congressional</ENAMEX> commission on missile threats that found a `` clear danger '' for the future from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pyongyang</ENAMEX> .
In the alarming report , his otherwise fulsome resume failed to mention that he was an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABB</ENAMEX> director .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> , he took leave from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gilead</ENAMEX> to become chief foreign policy advisor , along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfowitz</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dole 's</ENAMEX> failed presidential run .
He would end as the campaign 's <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">eighteen - hour</ENAMEX> - a - day manager .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> , amid the full - scale takeover of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> by the long - churning cabal of neoconservatives , he joined <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfowitz</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingirch</ENAMEX> - instigated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congressional Policy Advisory Board</ENAMEX> to shape attacks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Clinton Administration</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1998</ENAMEX> , he signed the celebrated letter so publicly sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> from the right - wing , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> lobby - dominated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Project for a New American Century</ENAMEX> .
Alongside <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfowitz</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perle</ENAMEX> , and others soon to be key players in the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's regime , he vigorously urged the `` removal '' of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1998</ENAMEX> , there followed the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rumsfeld Commission</ENAMEX> '' report on missile threats , wildly claiming , in an unnamed debut of the `` axis of evil '' drawn from the testimony and staff work of right - wing ideologues , that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> would each be able to `` inflict major destruction '' on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</ENAMEX> .
Through it all , including the first <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven - and - a - half months</ENAMEX> of their rule after the seamy election of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</ENAMEX> , there would be no trace of the actual danger that erupted out of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> morning sky in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</ENAMEX> .
Though he had repaired surface relations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bushes</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> took no major role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</ENAMEX> race .
In any case , the elder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> had erased him from his son 's list of possible running mates , while ultimately waving through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> , whose reactionary animus had been relatively well masked at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pentagon</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> .
When , post-election , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> vetoed Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Ridge</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> , and there were throbbing neocon fears that a cosmetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> , bureaucrat at heart , would be far too equivocal at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Department</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> would be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> 's , and so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's , antidote .
His appointment was a mark of the extreme poverty of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> talent the administration reflected so graphically .
The supposed party of national security , having held <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the White House</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> of the last <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> terms and dominated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> for much of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous 30 years</ENAMEX> , had no serious alternative to a man who had perched atop the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> a full <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter - century</ENAMEX> before .
Apart from the patently right - wing , widely discredited missile panel he had chaired , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> had shown no palpable interest or competence in the ever more complex defense issues accumulating since then , much less the rapidly changing politics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT" S_OFF="5">post-Cold War</ENAMEX> world . Nonetheless , fit , relatively youthful at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">69</ENAMEX> , he strode again into the E-Ring .
There was speculation that the old <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Halloween Massacre</ENAMEX> goal was still there , that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> , with his uncertain health , might step aside in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</ENAMEX> , that the undertaker might yet reach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Oval Office</ENAMEX> .
Mastery
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> began his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> reprise by seizing on a dead <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> marshal and an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">octogenarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington</ENAMEX> bureaucrat few had ever heard of .
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama bin Laden</ENAMEX> , steely - haired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikolai Ogarkov</ENAMEX> first came to light during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</ENAMEX> , at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50</ENAMEX> , he had become a prodigal chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Staff</ENAMEX> .
In that superannuated , medal - mummified company , he proved a dynamic , technically inclined , forward - thinking young general .
Over the ensuing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> , he would be an impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moscow</ENAMEX> spokesman on arms control , and defend stubbornly , even abjectly , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</ENAMEX> shooting down of a civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Korean Airlines</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">747</ENAMEX> that had veered into <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> air space .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ogarkov</ENAMEX> would fall from power in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kremlin</ENAMEX> struggle over weapons spending , write a valedictory book warning of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> militarism , and die in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="5">post-Soviet</ENAMEX> obscurity in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</ENAMEX> .
But his main , if esoteric , historical distinction would lie in a slight <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> pamphlet in which he blamed the early , nearly lethal <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> defeats in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> on a failure to adapt to the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> blitzkrieg concepts in tank warfare .
Recent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> advances in weapons technology , he argued , could leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> similarly vulnerable if they did n't adapt quickly enough .
Sweeping changes in tactics and arms as well as more agile , responsive armed forces were needed to face the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> challenge , the Marshal advised .
Otherwise , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> forces would fall into a series of devastating traps on a future remote - targeted battlefield in which the enemy would utilize the latest computerized surveillance and information systems in a new form of high - tech warfare .
His vision soon gained vogue as much in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> as amid the stultified upper reaches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> military of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</ENAMEX> .
It was grandly christened -- and welcomed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> aficionados -- as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the `` Revolution in Military Affairs</ENAMEX> '' or , in that acronym - laden world , <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RMA</ENAMEX> .
There was a certain banality to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ogarkov</ENAMEX> 's stress on technology .
That a fighting force should be best attuned to the battlefield and adversary of the moment -- modern , adaptable , quick , and informed -- should have been self - evident , on the order of the bloody lesson <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">80 years</ENAMEX> before of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Tsarist</ENAMEX> cavalry charging entrenched machine guns in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Russo - Japanese War</ENAMEX> .
Yet however obvious the premise , the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RMA</ENAMEX> concept -- transported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and put in the context of an onrushing generation of electronic warfare , of near - nuclear effects with non-nuclear means , along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ogarkov</ENAMEX> 's call for fresh tactics -LRB- and thus new weaponry and higher spending -RRB- -- was taken up by innovators , opportunists , and their assorted hybrids on both sides of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Cold War</ENAMEX> .
This was particularly so among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> , whose rusty <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> - heavy military was already being shaken and bled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> by the Mujahideen -- in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> , despite ample <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> money , still only partially armed by their cynical <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">CIA</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Pakistani</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> handlers .
At any rate , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ogarkov</ENAMEX> 's truism was also grist for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> 's back - ring band of civilian military `` theorists , '' career bureaucrats ever in search of a mission and occupationally disposed to attribute evil genius -- requiring a suitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington</ENAMEX> budgetary response -- to the Red Menace .
Short , bald , and with stylishly severe wire - rimmed glasses , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Marshall</ENAMEX> was a Dickensian clerk of a man who took up the bureaucratic cudgel <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RMA</ENAMEX> represented and brought it down inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> .
An economist by training , he had begun at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RAND</ENAMEX> as an analyst in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1940s</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> was still in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Trier High School</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> was archetypical in the career - making fear and folly of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> mirror - image rivalry .
He had been a protege of think - the - unthinkable , <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War III</ENAMEX> theorist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman Kahn</ENAMEX> , and then , via <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kissinger 's</ENAMEX> mentor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fritz Kraemer</ENAMEX> , had gone to work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Security Council</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NSC</ENAMEX> -RRB- in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> term .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</ENAMEX> , he moved on to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> where he presided over his own obscure nest , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Office of Net Assessment</ENAMEX> , from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">I</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">II</ENAMEX> , while gradually gaining the reputation of resident genius of new war methods .
Discreet guru to reactionaries , ignored but thought untouchable by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> when in power , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> looked on as the Joint Chiefs not only spied on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX> 's arms control negotiations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> , but also played an ardent supporting role in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> 's fall .
He subsequently signed on to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">I</ENAMEX> 's denial of defeat in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam</ENAMEX> and then , on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RMA</ENAMEX> 's advent , used the concept to evoke ominous fears of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kremlin</ENAMEX> military prowess , justifying the orgy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> spending that took place during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> era .
-LRB- Ironically , of course , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ogarkov</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> was arguing for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> response to a still largely prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> escalation of weaponry and warfare . -RRB-
While the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> armaments spree of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980s</ENAMEX> paid for some new <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RMA</ENAMEX> developments , most of the expenditures fit snugly within the corrupt , obtuse old <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> system , with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's armed forces tailored to a lumbering <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> threat in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , and no serious anticipation of the neo-insurgency wars that actually lay ahead .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> toyed with `` flexibility '' -- and the Joint Chiefs cherry - picked his conjuring of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Moscow</ENAMEX> 's might for their own budgetary purposes , while ignoring the real import , and limits , of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RMA</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Cold War</ENAMEX> ended in the equivocations and evasions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> terms in office and the low - rent , self - congratulatory installing of mafia regimes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> .
The gnome - like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> , well past retirement but a lionized witness before the missile - threat commission , hung on for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's return .
The resulting history is far too close for much documented detail , though its silhouette is plain enough .
Summoning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> as soothsayer , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> made <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RMA</ENAMEX> the logo of his determination to gain managerial dominance over the Joint Chiefs and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> bureaucracy , exactly the opportunity he thought he had missed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years</ENAMEX> earlier .
Under the old banner of a clash between a brave , beleaguered secretary of defense and the recalcitrant brass astride an impossible , `` glandular '' system , he held up the all - purpose , all - seasons ideal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> `` reform . ''
That `` reform '' movement was to be his ultimate takedown , his claim to greatness , and perhaps -- who knew in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> last shot at the presidency .
Amid the inevitable claims of `` streamlining '' and `` modernizing , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> applauded and reporters gushed reflexively about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> as a celebrity CEO and national quipster .
The willing ignorance , denial , careless trust , or craven acquiescence that marked the essential submissiveness of the political and media culture to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's rule were only part of a larger , thoughtless national abdication of judgment and responsibility in the wars he would propel in both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
In blindly striking out after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">9 / 11</ENAMEX> -- a reflexive , grandly opportunistic , richly self - satisfying political act in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> -- without seriously understanding the politics or history of either country , he plunged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> into blundering , plundering occupations that made the nightmares of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2007</ENAMEX> and beyond nearly inevitable .
That was the price -- in the utter absence of serious dialogue in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</ENAMEX> election or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first eight months of 2001</ENAMEX> -- of the original uncontested surrender of foreign - policy power and initiative to such evident presidential incompetence -LRB- including the shocking ineptitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NSC</ENAMEX> Advisor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Condoleezza Rice</ENAMEX> and her staff -RRB- and the long predictable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> dominance .
All of it was plain in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> soon after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush 's</ENAMEX> arrival in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Oval Office</ENAMEX> ; none of it was then questioned , much less challenged , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> , the remnant foreign policy establishment , or the mainstream media .
No democratic process so completely failed a test of substance as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">9 / 11</ENAMEX> .
No ensuing catastrophe was more consensual .
History will unravel only slowly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's relationship to the neocons , who dominated the middle and upper reaches of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> , a relationship more complex than contemporary hagiographies or demonologies have had it .
Historically , he was their ally , patron , legitimizing figurehead , but never really of them , never a fellow ideologue , dogmatist , or slavish adherent to much of what they pursued .
In enlisting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfowitz</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perle</ENAMEX> and their train , he would use them , much as he used <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> , as he had used so many before , as a means to what was so largely a personal , megalomaniacal end .
But that use , too , was characteristically heedless of substance and cost .
He opened government as never before to men who habitually , automatically assumed that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> interests were identical , with no objectivity about <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> policy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">a Middle East</ENAMEX> they scarcely understood to begin with .
Their ignorance and presumption were matched only by their zeal to cluster in decisive quarters of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> regime where decisions of grand strategy , of war and peace , were now shaped and predetermined .
`` Like cancer cells , '' as eyewitness , Lieutenant Colonel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Kwiakowski</ENAMEX> , would describe them in action in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Defense Department</ENAMEX> .
Half - educated and fanatically loyal to the rote <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> lobby view of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> and the larger neocon craze for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT" S_OFF="5">post-Cold War</ENAMEX> global hegemony , they crowded the domains of the number <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> official at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> , Undersecretary of Defense for Policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Feith</ENAMEX> , whose career was a model of their kind and whose notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Office of Special Plans</ENAMEX> was created as a fount for the fraudulent intelligence spurring the invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
Historians will debate , too , the obvious blurred allegiance of what some call these <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Likudniks</ENAMEX> '' with their utter conformity to the belligerent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="6">ultra-Zionist</ENAMEX> mentality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> right .
Never before -- not even in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT" S_OFF="5">post-World War II</ENAMEX> heyday of the powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> Lobby with its formidable grip on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> but not within the upper reaches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Executive</ENAMEX> itself -- had so many of such uncritical adherence to the policies of a foreign power been so well placed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington</ENAMEX> .
As often in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> politics and government , however , no conspiracies were necessary , though a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> lobby spy scandal has yet to be played out .
Unrelieved substantive shallowness , a perversely narrow sociology of knowledge , long - jockeyed - for power and career advancement , a grandiose parochial vision of a Pax <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americana</ENAMEX> world nursed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</ENAMEX> forgotten think - tank papers and incestuous conferences -- all that as well imposed a stifling , disastrous orthodoxy on the administration .
Not least , they operated without the need to support their prejudices or delusions in authentic high - level debate , flourishing in their members - only domains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NSC</ENAMEX> Staff , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Department</ENAMEX> , enjoying exclusive channels of communication to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> , and unchallenged under a President of uniquely closed mind .
As for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's relations with his generals , the subject of veiled accusations of his heedlessness to dissent or running roughshod over warnings of serious problems , we actually know very little .
The calamity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> has brought more public criticism by senior officers than any other war in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> history , including <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam</ENAMEX> , but almost all of it hurled from the relatively safe seats of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL" E_OFF="5">three-star</ENAMEX> retirement -- and forlornly after the fact .
This much is clear :
No major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> leaks , the time - honored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington</ENAMEX> weapon of dissenting commanders , marked the run - up to the invasion .
There have been no public resignations in protest of his policies .
And the negligence , incompetence , and inertia of commanders in recognizing and coping with the insurgency , in dealing with scandals of prisoner abuse , inadequate equipment and more , have been all too obvious .
There is no evidence that any ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> officer on duty pressed an intellectual or moral challenge to the unfolding debacle -- even after it was too glaring to be ignored .
As in so much else in his long record , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> enjoyed , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington</ENAMEX> 's inimitable mix of careerism and cowardice , submission and opportunism , a large supporting cast in his folly .
Takedown
In the exhilarating dash to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</ENAMEX> , none of the admiring gallery seemed to notice that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's `` new '' military was largely the old one , `` reformed '' in name only ; nor did many note that the vaunted lean , mean machine of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RMA</ENAMEX> and the again - lionized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> had no grasp of how profoundly political was the act of overthrowing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Ba</ENAMEX> rule ; how deeply political was the campaign to which so many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> lives , so much of the country 's material and symbolic national treasures , would be committed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> would take his victory tour in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Gulf</ENAMEX> that spring as if circling the mat after a stunningly swift pin .
What was his toughest call , trailing reporters asked -- part of the traditional garlands of victory tossed his way -- and how did he `` feel '' at such a victorious moment ?
It was hardly the time for the media , the seemingly omnipotent military , or the rest of government and the political culture to reflect on how much `` shock and awe '' depended on overwhelming force brought down on the near - defenseless , on how much the concept reeked of racism and colonial pretense - of natives on the scene and in the vicinity `` shocked and awed '' like <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Zulus</ENAMEX> pounded and panicked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen</ENAMEX> 's own latest howitzers .
It was far too early for other questions -- about a force cosseted at the end of vulnerable supply lines , nicely photogenic in night goggles but without enough body armor ; about acronyms like IED that had yet to enter the vocabularies of either commanders or reporters ; about the familiar chase for medals and the absence of an enemy admitting defeat and ready to surrender -LRB- a missing essential of `` victory '' that would have much worried <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell Taylor</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Unreformed , uninformed commanders , uninstructed beyond brief battles , led their charges into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> relying on their generals .
The generals relied on civilians .
The civilians relied on -LRB- or were seduced or bullied by -RRB- the neocons .
The neocons relied on their own ersatz expertise , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mossad</ENAMEX> insiders , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> exiles long out of touch with their homeland .
The exiles -- holed up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> palaces with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> - paid - for mercenary guards , ignorant and contemptuous of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> that had passed them by , and where they were now powerless , even with the might of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> behind them -- relied on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> , as always , relied on himself .
The ranks trusted him -- and political decision - makers -- to know and manage post-Saddam politics in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> to secure the victory as well as to provide the political setting that fulfilled the military triumph .
When they failed miserably , condemning the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> force to a corrupt , untenable occupation and slow - wasting attrition of men and prestige , the debacle was complete .
Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Iraq</ENAMEX> were his other lasting legacies .
As no other cabinet officer in history , he turned over crucial , self - sustaining functions of his department to privateers and private armies .
He surrendered vital supply and commissariat services for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> military to profit - plundering contractors for whom <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> forces were neither fellow warriors , nor even share - holders , but captive `` customers '' to be treated with the offhandedness afforded by guaranteed contracts .
He ceded security and combat functions essential to the national mission to a corps of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of hired guns whose qualifications , standards of conduct and ultimate loyalty -- all integral to the safety and success of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> forces -- were beyond effective governmental control or measure .
-LRB- Exposed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Congressional</ENAMEX> hearing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February 7</ENAMEX> , the scandal of the infamous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blackwell Security Corporation</ENAMEX> , shirking amid vast profit the arming and protection of its own ranks , would be only a glimpse of the larger disgrace . -RRB-
Not since the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> hired hordes of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hessians</ENAMEX> to crush <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Washington 's</ENAMEX> revolutionary army had a military force tracing to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> been so utterly mercenary .
The potential direct and indirect levy on policy and the armed forces would not be known for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> .
As no other cabinet officer in history , he squandered the integrity of his department and the unique , indispensable code of honor of its services .
He joined , and often led , the rest of an intellectually degraded administration , heedless of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW" E_OFF="2">Constitutional</ENAMEX> and human rights , in violating the very heart of their ostensibly conservative convictions .
With the ready sanctioning , and then de facto cover - up of torture and abuse at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Abu Ghraib</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Guantanamo</ENAMEX> , and the less noticed but equally gruesome prisons at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bagram Air Base</ENAMEX> and elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> , he changed , for untold <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</ENAMEX> , the symbol of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and its once - proud military from freedom and the rule of law to the unforgettable prisoner 's hood and shackles .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's impact would not vanish with terms of office or elections .
By the very nature of contracts , personnel practices , and imparted ethics -- some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington</ENAMEX> 's most permanent monuments -- his legacies would remain deep in the tissue and soul of the institution he was entrusted to lead .
At the end , a pathetic climax to his <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than four decades</ENAMEX> either in government or imploringly on its threshold , there was only his hackneyed memo on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> policy -- leaked , even more pathetically , in an apparent attempt somehow to vindicate him after all .
Thus , he growled that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> regime , like some seedy wrestling team , should `` pull up its socks '' ; and , most poignantly , ever the politician conducting lethal policy as politics , he advised that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington</ENAMEX> `` announce that whatever new approach the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> decides on , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> is doing so on a trial basis .
This will give us the ability to re-adjust and move to another course , if necessary , and therefore not ' lose . ' ''
As he left office for the last time , it would be only the loss that mattered .
As a pathologically unfit president struggled to recoup his historic blunder , as the neocons and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> lobby pressed on a gullible media and restive but still captive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> the myth of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> nuclear threat , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Air Force</ENAMEX> , lesser actors in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> action , promised wondrous results in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Persia</ENAMEX> , the chaos and ineffable danger were left to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Gates</ENAMEX> , the puffy courtier .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Weeks</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> 's departure , history -- the little ever really known or understood -- was already being waved off , forgotten .
The past was too complicated and troublesome , too guilt - ridden and close to home , too filled with chilling consequences .
The worst of it was the most basic and damning .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> and all he represented , all he did and did not do , came out of us .
The undertaker 's tally , including <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Iraq</ENAMEX> , was compiled at our leave , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> way or another , at every turn .
His tragedy was always ours .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Morris</ENAMEX> , who served in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Department</ENAMEX> and on the Senior Staff of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Security Council</ENAMEX> under Presidents <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> , resigned in protest at the invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambodia</ENAMEX> .
He then worked as a legislative advisor in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> and a director of policy studies at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Carnegie Endowment</ENAMEX> , and writes this Rumsfeldian history from intimate firsthand knowledge as well as extensive research .

More recently , he co-authored with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally Denton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Money and the Power</ENAMEX> -LSB- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</ENAMEX> -RSB- , a history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> as the paradigm of national corruption . His latest work , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Shadows of the Eagle</ENAMEX> , a history of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> covert interventions and policy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South Asia</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past half - century</ENAMEX> , will be published in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2007</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Knopf</ENAMEX> .
