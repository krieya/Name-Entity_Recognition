<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Stewart</ENAMEX> is n't the only corporate figurehead in the news <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
The jury has handed down a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Rapids</ENAMEX> jury saying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taco Bell</ENAMEX> has to pay the true creators of the Chihuahua mascot <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> men claimed their idea originated , and proved I am in the wrong business .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taco Bell</ENAMEX> is appealing .
Joining me is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Rinks</ENAMEX> with his attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Doza</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> , you 've got to be happy with the settlement .
I know they 're going to appeal , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> tell me how you came up with the Chihuahua character ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> and myself , he 's the partner , we were looking to design some licenses to put on some t - shirts , and at the time big dogs were big , and all the mean dogs , and no fear was a big hit , and we thought it was time for a bit of a change for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</ENAMEX> crowd .
So we actually took the opposite of all that , and looked for the smallest , weakest , most timid animal , and tried to make him cool , tried to make him big , and we knew if he gave him some spunk , everybody would root for him .
How did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taco Bell</ENAMEX> folks run into you ?
They actually came to us at a licensing show .
We had been licensing to a bunch of different manufacturers , and in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> we were at a show in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nick Loada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Universal Studios</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taco Bell</ENAMEX> walked up to us and said they were looking for a masscot for their brand and this would be perfect .
That started a year relationship we had with them .
And it went on for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</ENAMEX> , and you thought it did n't pan out and then you pick up a trade paper and read they 're going ahead with it ?
After we 'd finalized all the commercials , and actually done the campaign for them , they hired a new ad agency , and telephone calls just started staggering off .
Then they stopped coming , and we heard about the ads , and they were exactly what we had presented for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">over a year</ENAMEX> .
When you <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> heard that , or read that , did you just go ballistic ?
I mean , no offense , but it was you and one other guy who created this thing .
They 're a huge , huge corporation .
Yeah , it was devastating , to say the least , but we really did n't know --
