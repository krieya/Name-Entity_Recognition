So I work in that same beauty salon ,
I 'm chained to the old masquerade
The lipstick , the shadow , the silicone :
I follow my father 's trade -
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Cohen</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> may be another example of a celebrity distraction which , upon examination , reveals more about our society 's mortal condition than a tabloid could imagine .
Almost certainly more than it would dare to describe .
Yesterday , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> was ordered to close <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neverland</ENAMEX> for having failed to pay the ranch 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</ENAMEX> employees their salary or insurance since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 2005</ENAMEX> .
Unfortunate for the unpaid staff and the abandoned llamas but no surprise .
He 's moved on since his aquittal , like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Glitter</ENAMEX> did after his <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</ENAMEX> conviction , having departed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last June</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahrain</ENAMEX> `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
-LRB- '' For the people working at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahrain</ENAMEX> 's malls , the person covered head to toe in a black veil , gloves and glasses appeared to be a rich , doting <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> mother ....
But why would a woman wear a man 's shoes ?
Why the bodyguards ?
And why did the person 's fluid movements seem so familiar ? '' -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week 's</ENAMEX> real <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> story ran in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Daily News</ENAMEX> , under the snappy banner `` Creepy dad was root of all clan 's woe , singer sez . ''
The singer was brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jermaine</ENAMEX> , and the claims based on the projected outline for his abandoned `` tell - all '' family story .
Reading that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> was a nightmare of a father and sexually abusive towards his daughters is not exactly a `` stop the presses '' moment .
What 's new is this :
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jermaine</ENAMEX> even suggested his father may have set up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> to be somehow victimized by older men .
He tells how his father would have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> join in at late - night hotel room meetings with `` important business people , '' and wondered whether `` something happened '' to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> at those sessions .
He said he sensed something was wrong because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> would be sick for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">days</ENAMEX> after .
`` What was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> doing ? '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jermaine</ENAMEX> wrote .
This lifts the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> family horror show to a whole new order of dysfunction , one that sees parents network with power and trade their children for privilege .
This should be a motif familiar to anyone acquainted with the literature of mind control and ritual abuse survivors : the father and first controller , passing his child - victim up the social ladder of abuse in return for status , protection and reward .
All that 's missing is the element of occult terror .
Or maybe not : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LaToya</ENAMEX> also described being awakened in the night by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> wearing a ' monster mask . ' ''
Perhaps we can take more from this than the suspicion that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> clan had gotten with the program .
Perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre-existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect .
-LRB- This is how I tend to think of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponchatoula</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hosanna Church</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
Yet we should n't discount the suspicion , either , particularly given some of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> 's paranormal interests and peculiar associations .
His close friendship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SPECTRA</ENAMEX> contactee and channeller of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uri Geller</ENAMEX> , for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> instance .
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geller</ENAMEX> 's best man in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</ENAMEX> when he and his wife renewed his vows , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geller</ENAMEX> is said to have been reactivated as a psychic spy . -RRB-
His entourage including a `` personal magician '' for another .
Even if you wanted to , you wo n't be reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jermaine</ENAMEX> 's account now .
Like every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jackson</ENAMEX> sibling who 's tried to break from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> , he 's climbed down , returned to the fold and scrapped the book , apparently on the strength of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> 's threats to sue .
Previously , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> 's given cause for family observers to attribute his grotesque body dysmorphia to a dread of resembling his father .
Yet there they were at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> 's trial last year , hand in hand .
In the big picture <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> means not very much .
But his little picture may be more newsworthy than the news suggests .
good stuff .
having departed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last June</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahrain</ENAMEX> `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
Actually , there have been reports for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two days</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> .
#NAME ?
Wild wild stuff <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX> !
Disinformation Distraction Dis and Dat ..
The netwerk is as sacred to the state as their mantra `` My way or total annihilation . ''
Bait and switch sets the agenda .
There is no such thing as an accident .
It 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> morning , and the papers say a moon of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Saturn</ENAMEX> is spewing life - giving water .... then I see the new R.I. post is about the perrenial child <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> .
This day is named for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saturn</ENAMEX> ...
" ... it was foretold that one day a mighty son of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saturn</ENAMEX> would in turn overthrow him ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saturn</ENAMEX> devoured all of his children when they were born to prevent this ... ''
Apparently <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saturn</ENAMEX> is also intimately connected with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Masonics</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Revelation 13</ENAMEX> - you know , the `` number of the beast '' ...
Nevermind -
I need a cup of coffee ...
I looked in vain for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> `` A hunting we will go '' to post this out and paste but ...
And on the subject of cowardice , consider this . In a recent hunting escapade , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney</ENAMEX> accidentally shot <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of his hunting comrades .
There may have been negligence involved , but that is up to the local district attorney to decide .
But more importantly , I think , is the nature of the hunt .
These were not wild birds .
The birds were bred in captivity .
They had spent their lives in pens , and then on hunting day , were released for the sole purpose of being killed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney</ENAMEX> and cohorts for pure sport as they flew into the open sky for their only moments of brief freedom .
Whether you are an animal lover or not , there is something disgusting and degrading about this kind of hunt and something less than human about those who participate in it .
The link `` personal majician '' is intrigueing .
From <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madsen</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boucher</ENAMEX> :
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> 's stay at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cedars</ENAMEX> was arranged through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Kuo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush 's</ENAMEX> White House director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Office of Faith - based Initiatives</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuo</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> employee ... had been Executive Director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Center for Effective Compassion</ENAMEX> , founded in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arianna Huffington</ENAMEX> ...
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuo</ENAMEX> also previously worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Christian Coalition</ENAMEX> and Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ashcroft</ENAMEX> .

maybe later as the story develops ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boucher</ENAMEX> 's piece mentions how victims of sexual abuse often have childlike voices , almost as if their development was ' frozen ' around the time of their abuse .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> seems to be of this type .
Or more perversely , fakes that he is :
`` I was always saying -LSB- to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> -RSB- people would n't think I was so crazy if they saw who the hell you really are , that you sit around , and you drink and you curse and you 're -LSB- expletive -RSB- funny and you have a bad mouth , and you do n't have that high voice all the time '' -

Anonymous quoted , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> 's stay at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cedars</ENAMEX> was arranged through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Kuo</ENAMEX> ... ''
Hold on --
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cedars</ENAMEX> is the headquarters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Fellowship Foundation</ENAMEX> , the creepy <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christianoid</ENAMEX> cult with deep political connections .
Here 's a bit of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madsen</ENAMEX> article that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> quote comes from :
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fellowship</ENAMEX> began looking for a permanent headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX> .
It set its sights on the estate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mason IV</ENAMEX> , The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cedars</ENAMEX> , located at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">2301 North Uhle Street</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> was one of the drafters of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Bill of Rights</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fellowship</ENAMEX> , also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Foundation</ENAMEX> , bought the property from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Piluso</ENAMEX> .
Although not much is known about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piluso</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Hughes</ENAMEX> , the man with whom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fellowship</ENAMEX> Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Owen Brewster</ENAMEX> once sparred , also lived there .
According to a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> official , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cedars</ENAMEX> had been used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> safe house prior to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fellowship</ENAMEX> 's purchase of the estate .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fellowship</ENAMEX> paid <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 million</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cedars</ENAMEX> , the money coming from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Phillips</ENAMEX> , the CEO of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Raytheon</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Olsen</ENAMEX> , the CEO of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital Equipment Corporation</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford McDonnell</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonnell Douglas Corporation</ENAMEX> was another deep - pocketed supporter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fellowship</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Full Gospel Business Men 's Fellowship International</ENAMEX> , an activity linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fellowship</ENAMEX> core member <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Robertson</ENAMEX> .
Suffer the little children , eh ?
If this is what power -AMP- wealth does to you , I 'm damn glad I have neither .
You said , `` Perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre-existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect . ''
Could n't agree more .
I think that pedophilia 's relative commonality is what really makes it frightening .
My experience happened when I was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> .
A friend of mine met this guy who was twice our age -AMP- who was more than willing to buy us all the whiskey we could drink .
We were both enamored with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerouac</ENAMEX> -AMP- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Morrison</ENAMEX> -AMP- meeting strange characters -AMP- this guy definitely fit the bill .
He was muscle for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> madam named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tex Gill</ENAMEX> .
She dressed like a man -AMP- ran most of the massage parlors in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pgh</ENAMEX> .
He was into black magick -AMP- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crowley</ENAMEX> -AMP- booze -AMP- drugs -AMP- on -AMP- on .
So , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> night , we 're at his apartment , drunk out of our minds ,
-AMP- my buddy passes out .
I continue drinking .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> point , I glance at this older guy ,
-AMP- he is staring at my buddy as a line of drool runs down the cigarette in his mouth -AMP- drips on to the floor .
I think , ' What the fuck ? '
but I 'm pretty goddamn wasted
-AMP- reality is having a helluva time penetrating the fog in my head .
He notices that I 'm kind of staring at him .
He stands up , walks into the bedroom , -AMP- comes back with a porno mag .
He drops it on the couch next to me .
As he 's sitting down , he says , `` See anything you like ? ''
-AMP- then he shoves his hand hard into my groin .....
.... -AMP- I broke his nose with my elbow .
Make no mistake though , up till that point , the guy scared the shit out of me .
But , lucky for me , my reaction was see red anger instead of cowering fear .
After i hit him , I jumped up , ran into his kitchen -AMP- grabbed a big old butcher knife , ran back into the room -AMP- proceeded to kick my buddy into consciousness -AMP- drag his comatose ass the hell out of there .
Now , for me , the interesting part happened years later .
At the time , my buddy -AMP- I were selling things .
My buddy had a real good supplier for these things but it was his secret .
At one point , my buddy could n't pick up the shipment so I had to go .
Before I left , he had to explain to me that his supplier was none other than Freddie Feelup .
I decided to go .
He was now closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</ENAMEX> -AMP- just a hollow shell of his former self .
Friendless , his only company being neighborhood teens looking to party .
He kept <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> room empty except for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</ENAMEX> black candles in each of its corners .
he would read curses aimed at people who pissed him off .
Really pathetic .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">About a year later</ENAMEX> , a few of those teens took an intense dislike to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freddie</ENAMEX> -AMP- the beat him to to death .
I ca n't imagine why .
Can you ?
I apologize for continuing my ramble but ... ,
... I do n't know how you folks would classify pedophilia .
Maybe a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 year old</ENAMEX> man -AMP- a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">15 year old</ENAMEX> boy does n't qualify .
I wonder about that myself , but I have to say that when I was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> , I was n't plying <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> year old girls with booze -AMP- copping feels .
I 'll shut up now .
Speaking of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Robertson</ENAMEX> -
I remembered something about him being linked with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Bout</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UAE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - step currently going on :
Bout was <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Liberian</ENAMEX> dictator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Taylor</ENAMEX> 's primary arms and diamond smuggler ...
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> , who is now in exile in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX> , was a business partner with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christian Coalition</ENAMEX> founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Robertson</ENAMEX> ... in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cayman Islands</ENAMEX> front company called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Freedom Gold , Ltd</ENAMEX> .
In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Freedom Gold</ENAMEX> was headquartered at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robertson</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBN</ENAMEX> offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia Beach</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robertson</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">African</ENAMEX> interests also crossed paths with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bout</ENAMEX> 's in another country -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the former Zaire</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robertson</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">African Development Company</ENAMEX> used the cover of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robertson</ENAMEX> 's tax - exempt `` Operation Blessing '' to ferry conflict diamonds out of civil war - ravaged <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zaire</ENAMEX> -LRB- now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Congo</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bout</ENAMEX> 's many assets is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New Millennium Air Company</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gambia</ENAMEX> .

My question is , when is a victim guilty of abuse ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> is definitely a mind - control , SRA victim .
He 's programmed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neverland</ENAMEX> sounds like a cryptic command from MKULTRA Wizard of Oz programming .
The bizarre from black - to - white and physical transformation must be the result of biotech advances .
If he does abuse ' his ' children , is he ' guilty ' as such if he is programmed ?
I suspect he is a brilliant cover or red - herring used as a shield by very powerful forces , responsible for God - knows - what at his now - abandoned ranch .
It 's very effective , as many ' feel ' that whilst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MJ</ENAMEX> is naive he 's not capable of the evil associated with pedophile activity .
This may not be the case , as the public ' persona ' is merely an ' alter ' personality and he may have many other ' personalities ' which are dark .
Then comes the question whether his programmers were programmed themselves .
If so , then they are all guilty of such abuse , whilst being innocent at the same time !
As most abuse is generational , the whole mind - control subject really has to be brought out in the open .
The very technology and tools used on the mind which harm can then be used to heal .
Brr , Pied Piper .
I remember being spooked by that story as a kid .
Heck of a story to tell children .
Talking about strange coincidences ... I was trying to write a science fiction story a while back involving <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Star Gate</ENAMEX> type research .
I was looking for a cool name for an undercover <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">X-Files</ENAMEX> type military - occult agency .
Thought of ' SPECTRE ' but that seemed too James Bondish , and modified it to ' SPECTRA ' .
Thinking rainbow - type symbology .
Then I find out that ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SPECTRA</ENAMEX> ' is actually a name with significance in the community .
What the ...
... of course , I did read a lot of weird stuff in passing as a kid ,
it 's certainly possible that I came across it and forgot .
I was n't consciously aware of it , certainly .
It 's the most disappointingly *cheesy* <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1960s</ENAMEX> sci - fi kind of name for an astral entity to use , that 's for sure .
I never did write that story .
Is n't <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> , and the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> clan , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jehovah 's Witness</ENAMEX> ?
There was no mention made of this in either the main post or comments ....
It would seem to me that their must be some relationship between that cult organization and all the `` high weirdness '' going on ....
no ?
.... and it is a cult .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> finally releases report on missing children .

I appreciate your candor and your capacity to build a knowledge base with each contributor adding to the thread that moves me in a sonambulant noiseless rush toward the truth .
We are living the dieing
and that is just as productive and rewarding as any other dimension of spirit that I have experienced
If there is just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing that disappoints me it is that all of the posters here prefer to be anonymous .
It would be wise for you to `` be '' yourself .
I tried to find emails for any that list a profile or website ,
but none `` NONE '' of you are out there .
Contact me at my profile email should you care to disclose yourself .
I would like to invite you to participate in FSHOD if that is not too much to ask .
maybe we remain anonymous in preparation for the future .
I 'm surprised I have n't heard this mentioned anywhere before , as it ties in perfectly with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bizarro Jacko</ENAMEX> Tabloid post :

Glad someone finally mentioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet</ENAMEX> .
I think the practice of black magic is something she and her brother have in common .
One mus n't forget her now infamous superbowl `` nipple '' stunt .
Rather than the ridiculous accident censors tried to make it out to be , I think it has to be recognized as a planned , purposeful piece of black magic , perpetraited literally in front of the world , on a very alchemically significant day and time
-LRB- goes way beyond a ' publicity stunt , does n't it ? ' -RRB-
A friend even suggests that her during her much earlier ' Rythm Nation ' period , in which she dons a black uniform and uses strange , synchopated hand movements in her video dance routine , that that too , is a kind of twilight language , intended on sending a specific message , in order to have a desired effect .
It 's possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jacksons</ENAMEX> have been using the occult arts for a long , long time .
I 'd love to hear someone else 's thoughts on this -
Here 's a link to just a wee bit more about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> and her alleged MPD -
http://dave.typepad.com/dave/2004/06/janet_jacksons_.html
I posted above that The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cedars</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> was mentioned as having stayed for a time , was the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Fellowship Foundation</ENAMEX> .
I just ran across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Fellowship Foundation</ENAMEX> again , when looking for something to explain the anomalous situation of recently - disgraced <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> shoplifter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude A. Allen</ENAMEX> .
The quote below is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">LaRouchies</ENAMEX> -- and thus , as always , not to be considered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</ENAMEX> reliable --
but in this case it fits in so well with the ongoing discussion that I 'm tentatively inclined to trust it :
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> 's career and power became at the same time a central project for all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> of the shadow partners , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grover Norquist</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Abramoff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Reed</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> was by no means a random point of interest .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom DeLay</ENAMEX> staggered into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> as a freshman Congressman in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> , a terrible drunk , his life dissolving .
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Wolf</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">R</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX> -RRB- approached him with a road to salvation .
He reportedly showed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> a videotape that made him weep .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom DeLay</ENAMEX> then radically changed his life , turning his soul over to higher powers .
But by all reliable accounts , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> became a much nastier , a fearsomely <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="3">un-Christian</ENAMEX> individual .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Wolf</ENAMEX> represented an old `` black operations '' soul - robbing agency known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Fellowship Foundation</ENAMEX> .
Practicing secrecy on about the same level as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Security Agency</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fellowship</ENAMEX> does conduct <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> public function --
it runs the huge annual Congressional / Presidential Prayer Breakfast in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , with similar events managed inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and at other government and military sites .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Fellowship Foundation</ENAMEX> -LRB- earlier called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Christian Leadership</ENAMEX> and a succession of cover names -RRB- was created before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> by the organization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="4">pro-Nazi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Buchman</ENAMEX> .
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Alexander Smith</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">R</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchman</ENAMEX> 's lieutenant who in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</ENAMEX> had called for a joint world dictatorship of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nazi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> , brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fellowship</ENAMEX> into acceptance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1950s</ENAMEX> , the group was sponsored by former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nazi</ENAMEX> SS officer , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holland</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Bernhard</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Dutch</ENAMEX> royal family .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fellowship</ENAMEX> runs a house near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the U.S. Capitol</ENAMEX> , where Congressmen and Senators , who are members , live .
For example , Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Brownback</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">R</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kans.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the delirious End - Timer , has lived in the cult 's house in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Raytheon</ENAMEX> CEO <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Phillips</ENAMEX> and other figures in the military - industrial complex , pay the bills .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fellowship</ENAMEX> specializes in taking over the lives of potentially powerful individuals who have become somehow ruined , and promising them dominion in the world if they will play along .
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> dirty - trickster <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Colson</ENAMEX> , when he was on his way to prison and suddenly powerless , was recruited , and turned his life over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fellowship</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colson</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prison Fellowship Ministries</ENAMEX> is a subordinate unit of the cult , with its tentacles in most prisons in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom DeLay</ENAMEX> was zapped , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Colson</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> 's personal guru .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colson</ENAMEX> 's militancy for the End - Times war on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Muslims</ENAMEX> has made him a congenial companion to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Abramoff</ENAMEX> in their keeping of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abramoff</ENAMEX> has repeatedly led <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> to call for all - out war against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabs</ENAMEX> .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christian Coalition</ENAMEX> co-founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Robertson</ENAMEX> was himself a product of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fellowship</ENAMEX> magic .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robertson</ENAMEX> was the good - for - nothing playboy son of Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Willis Robertson</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">R</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat</ENAMEX> began speaking in tongues and uttering prophecies under the guidance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harald Bredesen</ENAMEX> , a master training agent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fellowship</ENAMEX> group , who had proved himself to the highest circles of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> intelligence .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Robertson</ENAMEX> started off as assistant pastor to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bredesen</ENAMEX> , whose intelligence partners , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Full Gospel Businessmen 's Fellowship</ENAMEX> , raised the money to expand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robertson</ENAMEX> 's and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bredesen</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christian Broadcasting Network</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBN</ENAMEX> -RRB- toward global power status .
The sentence I put in boldface is *extremely* interesting .
Was n't there a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> video where he was envisioning himself as ruler of the world or some such ?
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anonymous 9:30</ENAMEX> re cults :
`` The reason fear can arise so strongly is that you already have a very strong experience of being brainwashed and used in cultish behavior .
This cult is called society and its ' cult - ure ' gives rise to suffering .
If you look closely , everything that is associated with cult behavior can lisewise be found in society 's behavior .
The same means of control are used : the constant reinforcement that you are helpless without society , that you can not survive without obeying its rules and that you will go to hell if you do n't obey the tenets of its religion . ''

this site monitors <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Jackson</ENAMEX> weight !
http://www.egotastic.com/entertainment/celebrities/janet-jackson/janet-jackson-is-too-fat-to-sing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anonymous One</ENAMEX> , I recall reading somewhere that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Marie</ENAMEX> was a member of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.Ron</ENAMEX> 's cult .
You will notice that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> 's real troubles started after he suied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Mattola</ENAMEX> , who was heard to say `` he 'll live to regret the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> '' .
Do n't ever think of fucken with the evil bastards in the Music biz , later .
Here 's a description of that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> item I was remembering :
By the time the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">HIStory</ENAMEX> album -- a double album of greatest hits and new tracks -- approached , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> had fully realized a new perception of himself , one that was truly larger than life .
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">HIStory</ENAMEX> was hyped with a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">minute</ENAMEX> teaser video .
This extravagant production begins with a colossal army goose - stepping through a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> city in crisp , tan uniforms , waving red flags and sporting red - and - black insignias .
Military music pounds .
Crowds swell at the sidelines , screaming and crying .
The implication seems to be these men represent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nazis</ENAMEX> .
But then , their leader is revealed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> , marching right up front .
When peasant workers break free to touch <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> , they are immediately swallowed by soldiers .
Suddenly , it is night , and a tarp - covered , skyscraper - sized structure looms over the poor nation as choppers spray spotlights across it .
Brainwashed fans scream , salute with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> arm and light candles with religious zeal .
Signs proclaiming `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King of Pop</ENAMEX> , '' a title <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> disavowed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oprah</ENAMEX> only <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years earlier</ENAMEX> , are everywhere , emphasizing the word `` King . ''
Finally , the tarp drops , and it is , of course , a gargantuan , bronze statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> , fists clenched defiantly , his star insignia prominent , yet his face still somehow child - like and unthreatening .
The video is a highly disturbing piece of work .
His bloated sense of importance is not only chilling , it is threatening .
Suddenly , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> 's perfect world of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Oz</ENAMEX> / <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Neverland</ENAMEX> is forced to be compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">an Aryan Nation</ENAMEX> , one that substitutes children for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> 's master race .
Large image of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">HIStory</ENAMEX> statue .
There is some sort of an emblem with a star on his shoulder , but it 's at an angle and not easy to make out clearly .
'' ... a haughty spirit goeth before a fall . ''
BTW - and off topic :
Check out this superb psyop image .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX> , I do n't think even you could do better than this :
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11800917/
Remember who <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet</ENAMEX> shared the stage with at the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Superbowl</ENAMEX> ?
Yes , you remember correctly : former Mousketeer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Justin Timberlake</ENAMEX> .
Hmmm .
The plot thickens .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">JW's</ENAMEX> and child abuse .
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/live_forums/2124808.stm
BTW <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX> - I 'd caught the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geller</ENAMEX> / <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> connection a while back and posted on the discussion board .
Fascinating how this all seems to be inter-related .
hmmm ...
in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2003</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> distraction - o - mania was part of the media smokescreen that led up <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Iraq war</ENAMEX> ...
and now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox news</ENAMEX> and other rabid - right media outlets have once again taken to whipping on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> ...
-LRB- like any sane people really care about what the hell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MJ</ENAMEX> is doing any more . -RRB-
A signs of another impending misadventure in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">mideast</ENAMEX> ?
And what 's with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uri Geller 's</ENAMEX> links to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MJ</ENAMEX> ?
Anyone else smell a whiff of that whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prophet Yahweh</ENAMEX> sideshow from awhile back ? trivial , but here 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stargods</ENAMEX> ' comprehensive analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jacko</ENAMEX> :
regarding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">JW</ENAMEX> reference .
I do n't think we need see a plot in every wood pile .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">JW</ENAMEX> considers itself THE kingdom of God on earth .
-LRB- ' Kindom Hall ' -RRB-
So it is only to be expected that they do not see a reason to run to and report everything to the government .
The same goes for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Roman Catholic Church</ENAMEX> .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RCC</ENAMEX> has had a widespread problem with this regard , doubltlessly because their policy / doctrine of a celibate priesthood simply attracts these deviants .
I doubt any such problem exist on the same proportionate scale in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">JW</ENAMEX> heirarchy .
Besides that , ca n't you see the embedded mind control in that article , as well as all general media output .
The Message Is : `` Big Brother must be informed !
Only Big Brother can manage society ! ''
See , it 's the Hegelian dialectic at work .
Eveyone needs to sharpen their awareness of this shit .
As long as Big Brother is the answer for everything , Big Brother will BE everything .
-LRB- If people do n't want their kids pederastized , but yet they entrust them to ' guys in gowns ' I just wonder what the hell are they thinking anyway ? -RRB-
I 'd watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Pan</ENAMEX> speculations , unless you know what versions you are discussing and can differentiate between them accurately .
Some of the assumptions I 've seen -LRB- such as a couple made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Boucher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fantastic Planet</ENAMEX> in last year 's postings linked here -RRB- may have looked like they worked to support their thesis , but in actuality have either a tenuous or no connection to the core <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Pan</ENAMEX> mythos .
Do n't make up things like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> abducting children that you ca n't substantiate .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Pan</ENAMEX> was a work in progress for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JM Barrie</ENAMEX> , who kept tinkering with it over the years .
To understand what it actually means to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> and what you might speculate he is enacting , you have to know where on the continuum of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Pans</ENAMEX> his internalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> -LRB- no , not THAT kind of peter -RRB- lies .
Novel , play ?
Musical , cartoon ?
Shadow of a shadow of a remembered story ?
In one of the oldest versions , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</ENAMEX> -LRB- extracted from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Little White Bird</ENAMEX> -RRB- , is only a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week old</ENAMEX> .
He escaped from his home when he was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days old</ENAMEX> because he remembered how he could fly when he was a bird before he was a human ,
and that wildness is still in him , as it is with all children .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrie</ENAMEX> 's only cryptic instructions on character development to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nina Boucicault</ENAMEX> , the first actress to play <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> , was that she was to remember that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> is a bird , and is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one day old</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kensington Gardens</ENAMEX> he watches out for children who have fallen un-noticed out of their perambulators .
If a bad fairy finds them , or they perish from the cold an dark overnight in the park , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> digs them graves and makes them headstones .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peter and Wendy</ENAMEX> , the Lost Boys are the ones who fall out of their perambulators when their nurse is not looking .
If they are not claimed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</ENAMEX> , `` they are sent far away to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Neverland</ENAMEX> to defray expenses . ''
A far cry from the stealing of children .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> and the Lost Boys crave a mother to tell them stories .
It 's ironic that while their own lives are far more exotic than the fairy tales <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX> tells , it 's those fictions that they want , told by a mother .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrie</ENAMEX> says quite explicitly in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peter and Wendy</ENAMEX> that it is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX> who does the tempting to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> with her , not the other way around .
It is she who asks if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> could come too .
If those of you with the abduction theory would like to give specific quotes and information on where it is shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> abducted the children , please do .
But I think you are making it up from a version that does n't exist in reality , or that ca n't be tied to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> .
We do n't gain better understanding of the inner workings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> by distorting the material on which we purportedly base our theories .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX> - I just have to say that I love the Rigorous Intuition Live365 channel .
I 've been listening to it to the last couple of days and just bought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylan</ENAMEX> 's ' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oh Mercy</ENAMEX> ' .
How does the copyright thing work on a Live365 stream ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avalon</ENAMEX> , can you recommend a good work of commentary and analysis on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JM Barrie 's</ENAMEX> works ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">- Sepka the Space Weasel</ENAMEX>
Was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Fosse 's</ENAMEX> `` Snake in the grass '' character from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</ENAMEX> movie <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Little Prince</ENAMEX> ?
Has anyone else seen this scene ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Fosse 's</ENAMEX> snake looks and moves would be imitated -LRB- and made more popular -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">the King of Pop</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> .

About the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">JW</ENAMEX> thing , I work with a couple of them -LRB- BTW , some of the most respectable people I know .
Which is why I decided to ask ... -RRB- ,
and I had a chance to ask them about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MJ</ENAMEX> and the child abuse , if they knew anything .
About <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MJ</ENAMEX> they said , he is definately not a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">JW</ENAMEX> , despite what he says .
Provocative lyrics and grabbing ones crotch in public , does n't fit with their defination of ' <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christian</ENAMEX> ' .
They said all they knew was that his mother -LRB- who apparently is still a member -RRB- took him to their church as a kid .
The father apparently had little or no involvement at all .
As for the child abuse , I have to agree with the post above , you can find abuse and ' sick ' individuals in ANY organization ,
but you have too look at the proportion to the rest of society .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of my friends is an ' elder ' -LRB- soething like a ' local church leader ' -RRB- ,
but he also said their instructions say that if they hear of any abuse they are to follow local laws , which usually requires them to inform the police ASAP .
And if the abuse is at all serious to report it to the police regardless .
Though i do n't agree with all of their beliefs , I know these guys well enough to call them friends .
So in their respect , after reading some of the other comments , I decided to listen to their side before passing judgement .
We should ALL be careful not to pass judgement on ENTIRE groups of people based on the apparent actions of a few .
That is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> tried to do .
With thiking like that , even if we got rid of the evil elite , a new set of ' evil elite ' would rise again in their place .
That seems to be the nature of man , though .
We have all got to do what we can without needlessly attacking the innocent .
Remember , group hatred only plays into their hands , be it racial , religious , or class .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sepka</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> reference books I have on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Pan</ENAMEX> are : <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fifty Years of Peter Pan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Lancelyn Green</ENAMEX> , pub. by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Peter Davies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</ENAMEX> .
It 's pretty scarce at this point , though you might be able to find a copy to read through inter-library loan .
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Peter Pan Chronicles</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce K. Hanson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Birch Lane Press</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NY</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</ENAMEX>
I have n't really delved into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrie</ENAMEX> 's psyche from the biographical end , it 's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peter and Wendy</ENAMEX> as an extraordinary piece of writing that has always fascinated me .
... and if you listen to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">My Way</ENAMEX> '' by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sinatra</ENAMEX> , backwards , the real answer will be revealed .
http://stargods.org/MasonicMichaelJackson.htm
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uri Geller</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MJ</ENAMEX> 's handlers apparently .
