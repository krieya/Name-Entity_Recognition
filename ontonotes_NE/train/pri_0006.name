This is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the World</ENAMEX> .
I 'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Mullins</ENAMEX> .
Not since he took power <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">13 years ago</ENAMEX> , has <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> 's President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> appeared so close to losing it .
His grip began to slip on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 24th</ENAMEX> , when as even he admitted opposition candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vojislav Kostunica</ENAMEX> won more votes in a nation - wide election .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> claimed , however , that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kostunica</ENAMEX> had failed to win <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 50 %</ENAMEX> and that another ballot would be necessary .
The opposition insisted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kostunica</ENAMEX> had won outright and staged mass anti-Milosevic demonstrations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , the protest reached a climax as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</ENAMEX> of people took to the streets of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> .
The crowds took over the parliament building and a state television center and the events of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> resembled nothing so much as a popular revolution .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">World</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nenad Chebeck</ENAMEX> takes us to the streets of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Serbian</ENAMEX> capital in his eyewitness report .
Rock drummer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dragon Zuricic</ENAMEX> pounded out a beat for marching and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</ENAMEX> of demonstrators took up the call .
Within <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</ENAMEX> , the center of the town was blocked solid .
Opponents of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> called on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> President to relinquish power immediately .
An opposition spokesman demanded that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> accept the electoral will of the people , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Electoral Commission</ENAMEX> reveal what she called the true result of the election .
There were speeches and even songs , denouncing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> and praising opposition leader , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vojislav Kostunica</ENAMEX> , but the singing stopped and at least some shooting began .
The crowd converged at the federal parliament building and tried to storm it .
The police retaliated with tear gas and most streets around the buildings were full of people and tear gas .
The mood became angry and several police cars were smashed or set ablaze .
Then the demonstrators turned their fury towards a nearby police station .
That 's when the mass protest took what may have been a `` turning point '' .
The police gave themselves up without a fight and some of them even joined the demonstrators .
Then the crowd marched over to the state run televison station .
Much to the demonstrators ' surprise dozens of heavily armed riot policemen simply walked out of the building and offered no resistance .
Elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> , journalists at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> other television stations and the radio station <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">B92</ENAMEX> took over their newsrooms vowing to report independently of state control .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">This evening</ENAMEX> , police withdrew from the streets of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> .
Outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Parliament</ENAMEX> building , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</ENAMEX> gathered for a rally .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vojislav Kostunica</ENAMEX> appealed to them to stay on the streets and defend democracy .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kostunica</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> took the country into several wars and now wanted to wage a battle against his own people .
The crowd chanted `` arrest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobo</ENAMEX> and let 's march onto <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beveneary 3rd</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> 's residence .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kostunica</ENAMEX> advised calm .
What he did n't say was what he could n't , which is where exactly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> is .
He has n't been seen or heard from in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the past 24 hours</ENAMEX> .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The World</ENAMEX> , this is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nenad Chebeck</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> .
