After enduring <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</ENAMEX> of heavy selling , the beleaguered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> over - the - counter market finally rebounded , rising sharply in hearty trading .
The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7 %</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.35</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">463.28</ENAMEX> .
It rose more than the New York Stock Exchange Composite , which improved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</ENAMEX> .
Among bigger stocks , the Nasdaq 100 Index rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.56</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">453.05</ENAMEX> , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Bruno</ENAMEX> , head of OTC trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> , said the OTC market has a habit of lagging big moves on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
While the industrial average rallied on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Friday 's</ENAMEX> collapse , the OTC market , which did n't suffer too badly during the correction , tumbled .
`` Our market got hit a lot harder on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> than the listed market , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruno</ENAMEX> said .
`` We 're just recovering and getting back to business as usual .
I 'm encouraged by the action . ''
The trading pace was busy , with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,343</ENAMEX> issues and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">147.6 million</ENAMEX> shares changing hands .
Advancing issues beat declining ones , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,271</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">811</ENAMEX> .
Much of the jockeying by OTC traders and investors centered on shares of companies that might be financially affected by damage from the devastating earthquake in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> .
As investors speculated about the long - and short - term implications , shares of a number of companies that might either profit or face problems because of the disaster were actively traded .
Heading the list : insurance , construction and technology companies located in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the San Francisco Bay Area</ENAMEX> .
Insurance - related stocks were mixed as investors tried to figure out how to assess the impact of the property damage and deaths on those concerns .
Traders said property - casualty companies with the heaviest exposure in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area include the OTC 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Safeco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ohio Casualty</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Gilmartin</ENAMEX> , a trader who follows insurance stocks for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox - Pitt Kelton</ENAMEX> , said his strategy was to sell early .
Then , if the stocks fell sharply , he planned to begin buying them aggressively , on the theory that the companies that insure against property damage and accidents will have to raise rates eventually to compensate for the claims they will pay to earthquake victims and victims of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .
As well , reinsurers and insurance brokerage companies will have improved profits .
Many investors expected damage from the hurricane to be the catalyst for higher rates in the industry , which has been depressed because of low rates arising from intense competition .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilmartin</ENAMEX> said the hurricane damage was n't extensive enough to prompt premium boosts .
`` The companies just gave back what they had reserved for , '' he said .
`` Now , they 'll have to increase their coffers to protect for the future and that means rate increases . ''
