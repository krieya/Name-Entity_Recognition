<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> : Storied Past , Uncertain Future
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin I - hsien</ENAMEX> / photos by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diago Chiu</ENAMEX> / tr. by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Newell</ENAMEX> -RRB-
I wonder if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> is jealous of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tanshui</ENAMEX> .
I ask because fate has treated these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> towns , separated only by the mouth of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Tanshui River</ENAMEX> , very differently .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tanshui</ENAMEX> is celebrated in poems , songs , paintings , and lovers ' memories of its scenic views .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> has donuts , mussels , a garbage landfill , and troubles which have yet to be revealed to the outside world .
Have you heard this legend ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liao Tianding</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Hood</ENAMEX> , fleeing from imperial soldiers , took refuge in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> , where he fell in love with a local woman , and , later , at age <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">27</ENAMEX> , was murdered in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Monkey Cave</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laochienkeng</ENAMEX> -LRB- in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali Rural Township</ENAMEX> -RRB- by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of his best friends .
Countless legends grew up around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liao</ENAMEX> after his death , and the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> began to worship his spirit .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</ENAMEX> , his small burial plot was converted into a huge temple .
He has followers scattered far and wide , and every year on the special day appointed for making offerings at his temple -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 26th day of the 10th month of the lunar calendar</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the grounds are packed with cars and visitors .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ko</ENAMEX> brothers , now in their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">60s</ENAMEX> , recall their impressions of a visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liao Tianding</ENAMEX> gravesite : " It must have been <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years ago</ENAMEX> , we used to go there just for the fun of it .
The road in front of the temple was n't so wide then , and what a crowd !
People were so jammed in you could n't move . "
They also recall that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> of those days was a place in which most people lived by fishing , farming , or petty trading .
The elder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ko</ENAMEX> gives a thumbs - up and declares : " That 's why I always say that a can - do guy like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liao Tianding</ENAMEX> must be looking after us , so that we have developed and can even earn money from the tourists . "
Yet , he may not know about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> 's real heyday , long in the past .
The days of the sailing ships
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> was originally called <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palifen</ENAMEX> , a transliteration of the place name used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Ketagalan</ENAMEX> indigenous people .
Located on the northwest corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> faces <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Taiwan Strait</ENAMEX> to the northwest , rests against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mt. Kuanyin</ENAMEX> to the southeast , and looks across the river toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tanshui</ENAMEX> to the northeast .
Though it does n't have much of a hinterland , its geographic location has proved historically important , as one can see from the prehistoric cultures unearthed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Ta - pen - keng</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Shih - san - hang</ENAMEX> archeological sites .
Later , when <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Han Chinese</ENAMEX> began trickling across to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , they mainly settled along rivers .
Because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> is relatively close to the mainland and sits at the mouth of a river , despite the fact that it does not have a natural harbor , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1757</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Qing</ENAMEX> court designated it to be one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's small number of official ports for maritime transport with the mainland .
Thus began an era in which great ships sailed in and out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> .
However , as a result of silting and a destructive typhoon that struck in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1796</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> began to give way in importance to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tanshui</ENAMEX> , located just across the river .
Once mainly dependent on fishing , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> increasingly came to rely on farming .
But the hilly terrain and strong winds meant that there was little good land .
While the hardy people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> barely kept their stomachs filled , their children and grandchildren left in search of a better life .
Neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> occupation -LRB- which began in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</ENAMEX> -RRB- nor the return to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> rule -LRB- in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</ENAMEX> -RRB- brought much joy or change to this rural area .
But in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</ENAMEX> , urban planning came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> .
It proved to be the prelude to a symphony -LRB- or perhaps cacophony -RRB- of transformation .
Changing the rhythm of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> life
During the height of real estate speculation and soaring land prices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> , builders put up self - described " villas " and " mansions " -LRB- apartment blocks , in fact -RRB- one after another in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> .
Also , to try to reduce the outflow of population from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> and to get the stagnant local economy moving , the government decided to link this formerly isolated village to the outside world .
What had been <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chungshan Road</ENAMEX> was turned into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Provincial Highway #15</ENAMEX> , and the opening of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Kuantu Bridge</ENAMEX> to traffic linked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> directly to the busy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> districts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shilin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peitou</ENAMEX> .
Gifted with a lovely setting between the mountains and the sea , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> began to dream of a tourism boom .
But fortune had other things in store .
In order to pave the way for the construction of a water treatment facility on the northeast edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> , the plan to develop tourism in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> was scrapped overnight .
The government , applying urban planning principles , zoned the area for residential and industrial use , in order to create a construction site for the facility .
Then in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> came the program to bring gravel from eastern to western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> for construction purposes , and a harbor was built on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> coast for the convenience of gravel transporters .
In accordance with the urban plan , new streets were cut this way and that through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> 's land , and high - rise buildings sprang up along the sides of these roadways .
The sounds of backhoes at work resounded even from the black sand beaches .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hsiachuotzu</ENAMEX> garbage landfill formally opened , and it became common to see fleets of garbage trucks winding through the streets of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> .
This rural township , which was made responsible for storing the garbage from several communities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei County</ENAMEX> , seemed resigned to the fate -LRB- suffered by many outlying areas -RRB- of having to choke on the garbage spit up by others .
It is only recently that the residents of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hsiachuotsu</ENAMEX> , unable to stand the smell , have begun to protest .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin Yi - hung</ENAMEX> , born and raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> , stands on the roof of his house and looks across to the beach where he used to run and play as a child .
He can not help but sigh , as he looks at the ranks of new buildings and thinks of the dramatic changes that have come to this area : " These construction projects have destroyed the relationship we people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> used to have with the sea . "
It 's certainly true that a lot of people here thought they would get rich from the rezoning .
But just because land increases in value does n't mean someone will buy it , and just because apartment complexes are built does n't mean there are people who want to live there .
Worst of all , interpersonal relationships have been poisoned in the struggle over divvying up the profits , because no one really knows how much money is involved .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin</ENAMEX> concludes : " I am not by any means opposed to development .
But development is not necessarily the same as progress .
Can the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> really survive change of this magnitude ? "
All part of the plan ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> after another , government development plans have raised the expectations of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> residents .
But so far the only things <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> folk have been able to enjoy have been flying dust from construction sites , roads filled with giant trucks , and new neighbors of an " otherworldly " kind .
The new roads have certainly brought in a group of immigrants anxious to escape from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei City</ENAMEX> and return to nature .
But at the same time , verdant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mt. Kuanyin</ENAMEX> - named for its uncanny resemblance to the deity Kuanyin - is covered with columbariums and cemeteries .
Even Kuanyin , worshipped for her limitless compassion and mercy , must be creasing her brow at this rampant overuse of the mountain .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Chien - kuo</ENAMEX> , a secretary in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali Rural Township</ENAMEX> government , says facetiously : " What can we do ? We have the mountains behind us and the sea in front .
People say the fengshui is good here , so they come . "
He adds , in a far less amused tone , that the government has been talking about making <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mt. Kuanyin</ENAMEX> a national park for a long time , and has banned construction or use of the mountain .
But after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</ENAMEX> , the park plan is still a non-starter , and meanwhile many cemeteries and colum - bariums have " snuck in . "
" Nobody seems to care about our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> , and we are very remote , so people just dump what they do n't want out here .
We say that this is why we not only have a water pollution treatment plant and a garbage landfill , but also five nursing homes and hospices for the terminally ill . "
Take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Taipei Happy Mountain Colony</ENAMEX> for example .
This venerable institution was first used to house leprosy victims , who met only fear and loathing elsewhere .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> missionary founded this home - over the strong opposition of the local gentry - to offer leprosy victims a place to live in dignity and find warmth away from the cold outside world .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Happy Mountain</ENAMEX> is a home for physically and mentally challenged young people , and the simple old structure , surrounded by greenery , rings with the laughter of children .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Li - chuan</ENAMEX> , who works at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Happy Mountain</ENAMEX> , was born and raised right here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> .
Her family home is not far from the chil - dren 's home .
" When I was small I used to come here to play .
All the adults called the kids ' empty - headed . '
I was small , and did n't know any better , so I just called them that too . "
Stroking the head of a sleeping child with hydrocephalus , she says : " He is so cute when he smiles ! "
Located on the margins of the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> take it in stride that they must live alongside the marginal people and objects cast off by society - waste water , trash , the deceased , and victims of diseases that society would prefer not to see at all .
And there is no sign this situation will end : Reports now say that all the waste and earth being moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Linkou</ENAMEX> for a land reclamation project there will be trucked along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Provincial Highway #15</ENAMEX> - right through the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> .
Serving Greater <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX>
" I believe , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin Yi - hung</ENAMEX> , " that the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> understand that this is just the way society works -
the interests of the few are sacrificed so that the majority can be better off . "
Thus , in urban plans <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> is always assigned the role of serving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> .
" But the government should think carefully about whether they are using the right methods or not .
There are no real comprehensive policies , just short - term trade - offs of interests .
There are a lot of great - sounding plans , but what do the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> get out of them ?
It 's like the port they built for transporting gravel .
There are a lot of bright promises for the future , raising people 's hopes , but who knows what the final result will really be ? "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Tsu - chou</ENAMEX> , now in his <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">70s</ENAMEX> , has been a secretary in the rural township government for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 30 years</ENAMEX> , and loves <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> more than words can say .
" I was first sent here to work in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Kuomintang Public Service Department</ENAMEX> .
When I came here , they were only selling <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30</ENAMEX> newspapers in all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> .
But I went all out to promote newspaper sales , and by the time I left the department , they were selling <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1000</ENAMEX> ! "
He has great confidence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> 's future , and believes the new harbor will bring prosperity .
" The government says that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> phase is for transporting gravel , but when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> phase is completed a lot of goods will be shipped in and out of here .
At that time , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> should really be hopping ! "
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> , known as " the home of green bamboo shoots " for its famous local vegetable , is - like many remote areas all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> - accepting the pain and enjoying the pleasures of life in the space between hopeful expectations and disappointing letdowns .
And , being marginal , it also must live with burdens that the citizens themselves do not want .
Uncertain whether to makes fists or open their arms , the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pali</ENAMEX> watch , perplexed , as the great wheel of our times leaves its tracks through their rural township .
Yet these are hardy people , who will always bounce back with a smile to face the unknown future , be it filled with troubles or glory .
