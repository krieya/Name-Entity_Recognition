<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall .
In a report on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's foundering economy , the official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State Statistical Bureau</ENAMEX> disclosed that industrial output <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> - the lowest growth rate in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
Retail sales are plummeting , while consumer prices still are rising .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> and foreign economists now predict prolonged stagflation : low growth and high inflation .
`` The economy is crashing hard , '' says an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> economist in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
`` The slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and devastatingly than anyone had expected . ''
A lengthy recession , if it materializes , would drain state coffers and create severe hardships for urban workers .
Experts predict <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming year</ENAMEX> will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth , rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit .
Unless the government suddenly reverses course , wages for most workers wo n't keep pace with inflation , creating a potential source of urban unrest .
The economy 's slowdown is due only partly to the austerity program launched in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1988</ENAMEX> to cool an overheated economy and tame inflation .
-LRB- Industrial output surged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , while inflation peaked <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last February</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 30 %</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
The slowdown also results from chronic energy and raw - materials shortages that force many factories to restrict operations to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three days</ENAMEX> a week .
In Western , market - driven countries , recessions often have a bright side : prodding the economy to greater efficiency .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , however , there is n't likely to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">state</ENAMEX> .
Instead , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is likely to shell out ever - greater subsidies to its coddled state - run enterprises , which ate up <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18 billion</ENAMEX> in bailouts <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
Nor are any of these inefficient monoliths likely to be allowed to go bankrupt .
Rather , the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast - growing private and semi-private `` township '' enterprises , which have fallen into disfavor as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's leaders re-emphasize an orthodox <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Marxist</ENAMEX> preference for public ownership .
`` When the going gets rough , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent , '' says a Western economist .
Reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Communist Party</ENAMEX> plenum for sometime in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few weeks</ENAMEX> .
The meeting is expected to call for heightened austerity for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> .
But with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing signs of easing , some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy .
Some analysts believe <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> soon will begin relaxing economic controls , particularly by loosening credit .
That would benefit <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> enterprises as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sino</ENAMEX> - foreign joint ventures , both of which have been plagued by shortages of working capital .
A dangerous buildup <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</ENAMEX> in inter-company debts threatens , if unchecked , to bring the economy to a collapse .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">People 's Bank of China</ENAMEX> , the central bank , to allocate <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.4 billion</ENAMEX> in short - term loans to pay farmers for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</ENAMEX> harvest , the official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">China Daily</ENAMEX> reported .
But while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries , it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation .
The cycle has been repeated several times since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> began reforming its planned economy in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</ENAMEX> .
And , because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy , it is likely to continue , analysts say .
The statistical bureau 's report , cited in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">China Daily</ENAMEX> , notes that industrial output in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> totaled <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 29.4 billion</ENAMEX> , a rise of just <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> .
Output declined in several provinces , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jiangsu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhejiang</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> key coastal areas , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sichuan</ENAMEX> , the nation 's agricultural breadbasket .
Production in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government , fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</ENAMEX> .
Nationwide , output of light industrial products declined <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</ENAMEX> -- `` the first decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</ENAMEX> , '' a bureau spokesman told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">China Daily</ENAMEX> .
In an unusually direct statement , the bureau spokesman recommended that state banks extend more credit to shopkeepers so that they can purchase manufacturers ' goods .
`` This will prevent a slide in industrial production , which will otherwise cause new panic buyings , '' the spokesman said .
