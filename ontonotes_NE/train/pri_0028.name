This is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The World</ENAMEX> , I am <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Mullins</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> coastline is a sear for terrorists , but it was the best option available for refueling ships .
That 's what General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Zinni</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate Arms Services Committee</ENAMEX> hearing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zinny</ENAMEX> was in charge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the US Central Command</ENAMEX> at the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> contracted for refueling services in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> port of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December of 1998</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> he took full responsibility for that decision saying I pass that buck on to nobody .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> officials say they now have a description of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the suicide bombers and that mounting evidence suggests that the plot to bomb <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the USS Cole</ENAMEX> may have originated in a remote corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">World</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katy Clark</ENAMEX> has the latest on the investigation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> security officials <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> said that during a search <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this week</ENAMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> apartment that turned out bomb making equipment , investigators also found documents they believe originated in the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> province of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hydra Mount</ENAMEX> .
The region is home to several tribal groups that have been known to kidnap foreigners for ransom .
Security officials also linked documents found in the vehicle believed to be used by the attackers to the region .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> investigators went to the province of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hydra Mount</ENAMEX> hoping to identify the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> men who used the apartment .
They have n't been seen since the bombing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week ago</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> director , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Freeh</ENAMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> to view the investigation first hand .
After meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> 's President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Free</ENAMEX> told a news conference that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> 's role there is strictly supports .
The investigation is being run by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> police and security authorities .
We are the junior partner .
We are very pleased with the progress of the investigation .
In fact I complimented the President for the very good investigative work they have done , particularly in finding several locations which we feel may be relevant to the case .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> director also toured the wreckage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the USS Cole</ENAMEX> and described it as a tangled mass of metal and wire .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Free</ENAMEX> said that the situation on board is a recovery mission as much as it is a crime scene .
When asked who he suspected was behind the attack , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Free</ENAMEX> cautioned it 's still too soon to draw conclusions .
We do n't want to be speculating .
What we want to be doing now is investigating and that 's what we do , though we do it best if we do it based on the facts .
Facts , which appear to be growing clearer with each day .
Speaking on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arabic</ENAMEX> satellite television <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali Abdullah Saleh</ENAMEX> said investigators have found a workshop they believe was used to build the engine for the boat that transported the explosives out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> .
They have also interviewed eye witnesses and put together a composite sketch of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the suicide bombers .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> President said he has a beard and wears glasses but we do n't know the description of the other person .
The question here is , are they <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> nationals ?
The documents show they are from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hydra Mount</ENAMEX> .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sallah</ENAMEX> described the attack as an octopus of an operation and said it was clear it had been carefully planned .
Closer to home , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Arms Services Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> began an examination of the policy that allowed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> to dock in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> will be staging its own independent investigation into circumstances surrounding the bombing and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> named retired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> Admiral <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Geeman</ENAMEX> and retired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Army</ENAMEX> General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Crouch</ENAMEX> to lead that probe .
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">World</ENAMEX> I am <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katy Clark</ENAMEX> .
