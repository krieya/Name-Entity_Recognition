<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Engelken</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Thomson</ENAMEX> had never met , though for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">38 years</ENAMEX> their lives had been intertwined in a way peculiar to the sports world .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> , now a transit - association executive in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> , a paper - products salesman in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montvale</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , had n't even talked to each other .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one recent day</ENAMEX> , they became much closer .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> , a rabid baseball fan , pores over the sports pages to chart the exploits of `` my favorite and not - so - favorite teams and players . ''
He often groans , he says , at the `` clutter '' of sports stories about drugs , alcohol , gambling and some player 's lament `` about <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the miserly millions</ENAMEX> he is offered to play the game . ''
His <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> paper , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Washington Post</ENAMEX> , even carries a sports column called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jurisprudence</ENAMEX> '' that recounts the latest arrests and convictions of players and team managers .
Like many sports buffs , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> has turned cynic .
But his is a story about a hero in an era of sports anti-heroes , and about what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Babe Ruth</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> reminds us , once called `` the only real game in the world . ''
To Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> , it is also a story `` about love , because I 'm blessed to have a wife who still thinks her slightly eccentric husband 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">50th</ENAMEX> birthday deserves the ultimate present . ''
To understand what Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> means , one must go back to a sunny <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Polo Grounds</ENAMEX> stadium , where , it can be argued , the most dramatic moment in baseball history was played out .
It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</ENAMEX> inning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> game of a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> - game playoff between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Brooklyn Dodgers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Giants</ENAMEX> -LRB- the predecessor to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the San Francisco Giants</ENAMEX> scheduled to play in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">world series</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Baseball fans throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> had sweated out <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a long summer</ENAMEX> with their teams , and now it had come to this : a battle between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National League</ENAMEX> pennant -- down to the last inning of the last game , no less .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 34,320</ENAMEX> fans jammed the stands , and shouted at the top of their lungs .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> was doing the same across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Hudson River</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> , where , with his nose pressed against the front window of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Passaic - Clifton National Bank</ENAMEX> , he watched the duel on a television set the bank set up for the event .
The playoff series had riveted the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">12 - year - old</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Giants</ENAMEX> fan .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Giants</ENAMEX> struck <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> , winning the opener , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</ENAMEX> - 1 , on a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - run homer off <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Dodger</ENAMEX> right - hander <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Branca</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> recalls with precision <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Giants</ENAMEX> got swamped in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> game , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> , and trailed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</ENAMEX> - 1 going into the bottom of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> and deciding game .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Giants</ENAMEX> scored once and had runners on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitey Lockman</ENAMEX> -RCB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clint Hartung</ENAMEX> -RCB- as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> advanced to the plate . ''
The rest , as they say , is history .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> , a tall , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Scottish</ENAMEX> - born , right - hand hitter , stepped into the batter 's box .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> took a called strike , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> recounts .
The tension mounted as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Branca</ENAMEX> , again on the mound , stared down the batter .
He wound up and let loose a fastball .
The pitch sailed toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> high and inside and then , with a crack of the bat , was sent rocketing back into the lower leftfield stands .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Giants</ENAMEX> fans went into euphoria , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> was made a legend .
The same <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> , it turns out , who sells those paper - goods <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
There ca n't be an older baseball fan alive who does n't clearly remember that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> homer , who ca n't tell you where he was when he heard the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russ Hodges</ENAMEX> radio broadcast -- the one that concluded with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hodges</ENAMEX> shouting , over and over , `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Giants</ENAMEX> win the pennant , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Giants</ENAMEX> win the pennant ! ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> drifted in different directions in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the subsequent years</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Polo Grounds</ENAMEX> , located under <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Coogan 's Bluff</ENAMEX> in upper <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> , was replaced by a public - housing project .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> played outfield and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> base until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</ENAMEX> , posting a lifetime <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.270</ENAMEX> batting average and chalking up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">264</ENAMEX> home runs before retiring and going into paper - goods sales .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> moved south to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , but he took with him enduring memories of the homer of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</ENAMEX> .
When his wife , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX> , came down the aisle on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">their wedding day in 1966</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> -- no slouch on the romantic front -- gave her the ultimate compliment : `` You look prettier than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson 's</ENAMEX> home run . ''
The couple 's first dog , Homer , was named after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Great Event</ENAMEX> , though unwitting friends assumed he was the namesake of the poet .
And when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> 's sister , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX> , who was born <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</ENAMEX> before the home run , reached her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">25th</ENAMEX> birthday , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> wrote his sports hero to tell him of the coincidence of events .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> sent off a card to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX> : `` It does n't seem like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years</ENAMEX> since I hit that home run to celebrate your birth , '' it read .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX> was pleased , but nowhere near as much as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> .
The family license plate reads `` ENG 23 , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> letters of the family name and -- no surprise here -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson 's</ENAMEX> uniform number .
And on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">40th</ENAMEX> birthday , his wife bought a book detailing the big homer and sent it off to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> to be autographed .
`` What could have been better ? '' asks Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy Engelken</ENAMEX> asked the same question <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> , when her husband was about to turn <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50</ENAMEX> .
She had an idea .
On her husband 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">50th</ENAMEX> birthday -LRB- after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">an auspicious 23 years</ENAMEX> of marriage , it should be noted -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al</ENAMEX> and their college - bound son set out for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fordham University</ENAMEX> .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> had scheduled a stop on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the New Jersey Turnpike</ENAMEX> to , she told her husband , pick up some papers for a neighbor .
The papers would be handed over at a bank of telephone booths just off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exit 10</ENAMEX> .
`` It sounded like something out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian Fleming</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> recalls .
At the appointed exit , the family pulled over , and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> went to get her papers .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> turned off the motor and rolled down the window .
In a matter of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</ENAMEX> , she was back , with a tall , silver - haired man in tow .
She crouched down by the car window and addressed her husband with her favorite nickname :
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertie</ENAMEX> , '' she said , `` Happy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">50th</ENAMEX> Birthday .
This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> . ''
`` And there he was , '' recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> .
`` The hero of my youth , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> person in history I 'd most like to meet .
Keep your <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jeffersons</ENAMEX> , or St. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augustines</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelos</ENAMEX> ; I 'd take baseball 's Flying Scot without hesitation . ''
They talked of the home run .
`` I thought it was in the upper deck , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> , now <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">66 years old</ENAMEX> .
They talked of the aftermath .
`` I never thought it would become so momentous , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby</ENAMEX> remarked .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> , says his wife , `` was overwhelmed by the whole thing .
It was worth it , just for the look on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert</ENAMEX> 's face . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> men spent <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exit 10</ENAMEX> , rehashing the event , `` fulfilling the lifelong dream of a young boy now turned <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> says .
His hero signed photographs of the homer and diplomatically called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Branca</ENAMEX> `` a very fine pitcher . ''
And when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> asked him why he took time off from work for somebody he did n't even know , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> replied : `` You know , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert</ENAMEX> , if you have the chance in life to make somebody this happy , you have an obligation to do it . ''
In an interview , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> , who is married and has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> grown children , says he has few ties to baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> , other than playing old - timers games now and again .
But his fans , to his constant amazement , never let him forget the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - bagger .
His mail regularly recalls `` my <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> event , '' and has been growing in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> .
In response to the letters , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> usually sends an autographed photo with a polite note , and rarely arranges a rendezvous .
But when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy Engelken</ENAMEX> wrote him , saying she could stop near his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> home , it seemed different .
`` What a good feeling it would be for me to do that , '' he says he thought .
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> family got back from its trip up north , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> wrote it all down , just to make sure no detail was missed .
`` On the way home , '' his notes recall , `` it took concentrated effort to keep that car pointed south .
My mind was <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</ENAMEX> north at a place called <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Coogan 's Bluff</ENAMEX> , where a real sports hero had captured the imagination of a kid who never fully grew up and is all the richer for it .
`` Take heart , sports fans , '' he wrote .
`` Real heroes exist .
You might not find one in the ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jurisprudence</ENAMEX> ' column .
But who knows ?
You might meet up with him at that bank of telephone booths just off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exit 10</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the New Jersey Turnpike</ENAMEX> .
