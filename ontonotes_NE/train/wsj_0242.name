Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> allies are complaining that President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is pushing conventional - arms talks too quickly , creating a risk that negotiators will make errors that could affect the security of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Western Europe</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> .
Concerns about the pace of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX> talks -- which are aimed at the destruction of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 100,000</ENAMEX> weapons , as well as major reductions and realignments of troops in central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> -- also are being registered at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has called for an agreement by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next September</ENAMEX> at the latest .
But some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> defense officials believe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the North Atlantic Treaty Organization</ENAMEX> should take more time to examine the long - term implications of the options being considered .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> officials , who asked not to be identified , worry that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> will have a much tougher time persuading <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Europeans</ENAMEX> to keep some short - range nuclear weapons on their soil once <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> armored forces are thinned out .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the same time</ENAMEX> , they contend that a reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> attack unless the West retains a residual force of nuclear weapons in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> .
Allies concerned about the deadline include the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> and smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> allies , some of whom do n't have adequate staffs to provide quick answers to the questions being raised by what generally are considered the most complex arms - control talks ever attempted .
So far , no ally has complained openly , preserving the impression that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> is in line with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> position that a quick agreement bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> conventional forces down to parity with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> is the West 's top bargaining priority .
But even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> negotiators have <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only 10 months</ENAMEX> left under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> timetable , they are still wrestling over such seemingly fundamental questions as `` What is a tank ? ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> categories of weapons under negotiation have n't even been defined .
Tanks currently are defined as armored vehicles weighing <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 tons</ENAMEX> or more that carry large guns .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> complicated the issue by offering to include light tanks , which are <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as light as 10 tons</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oleg A. Grinevsky</ENAMEX> , the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> negotiator in the conventional - arms talks , argued that this would mean the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> would have to destroy <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 1,800</ENAMEX> tanks , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> would lose none because it has no light tanks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> .
But the issue is stickier than it seems .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> all have light tanks they would like to keep out of the talks .
And some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Army</ENAMEX> analysts worry that the proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> redefinition is aimed at blocking the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> from developing lighter , more transportable , high - technology tanks .
Defining combat aircraft is even tougher .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> insisted that aircraft be brought into the talks , then argued for exempting <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 4,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> planes because they are `` solely defensive . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> has n't budged from its insistence that any gun - carrying plane has offensive capability .
The dispute over that issue , according to one <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> official , is a `` potential treaty stopper , '' and only President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> may be able to resolve it .
Accounting problems raise more knotty issues .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> , for example , are suspected of overstating their arsenals in hopes that they can emerge from the arms - reduction treaty with large remaining forces to deter each other .
Other nations are n't sure how many weapons they have in their own arsenals .
`` It 's just going to be sloppy , both on our side and theirs -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Warsaw Pact 's</ENAMEX> -RCB- , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> analyst .
So far , neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration nor arms - control experts in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time to thrash out than President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has allowed .
They argue that the bigger danger would be that the West would delay action so long that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> might back away from the current conciliatory attitude .
`` So what if you miss <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> tanks somewhere ? '' asks Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Dicks</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wash.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> group that visited the talks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX> .
`` The bottom line is that if we can get that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">-LCB- Warsaw Pact -RCB-</ENAMEX> superiority brought down to parity , we ought to keep pressing ahead as quickly as possible .
I worry more about things becoming so unraveled on the other side that they might become unable to negotiate .
