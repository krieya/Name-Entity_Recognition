<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Motorola</ENAMEX> is fighting back against junk mail .
So much of the stuff poured into its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> , offices that its mail rooms there simply stopped delivering it .
Now , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of mailers , catalogs and sales pitches go straight into the trash .
`` We just do n't have the staff to -LCB- deliver -RCB- it , nor do we have the space or the time , '' says a spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Schaumburg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ill.</ENAMEX> , electronics company , which has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</ENAMEX> employees in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austin</ENAMEX> area .
`` It 's the overload problem and the weight problem we have . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Motorola</ENAMEX> is in good company .
Businesses across the country are getting fed up with junk mail , and some are saying they just are n't going to take it anymore -- literally .
While no one has tracked how many company mail rooms throw out junk mail , direct - mail advertising firms say the number is growing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Motors</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> said it would n't deliver bulk mail or free magazines in its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flint</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , office , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Air Products -AMP- Chemicals</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Allentown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , says it screens junk mail and often throws out most of a given mass mailing .
Why the revolt ?
Anybody with a mailbox can answer that : sheer , overwhelming , mind - numbing volume .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Direct Marketing Association</ENAMEX> , total direct mail -- to both businesses and consumers -- jumped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">65.4 billion</ENAMEX> pieces in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years earlier</ENAMEX> .
Though direct mail to businesses is n't broken out separately , the association says it 's growing even faster .
The deluge has spurred cost - conscious companies to action , with mail rooms throwing the stuff out rather than taking the time or money to deliver it .
The direct - mail industry , not surprisingly , is fuming at the injustice of it all .
After all , this is the industry that has a hard enough time getting any respect , that is the butt of so many jokes that television 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">L.A. Law</ENAMEX> '' portrays direct - mail - mogul <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> as short , bald , intensely nerdy , and unremittingly boring .
The practice of businesses throwing out junk mail `` is a commonly known problem , and it 's increasing as companies attempt to put through budget cuts across the board , '' right down to the mail - room level , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Belth</ENAMEX> , a list consultant and chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Direct Marketing Association 's</ENAMEX> business - to - business council .
`` But it 's like biting the hand that feeds them , because every one of these companies uses direct marketing . ''
It 's almost impossible to track the number of companies trashing junk mail , since the decision is usually made in the mail room -- not the board room .
And the practice often varies from location to location even within a company .
But industry executives say businesses seem especially inclined to dump mailers sent to titles rather than to individual names .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Motorola</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austin</ENAMEX> operation was one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> to lose patience , deciding <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</ENAMEX> to junk any bulk mail that was n't addressed to an individual .
Magazines are n't delivered at all , even if an individual 's name is listed ; employees who want their magazines have to pick them up from the mail room or the company library -- and are told to change the subscriptions to their home addresses .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Air Products</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , the mailroom staff opens junk mail and often throws it away -- even if addressed to an individual .
`` If they get <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> packets of something , they open one , see what it says , throw <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">48</ENAMEX> away and send <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> to people or departments they think are appropriate , '' a spokesman says .
Direct marketers were especially alarmed when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Motors</ENAMEX> -- one of the country 's largest companies and a big direct - mail user itself -- entered the junk - mail battle .
As of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1</ENAMEX> , its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flint</ENAMEX> office , with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,500</ENAMEX> employees , stopped delivering bulk mail and non-subscription magazines .
Employees were told that if they really wanted the publications , they would have to have them sent home instead .
The reason : overload , especially of non-subscription magazines .
Direct - mail executives see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> 's stand as an ominous sign -- even if the junk - mail kings did bring it on themselves .
`` Why anyone would want to close themselves off -LCB- from direct mail -RCB- , a priori , does n't make any sense , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Bronner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bronner Slosberg Associates</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> directmail firm .
`` It smacks of big brotherism .
They 're going to decide what their employees can or can not read . ''
The practice is , however , legal in most cases .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Ellis</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> postal inspector in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Postal Service 's</ENAMEX> only job is to deliver the mail to the mail room ; once it gets there , a company can do with it what it wishes .
The junk - mail titans , ever optimistic , are looking for ways around the problem .
So far , they say , it has n't had any noticeable effect on response rates .
And before it does , they 're trying to cut back on the clutter that created the situation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> place .
Among other things , the industry is trying to come up with standardized business lists that cut down on duplications .
`` We 're going to have to mail a lot less and a lot smarter , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Miller</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Quill Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lincolnshire</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ill.</ENAMEX> , business - to - business mail - order company .
But then again , mailing less and smarter wo n't be much help if the mail ends up in the garbage anyway .
