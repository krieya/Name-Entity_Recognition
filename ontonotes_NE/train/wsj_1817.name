The space shuttle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlantis</ENAMEX> boosted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> spacecraft on its way to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> , giving a big lift as well to an ambitious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> program of space exploration .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Seven years late</ENAMEX> in the launching , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> over budget and a target of anti-nuclear protestors , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> has long been a symbol of trouble for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlantis</ENAMEX> rumbled into a patch of clear sky above <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> with storm clouds closing in on it , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> sought to turn <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> into a symbol of triumph .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> did it right ; that 's the message , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.R. Thompson</ENAMEX> , the agency 's deputy administrator .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.4 billion</ENAMEX> robot spacecraft faces a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - year</ENAMEX> journey to explore <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</ENAMEX> known moons .
If all goes well , it will parachute a probe into the dense <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jovian</ENAMEX> atmosphere in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1995</ENAMEX> to pick up detailed data about gases that may be similar to the material from which the solar system was formed <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.6 billion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> is so enormous -- its mass is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">318</ENAMEX> times that of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> -- that its gravity may have trapped these primordial gases and never let them escape .
Investigating <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> in detail may provide clues to what astronomer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tobias Owen</ENAMEX> calls the `` cosmic paradox '' of life : <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> and other bodies in the outer solar system are rich in elements such as hydrogen that are essential for life on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> , but these planets are lifeless ; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> , on the other hand , has a diminished store of such material but is rich in life .
Some scientists have suggested that comets and asteroids may have brought enough of this kind of material from the outer solar system to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> to spawn life .
Beginning in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1995</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> will begin a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> tour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jovian</ENAMEX> moons .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Voyager</ENAMEX> spacecraft sent back stunning photos of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jovian</ENAMEX> moons <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Io</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europa</ENAMEX> that showed them to be among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system .
The photos showed active geysers on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Io</ENAMEX> spewing sulfurous material <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">190 miles</ENAMEX> into its atmosphere and indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europa</ENAMEX> may have an ocean hidden under a thick sheet of ice .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> 's photos of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europa</ENAMEX> will be <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,000</ENAMEX> times as sharp as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Voyager</ENAMEX> 's , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrence Johnson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> 's project scientist , and may show whether it actually has the only known ocean other than those on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlantis</ENAMEX> lifted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> from the launch pad at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">12:54 p.m. EDT</ENAMEX> and released the craft from its cargo bay <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">about six hours later</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> is on its way to another world in the hands of the best flight controllers in this world , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlantis</ENAMEX> Commander <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Williams</ENAMEX> said .
`` Fly safely . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> - member <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlantis</ENAMEX> crew will conduct several experiments , including growing plants and processing polymeric materials in space , before their scheduled landing at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Edwards Air Force Base</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> project started in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</ENAMEX> , and a number of project veterans were on hand to watch the launch .
An ebullient Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> , wearing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> baseball cap and carrying a camera and binoculars , called the launch `` fantastic . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benny Chin</ENAMEX> , manager of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> probe , compared it to watching a child leave home .
`` I 'm happy and sad , '' he said .
Anti-nuclear activists took a less positive view .
Having argued that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> 's plutonium power source could have released lethal doses of radiation if the shuttle exploded <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , they were n't quieted by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's successful launch .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> will skim past <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> , collecting energy from the planet 's gravitational field to gain momentum for its trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> .
The protesters point out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> also could crash to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> then .
They said they dropped plans to infiltrate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> beefed up its security .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> protest did get past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> 's guard , though ; a computer virus caused <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT" S_OFF="5">anti-Galileo</ENAMEX> messages to flash onto some computer screens at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> centers .
The successful launch continues a remarkable recovery in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> space - science program .
An unmanned spacecraft , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Magellan</ENAMEX> , already is heading to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Venus</ENAMEX> and is due to begin mapping the planet <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next August</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Voyager 2</ENAMEX> sent back spectacular photos of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Neptune</ENAMEX> and its moon , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Triton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Next month</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> plans to launch a satellite to study cosmic rays dating from the birth of the universe .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> , the shuttle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Columbia</ENAMEX> will try to retrieve a satellite that 's been in orbit for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly five years</ENAMEX> measuring the deleterious effects of space on materials and instruments .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Next March</ENAMEX> , the shuttle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Discovery</ENAMEX> will launch the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hubble</ENAMEX> space telescope , a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</ENAMEX> instrument designed to see the faintest galaxies in the universe .
Not all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> 's space - science work will be so auspicious , though .
Around <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Solar Max</ENAMEX> satellite , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> repaired in orbit in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> , will tumble back into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> 's atmosphere .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASA</ENAMEX> wo n't attempt a rescue ; instead , it will try to predict whether any of the rubble will smash to the ground and where .
