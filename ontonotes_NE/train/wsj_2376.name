Just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks , Wall Street suffered another severe attack of nerves .
Does this signal <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">another Black Monday</ENAMEX> is coming ?
Or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity , just like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 19 , 1987 ,</ENAMEX> eventually turned out to be ?
Here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's action , what happens next and what investors should do .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Granville .</ENAMEX>
`` I 'm the only one who said there would be an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> massacre , all through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late August</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Granville</ENAMEX> , once a widely followed market guru and still a well - known newsletter writer .
`` Everyone will tell you that this time is different from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
`` Well , in some ways it is different , but technically it is just the same .
If you 're a technician , you obey the signals .
Right now they 're telling me to get the hell out and stay out .
I see no major support until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2200</ENAMEX> .
I see a possibility of going to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2200</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</ENAMEX> . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Granville</ENAMEX> says he would n't even think of buying until at least <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</ENAMEX> stocks have hit <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">52 - week</ENAMEX> lows ; <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</ENAMEX> stocks hit new lows <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
`` Most people , '' he says , `` have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elaine Garzarelli .</ENAMEX>
A quantitative analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garzarelli</ENAMEX> had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's big drop , she says , `` was not a crash .
This was an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> massacre '' like those that occurred in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</ENAMEX> .
Now , as in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">those two years</ENAMEX> , her stock market indicators are positive .
So she thinks the damage will be short - lived and contained .
`` Those corrections lasted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one to four weeks</ENAMEX> and took the market <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%-12 %</ENAMEX> down , '' she says .
`` This is exactly the same thing , as far as I 'm concerned . ''
Thus , she says , if the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped below <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2450</ENAMEX> , `` It would just be a fluke .
My advice is to buy . ''
As she calculates it , the average stock now sells for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 12.5</ENAMEX> times companies ' earnings .
She says that ratio could climb to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.5</ENAMEX> , given current interest rates , and still be within the range of `` fair value . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ned Davis .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's fall marks the start of a bear market , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ned Davis Research Inc</ENAMEX> .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> , whose views are widely respected by money managers , says he expects no <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> - style crash .
`` There was a unique combination in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
`` Margin debt was at a record high .
There was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds .
The main thing was portfolio insurance , '' a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses . ``
<ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">A hundred billion dollars</ENAMEX> in stock was subject '' to it .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , such selling contributed to a snowball effect .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> could even be <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">an up day</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> says , if major brokerage firms agree to refrain from program trading .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next several months</ENAMEX> , though , he says things look bad .
`` I think the market will be heading down into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
`` We will probably have a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year - end</ENAMEX> rally , and then go down again .
Sort of a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - step bear market . ''
He expects the downturn to carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to around <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2000</ENAMEX> sometime <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
`` That would be a normal bear market , '' he says .
`` I guess that 's my forecast . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon G. Cooperman .</ENAMEX>
`` I do n't think the market is going through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">another October '87</ENAMEX> .
I do n't think that 's the case at all , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cooperman</ENAMEX> , a partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Goldman , Sachs -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> and chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Goldman Sachs Asset Management</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cooperman</ENAMEX> sees this as a good time to pick up bargains , but he does n't think there 's any need to rush .
`` I expect the market to open weaker <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> , but then it should find some stability . ''
He ticks off several major differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">now</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> .
Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , interest rates have been falling <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , the dollar has been strong .
And unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of overheating .
But the economy 's slower growth <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> also means the outlook for corporate profits `` is n't good , '' he says .
`` So it 's a very mixed bag . ''
Thus , he concludes , `` This is not a good environment to be fully invested '' in stocks .
`` If I had come into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios , I would not do any buying .
But we came into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> with a conservative portfolio , so I would look to do some modest buying '' on behalf of clients . ``
We 're going to look for some of the better - known companies that got clocked '' <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kenneth Galbraith .</ENAMEX>
`` This is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent insanity , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galbraith</ENAMEX> , an economist .
`` I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion , '' he says .
`` The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity .
This has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable . ''
Nevertheless , he says a depression does n't appear likely .
`` There is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose , '' he says .
`` It takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thirties</ENAMEX> -- much as the financial community and the government may try . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Gabelli .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> money manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Gabelli</ENAMEX> , an expert at spotting takeover candidates , says that takeovers are n't totally gone .
`` Companies are still going to buy companies around the world , '' he says .
Examples are `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jaguar</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BellSouth</ENAMEX> looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LIN Broadcasting</ENAMEX> . ''
These sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabelli</ENAMEX> figures they will continue .
`` The market was up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</ENAMEX> since -LCB- President -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> took office , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabelli</ENAMEX> says , so a correction was to be expected .
He thinks another crash is `` unlikely , '' and says he was `` nibbling at '' selected stocks during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's plunge .
`` Stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity -LCB- this -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> for guys like me , '' he says .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Rogers .</ENAMEX>
`` It seems to me that this is the pin that has finally pricked the balloon , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers</ENAMEX> , a professor of finance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbia University</ENAMEX> and former co-manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the most successful hedge funds in history , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Quantum Fund</ENAMEX> .
He sees `` economic problems , financial problems '' ahead for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , with a fairly strong possibility of a recession .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> you could n't sell dollars , '' he says .
Dealers `` would give you a quote , but then refuse to make the trade . ''
If the dollar stays weak , he says , that will add to inflationary pressures in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and make it hard for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> to ease interest rates very much .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers</ENAMEX> wo n't decide what to do <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> until he sees how the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> markets go .
He recommends that investors sell takeover - related stocks , but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities , which often do well during periods of economic weakness .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Curzio .</ENAMEX>
Many people now claim to have predicted the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Queens</ENAMEX> newsletter writer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis X. Curzio</ENAMEX> actually did it : He stated in writing in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1987</ENAMEX> that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was likely to decline <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 500</ENAMEX> points <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the following month</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curzio</ENAMEX> says what happens now will depend a good deal on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> .
If it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks , he says , `` That could quiet things down . ''
If not , `` We could go to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2200</ENAMEX> very soon . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank W. Terrizzi .</ENAMEX>
Stock prices `` would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terrizzi</ENAMEX> , president and managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance Investment Management Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> , which manages <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.8 billion</ENAMEX> , drew stiff criticism from many clients <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> because it pulled entirely out of stocks at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the year</ENAMEX> and thus missed a strong rally .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Renaissance</ENAMEX> is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents , primarily <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills .
`` T - bills probably are the right place to be , '' he says .
