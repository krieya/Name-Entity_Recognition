<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this year</ENAMEX> , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> made a final `` take - it - or - leave it '' offer on the minimum wage : an increase to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.25</ENAMEX> an hour over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> , and only if accompanied by a lower wage for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first six months of a job</ENAMEX> .
Now , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> has decided to accept the higher wage over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only two years</ENAMEX> .
The sub-minimum wage would apply only to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> - time teen - age workers for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The White House</ENAMEX> had enough votes to sustain a veto but chose to avoid a confrontation .
The only permanent losers will be the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000 or so</ENAMEX> workers everyone agrees will be priced out of a job at the $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.25</ENAMEX> rate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> is likely to approve <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
It is compromises such as this that convince <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> 's liberals that if they simply stay the course , this administration will stray from its own course on this and other issues .
