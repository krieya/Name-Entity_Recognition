Limbering up after training is very important !
Today team members and I played a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - against - <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> exercise of offensive and defensive technique .
I led Chen Long/Zhou Wenlong in practice .
Since I became a coach , I have had little time to take on the court and play a match with team members because once the coaches step onto the court , the other team members will stop to watch us play and wo n't carry out their training duties very well .
I have n't stepped onto a court for a long time and I thought I might not be able to play a full <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">fifty</ENAMEX> minutes .
Once I started playing , I played fine , hey , and my speed was still pretty good , so when I led them in play together the atmosphere was really good .
I played for <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">fifty</ENAMEX> minutes in <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one</ENAMEX> sitting .
Afterwards when I rested a bit I felt a bit tired and my body also reacted with a lot of aching pain .
But I really enjoyed myself !
After training , you have to remember to limber up !
It is really important .
If you do n't do a good job in limberring up , it will affect your training in the next day !
Power is produced by the contraction of muscle .
After vigorous exercise , muscles will also become excessively tired .
So if you want them to recover , you have to make them regain their elasticity .
We have to help them by putting pressure on the ligaments and make muscles that have contracted too much following vigorous exercise regain their elasticity by stretching them .
This is what we call limbering up .
If you do n't allow your muscles to loosen up and recover each time after training , eventually you will get an injury .
