Bullying , from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> ... facts and observations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Khareq</ENAMEX> .
As an introduction to the topic , I will recount these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> incidents for you :
1- In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Al Sewedi</ENAMEX> district in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> city , I stood in front of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the mosques ,
and I saw <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> residents in a moment of astonishment while a car was leaving the place at a high speed .
When I asked him what had happened , he stated that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> young men had stolen his cell phone and wallet .
I left the place to catch them , and get their license plate numbers .
They had to stop at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the traffic signs , which gets crowded , and they did not notice that I was behind them .
I informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Operations</ENAMEX> of the incident , that they were in front of me at the time , and that there was a security patrol I had seen on the other side of the traffic sign .
But I was shocked when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Operations</ENAMEX> told me , " Do not bother with them .
Go to the police department and report it . "
Oh people , the thieves are in front of me ; inform the patrols about them .
They told me , " It is none of your business . "
I told them , " I will not go to the police department .
This is their car number ; if you want them , chase them .
The car might be stolen . "
And I hung up out of oppression ...
2- On <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the eastern ring road</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> young men in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> car caught my attention .
They were noticeably tense and confused .
On the same road , there was a search point .
I informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Operations</ENAMEX> , and I gave them the car number .
They said there was no report on the car .
I told them , " Inform the search point to check them . "
He said to me , " You want to teach us our job ? "
And they hung up .
After about an hour , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Operations</ENAMEX> called me , and they said , " Brother , do you know where the car went , right or left ?
It turned out to be stolen . "
I laughed the laugh of the oppressed , and I said oh , oh , nation .
-------------------
This is a small part of what is happening now in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> , in general , and what is happening in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> , in particular .
It reminds me of what used to happen in the city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> .
The bullying , depredation , and theft .
But it is notable that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptians</ENAMEX> strongly and very quickly eliminated this practice , and our <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptian</ENAMEX> brothers treated the causes , the most important of which is strengthening the security agency and enforcing police members in the districts and street .
At the same time , they know that the continuation of such actions affect the reputation of the country , in case they continue ; they would eliminate trust in the internal security of the country .
Now , unfortunately , the bullying which was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> , the capital , which has recently witnessed robberies , kidnappings , beatings .... etc.
And we are still only watching what is happening now ; the citizen still faces many problems and robberies .
The thief had some shyness before and fear of the security forces , but now , there is no fear .
They are not ashamed ; <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of them steals in front of everyone and in the morning , even from a policeman , and this happened in fact .
The citizen now , these things which happen now have become normal to him .
He is used to them , because of the negligence of security members and their indifference to what is happening now , their lack of consideration for the complaints of people and their reports , and the insistence of security patrols that it is essential to go to the police departments to report any security violations , though most reports need quick and instant action .
And because of the complications happening now , the chaos about which we hear and see has prevailed .
Unfortunately , these things were weak in the beginning , but they have grown now and reached the level they reached because of security weakness and indecisiveness toward such issues , which have become a daily reality before our eyes .
They happen in our streets , homes , and cars .
If these shameful practices which are happening in our country are not treated decisively , we should expect bigger than them .
The citizen would be forced to own a weapon to protect himself , at the time when the security agencies failed to protect him ...
I am talking here about what is happening in my surroundings and the surroundings of those close to me .
I saw what is happening with my own eyes , so what do you think of a big city like the city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> ?
You hardly enter a gathering or house without hearing horrible stories and tales , and the fear , the fear , is for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> to become an example for criminality like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> ...
So pay attention to your cell phone , wallets , houses , and cars , because the situation has become unbearable .
Some time ago , my car was stolen , and I reported it .
The officer said , " May God not offend you , but search for it with us . "
The funny thing is that I found it myself after only <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</ENAMEX> .
..
As for what is happening in the police departments , we find officers trying to reach reconciliations by all means , because they do not want to tire themselves with an investigation .
The one who commits assault and the victim are equal to him ; if the victim refuses reconciliation , he starts to procrastinate and draw the issue out .
As for the prosecution panel and the general investigation , they protect the gangs and individual criminals , per the system , as they release them from jail on bail without spending a night in it .
The utmost crisis is that the police departments know the locations of criminal gangs .
They know where robberies take place , but indifference spreads in their bodies .
In a short period , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">no more than a month</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</ENAMEX> of my relatives and friends were robbed .
One can measure based on that what is happening in the city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> ...
1- stealing a cell phone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Quds</ENAMEX> district ,
2- stealing a cell phone in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Mecca Markets</ENAMEX> ,
3- stealing a cell phone in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Al Roda</ENAMEX> ,
4- stealing a cell phone on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Hijaz road</ENAMEX> ,
5- robbing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of our employees in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Markab</ENAMEX> district ,
6- assault on a military officer , in his uniform , and taking his cell phone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Markab</ENAMEX> district ,
7- robbing the house of laborers we know and assaulting them ,
8- assaulting a driver and stealing the car ,
9- assaulting a store owner that I know in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mecca Market</ENAMEX> , and stealing the money he had ,
10- stealing the tires of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the neighbors ,
11- robbing his driver 's room .
The situation has become unbearable ...
We are pleading for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">His Highness the Minister of the Interior</ENAMEX> , God protect them , to quickly intervene , to order the increase of the number of security members and security patrols , and to eliminate those practices that give a bad image to our country .

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Ministry of Interior</ENAMEX> is sick and suffers mismanagement , with its corrupt and uneducated personnel , from top to bottom , in all its sectors .
He who has not , gives not .
The defect is in the officials in the sectors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Interior</ENAMEX> , and then its failure in all cities and all sectors is the crisis .
All sectors suffer from a shortage of equipment and supplies , especially the police .
Unemployment is widespread in the society .
Why do n't they hire those young men to fill the shortage , especially when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">the King of the Ministry of the Interior</ENAMEX> , I mean , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">the Minister of the Interior</ENAMEX> , is the one who has been taking on the unemployment issue ?
Why does n't he hire and fill the shortage in his ministry ?
And why is n't the ministry financially supported ?
Imagine , until now , the police still use handwritten correspondence , written in the handwriting of preliminary and primary school graduates by its employees , let alone the low morale of the members , which reflects on their performance .
The citizen in my country will remain without value , inside and outside , unless he has a say in the hiring of officials and a role in holding them accountable .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sami Al Jaber</ENAMEX> .
If public punishments are not applied , the situation will remain the same , and the rest will not be deterred .
- Yes , many are arrested , but where is the punishment ?
-LRB- He who feels secure from punishment misbehaves -RRB- .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Kharek</ENAMEX>
This is a case in which execution was applied among several cases in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why was execution not applied in similar cases ?
And why did the judges stop at imprisonment for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</ENAMEX> and beating for several rape cases in previous incidents ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Saudi News Agency</ENAMEX> :
A capital punishment was carried out yesterday on a criminal in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barida</ENAMEX> city , for committing adultery in a number of incidents .
The following is the text of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of the Interior</ENAMEX> statement in this regard .
God Almighty said : -LRB- The punishment of those who wage war against God and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">His Messenger</ENAMEX> , and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is execution , or crucifixion , or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides , or exile from the land .
That is their disgrace in this world ; a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter . -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali Bin Mohamed Bin Hilan Al Harbi</ENAMEX> lured a number of underage children and raped them by force and against their will .
Thanks to God , the security authorities arrested the mentioned criminal .
Investigation with him led to accusations against him of the commission of his crime .
By referring him to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Public Tribunal</ENAMEX> , a judicial charter was issued convicting him of the act , and he was sentenced to be killed as a punishment .
The verdict was certified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Court of Cassation</ENAMEX> and the permanent panel of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Judicial Council</ENAMEX> .
A supreme order was issued to implement the judicial decision against the criminal mentioned .
The death verdict was implemented against the criminal , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali Bin Mohamed Bin Hilan Al Harbi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday , Wednesday , 12/27/1427 A. H.</ENAMEX> in the city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barida</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Qussaim</ENAMEX> district .
By announcing this , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of the Interior</ENAMEX> is confirming the devotion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques</ENAMEX> ' government , God protect him , to providing security , achieving justice , and implementing the principles of God against anyone who assaults the secure ones in their selves , honor , or money .
At the same time , it is a warning to anyone who considers doing this that judicial punishment will be his destiny .
God is the leader to the good path .

My brother , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Kharek</ENAMEX> , peace , mercy , and the blessings of God be upon you 00 .
You opened a subject on robberies , so we wanted to share in the devotion to God Almighty 0 .
The strangest thing I read was your comment number <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</ENAMEX> -RRB- , quoted from the newspaper . 00
In it , the writer mentions that the nation has advanced criminal equipment and trained cadres . 00
Fine , what is missing that led to the increase of all kinds of crime ?
If the reason is known , the result is clear . 0
The problem is not in the unavailability of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> legislative evidence upon which <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> justice is based ; but rather in a reality in which you live and in which justice is excluded .
The judge 00 is not qualified for the judiciary and is not independent .
This is what deprives the judge of his legitimacy in judging , 0 as he follows the dictations of the prosecutor and others .
The judge receives bribes , recommendations , facilitations , and other things , which do not serve the judiciary , but show it is not independent and impartial . 00
This judiciary has remained like this for a long time .
The accused has been a victim between rivals , until , recently , outside pressure came to support the accused , which has enabled the lawyer .
The lawyer is qualified for positive constitutions that contradict <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> legislation .
This caused the lawyer to use this golden opportunity to release the accused for large amounts of money , estimated at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several million</ENAMEX> in the large criminal cases , which increased the drift of justice . 0
Some judges even quit the judicial profession and turned to legal practice , as he would be a master in the field , since he knows the skills of judges . 00
And we entered the market of crime from there . 0
As for crimes , they are many .
The biggest criminals are known from their looks .
Among them are the organized road robbers , the share robbers , the land and property robbers .
Even dead robbers have appeared , who steal dead bodies .
It is weird .
Thieves are immune to justice .
They even are the justice in our stinky time . 0
As for the agencies , they are developing , and I expect a day will come when the guard will be a thief and and and 00
By using a rational mind and transparent logic , young men who are unemployed , lost , and lazy , raised on the channels that feed and develop them for free , and have a masters degree from the international university of the lost , need a daily allowance of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 - 70</ENAMEX> to dress , eat , and travel around with a limousine , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> per trip .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">southern</ENAMEX> guy gets lost in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> .
They collect a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</ENAMEX> for him and tell him go look for a job ; <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">550</ENAMEX> went to tickets , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifty</ENAMEX> for the trip from the airport to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Batha</ENAMEX> to rent a room in which to sleep , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> .
He wakes up , buys application files , and photocopies his identification .
He spreads them everywhere possible until they are hanging from the bridges .
His daily expenses are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> , with food and beverages , say <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> .
He returns to the hotel to lie down , his face exhausted from the heat , the fatigue , the insults , the name calling , the expulsions , and the humiliation .
Then , he wakes up on his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> day and lingers around his acquaintances , knowing that they despise him for his position , and they say , " We swear to God so - and - so has left , and you can do nothing but return to your home and come back <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next summer</ENAMEX> when the institutes open , " and and %pw and go .
I went back to the hotel , and he said give me a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</ENAMEX> .
I told him I do not have enough money to return .
I am broke , and I have nothing but my identification .
Take it as a guarantee .
I went back home as an unknown with a copy of the identification ; I spent a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> on the road to pass , and all who saw me empty - pocketed said stop in your place .
And we returned after a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> , having eaten the remaining pickings in restaurants until the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Indians</ENAMEX> sent us away . 0
This is about the job . 00
As for the land , you either wait for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years</ENAMEX> if you are lucky and feed the belly of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">the Land Department Director</ENAMEX> with a sheep , honey , or something he considers good , in order to get it after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty - five years</ENAMEX> of feeding him . 0
Or else you go to a planner who tells you that the selling starts on such - and - such date , and the price of a place , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty</ENAMEX> , is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250000</ENAMEX> .
If you do not have it , pay <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5000</ENAMEX> as a down payment and pay the rest in installments of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3000</ENAMEX> every month , with a total value , calculated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sudanese</ENAMEX> man , and who knows about his math , of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450000</ENAMEX> , for the heirs to pay .
And if you are an installment late , you have no right to anything .
I said , fine , let me see the land , so we went .
We found the land close to the relatives , and it was stolen from the group . 000
Then , our unemployed brother faced a look of inferiority from those around him .
He feels inferior and wanders around .
He meets a companion from the same path and the same suffering .
Here starts the thinking and the change of his compass .
When he sees the luxuries around him , he will move and think .
The door is open , the experiences are available , and the elimination of humiliation and takedown is available .
So he starts with a small theft , then a big one , then a variety . 000
If you look , who are actually <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudis</ENAMEX> ?
They are foreigners and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Bangladeshis</ENAMEX> , in particular , who are assigned in their residency to their fathers , the big officials of the nation , in his mother 's name and his father 's name , and they were released in the market like a shark .
They took everything .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">A Royal Decree</ENAMEX> was issued , called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">-LRB- the Reverse Decree -RRB-</ENAMEX> , which prohibits foreigners from working in vegetable sales .
The young people were happy .
They went to the market , and there he was the Bangladeshi controller .
There they were , like for the petroleum .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Bangladeshi</ENAMEX> does not accept <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than ten thousand</ENAMEX> a month . 00
We are in a night , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kharek</ENAMEX> , that has no morning .
Orders are neglected , the phoenix is burnt , misery prevails , and no one is responsible for anyone .
0 .
Our unemployed brother is the small criminal , the lured one .
He is like the old saying would indicate , -LRB- If you have a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">penny</ENAMEX> , you are worth a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">penny</ENAMEX> ; if you do not have a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">penny</ENAMEX> , 00000 You know the rest . -RRB- 00
This is reality , my dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Kharek</ENAMEX> .
I wish there was independent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> legislation in which no one interferes .
And I wish there were an impartial independent general prosecutor to represent national , intellectual , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> security .
If this is achieved , security , prosperity , and freedom would be achieved , and the age of oppression would end .
Calls to prayer and no one hears you , so you wo n't upset your God , even if your back was beaten , and your money was taken .
00000
If nothing changes and we sleep and wake up on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Qassebi and Turki Al Ahmad roads</ENAMEX> ,
and the corrupt gangs like them to whom the mission of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Islam</ENAMEX> was handed 0.
0000
I swear to God , I get astonished , I thank God , and I say , thank You God , that there are still traits and values to praise . 00
And if you say something , say peaceful things , they are good , though their mentalities are unique and their wills are strong . 0
We are a people most intimidated should a missile or heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 - ton</ENAMEX> bombs fall near us .
Around it , we shall sink into the ground for a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> , and then we come out worried .
Do not count on us as weapons , when we are cowards who learned in the schools of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Walid Ibn Talal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibn Ibrahim</ENAMEX> , and full cream , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saleh</ENAMEX> .
This is our university , so do not blame us and do not count on us . 0
The weapon is a cartoon , and the aggression is at the door . 000
Would you explain to us our reality , that we live in this world , and who represents us inside and outside ? 0
Or else what we see is that we are performing a realistic play under commercial stickers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bouri and Khori council</ENAMEX> , who represents his pocket , his interests , and his position . 0
Living became a trade in livestock . 0
Explain to us , the people , what is the meaning of a people ? What is the meaning of gangs ? And what is the meaning of criminals ?
People are confused . 0
==============================
And thank you my brother , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Kharek</ENAMEX> .
I hope to publish it if we can .
Maybe we can regain credibility of presentation and honesty in the message .
What we see today in the forum is nothing but fights between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Baseer Bahrani</ENAMEX> party and people who burn , hide , and mask .
Where are the words of truth ?
Whenever you see a criminal they have caught , you say punish him and , and , and , and , as if he is not a human who lives among us .
We feel for him , because he is the victim of big criminals of the %pw . 00
If he was backed up by a financial or incorporeal support , he would have been honest and would have been propagated as the most honest . 0
The country in reality is a Mafia country of all types and colors .
And the means of criminality were provided by our rational country , until the criminals became holders of scientific and mechanical degrees .
