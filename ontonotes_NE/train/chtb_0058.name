<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qichen Qian</ENAMEX> said that we were always fully confident of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> prospects .
The central government and the people of the whole country always gave strong backing to the special region 's government and the compatriots of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qichen Qian</ENAMEX> also made a comment on the fact that beginning this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> authorities continued to practice the so - called " practical diplomacy " , advocated that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> was a so - called " independent sovereign state " , and actively set up obstacles in the negotiations between both sides of the straits .

We hope <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> authorities conform to the historical development trends , and take opportunities to make active responses and wise choices for political negotiations between both sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Straits</ENAMEX> .
