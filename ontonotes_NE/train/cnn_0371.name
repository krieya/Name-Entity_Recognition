Well , their <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</ENAMEX> on top of the world brought them <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</ENAMEX> of fame .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Hillary</ENAMEX> being named an honorary citizen of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX> , to mark his historic climb to the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mt. Everest</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherpa Norgay</ENAMEX> .
There is concern climbing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Everest</ENAMEX> has become too common , and perhaps a bit too commercial .
I do n't think we have that .
We do n't have anything to demonstrate that commercialality .
All right , let 's show you a little bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mt. Everest</ENAMEX> , the highest summit on the planet .
Some 3D imagery .
There , you see , the big picture of the southern part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> .
We 'll bring you down into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Himilayas</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 million years ago</ENAMEX> , they were formed when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> broke off what was then a piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> and slammed into that portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> , creating this tremendous mountain range , with of course <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mt. Everest</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">29,000 feet</ENAMEX> above sea level .
The highest peak of them all .
This 3D animation kind of exaggerates it a little bit .
What I should tell you is there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 15</ENAMEX> possible routes to get you to the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mt. Everest</ENAMEX> .
What Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Hillary</ENAMEX> did and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norgay</ENAMEX> did was go along this route that takes them across this valley --
You have to turn the picture this way a little bit , shoot back over this range , and bring you up in here .
Then I 'll try to give you my best guesstimation .
Basically , right along this ridge line <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to 29,000 feet</ENAMEX> , into thin air , as it was popularly coined by the book by the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Crack Cower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</ENAMEX> .
Since that , a lot of people have tried , a lot of people have succeeded .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</ENAMEX> people have died trying to reach the summit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Mt. Everest</ENAMEX> .
We 're joined by our guest -- where is our guest , by the way ? who is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kathmandu</ENAMEX> .
And how 's the party going there ?
Are you there ?
