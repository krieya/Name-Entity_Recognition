A breakthrough in the investigation of the terrorist attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole</ENAMEX> . ''
More on that from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Miklaszewski</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pentagon</ENAMEX> with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC News</ENAMEX> exclusive for us .

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> , in a major development senior <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials tell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC News</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> authorities are holding <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> suspects believed directly involved in the attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole ''</ENAMEX> and that at least <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the suspects is `` key to the operation , and talking his head off . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials report the suspect is providing explicit details how the attack was planned for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a year</ENAMEX> then executed with deadly precision , how <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> safe house and the suicide boat used in the attack were acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> before the attack , that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> other suspects , an explosives expert believed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> , and another perhaps a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> , supervised the operation then left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> before the bombing .
The suspect also claims they got help from low - level <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> officials in forging documents , obtaining vehicles , and concealing their operation , but there 's apparently no evidence the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> government itself was involved .
Now , despite all of this , sources say the suspect still has n't named those behind the terrorist operation but with this breakthrough , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials are increasingly confident they 'll soon know who specifically gave the orders to attack the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> . ''
Thank you very much , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Miklaszewski</ENAMEX> , who will be staying on this story for us .
