The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time since early <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> , casting a solid <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">382</ENAMEX> - 37 vote for a compromise measure backed by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> .
The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor .
Advocates said the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">90 - cent</ENAMEX> - an - hour rise , to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.25</ENAMEX> an hour by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1991</ENAMEX> , is too small for the working poor , while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</ENAMEX> of jobs .
But the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> leaders in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> , after congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise .
So both sides accepted the compromise , which would lead to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> lifting of the minimum wage since a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - year</ENAMEX> law was enacted in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</ENAMEX> , raising the wage to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.35</ENAMEX> an hour from $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.65</ENAMEX> .
Under the measure passed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , the minimum wage would rise to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.80</ENAMEX> next <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it .
`` There are no smiles about this bill , '' Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Williams</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont</ENAMEX> . -RRB- said during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> floor debate <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
But `` because it 's all we 've got , I 'm going to vote for it . ''
While the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> the average <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> manufacturing wage , the level of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.25</ENAMEX> an hour in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> will still be less than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</ENAMEX> of average factory pay , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> said .
But Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marge Roukema</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J</ENAMEX> . -RRB- instead praised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> 's acceptance of a new youth `` training '' wage , a subminimum that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> administrations have sought for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</ENAMEX> .
Adopting a training - wage policy means `` getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage , '' Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roukema</ENAMEX> said .
Policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage , but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force .
Labor unions and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> long fought the idea , but recently acceded to it in the face of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration insistence .
The compromise sets the training wage at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.35</ENAMEX> an hour next <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April</ENAMEX> , and at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.61</ENAMEX> an hour , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</ENAMEX> of the minimum wage , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1991</ENAMEX> .
Employers can pay the subminimum for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</ENAMEX> , without restriction , to workers with less than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</ENAMEX> of job experience , and for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">another 90 days</ENAMEX> if the company uses a government - certified training program for the young workers .
The training wage covers only workers who are <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">16 to 19 years old</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The White House</ENAMEX> previously insisted on an unrestricted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The U.S. Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> , still opposed to any mininum - wage increase , said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 %</ENAMEX> in two stages <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">between April 1990 and April 1991</ENAMEX> `` will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> workers and higher prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> consumers .
