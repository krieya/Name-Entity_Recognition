<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> conferees agreed to continue production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grumman Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F - 14</ENAMEX> and to provide more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.8 billion</ENAMEX> for the Strategic Defense Initiative during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the current fiscal year</ENAMEX> .
Industry officials and congressional aides said that the main points of a compromise defense authorization bill , hammered out during a flurry of private meetings over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few days</ENAMEX> , provide a face - saving compromise for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> .
Although conferees are still putting the finishing touches on the package , the final agreement could be announced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as tomorrow</ENAMEX> .
An announcement is more likely <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> , though .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and other supporters of SDI will be able to take credit for blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> efforts to significantly cut the program to develop a space - based antimissile system , which already has cost <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 17 billion</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate Armed Services Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Nunn</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga .</ENAMEX> -RRB- and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> conferees have opposed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> cuts , stalling for almost <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</ENAMEX> action on a number of big - ticket items in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> 's budget .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> voted to authorize <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.5 billion</ENAMEX> for SDI spending in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the current fiscal year</ENAMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> , reflecting a dramatic erosion of support for the program , earmarked <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 3.1 billion</ENAMEX> .
Despite the widening gap between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides , conferees eventually followed the pattern set in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">previous years</ENAMEX> by opting to roughly split the difference .
That would hold spending on the program at about <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year 's</ENAMEX> level .
The decision to keep the embattled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F - 14</ENAMEX> 's production line running for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at least another year</ENAMEX> is an important victory for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> , and especially for Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Aspin</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wis .</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
As the head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> conferees , Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aspin</ENAMEX> has been under intense pressure from his colleagues to reject <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> provisions that would have abruptly cut further <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F - 14</ENAMEX> production .
The package `` provides a temporary , golden parachute for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grumman</ENAMEX> , '' according to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> congressional aide familiar with the closed - door bargaining .
But as part of the overall agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grumman</ENAMEX> and its outspoken supporters on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> effectively will be precluded from reopening the emotional issue in the debate over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year 's</ENAMEX> budget .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney</ENAMEX> and most senators contend that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F - 14</ENAMEX> is too expensive in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">an era</ENAMEX> of shrinking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> budgets .
But the plane boasts a strong core of support in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> , where members are intent on saving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grumman</ENAMEX> jobs and are worried about potential shortages of carrier - based aircraft by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1990s</ENAMEX> .
Conferees also agreed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> requests to earmark a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 1 billion</ENAMEX> for work on both mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Midgetman</ENAMEX> nuclear missiles , according to congressional aides .
And lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on a compromise that would give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Air Force</ENAMEX> nearly all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.4 billion</ENAMEX> it wants for production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Northrop Corp. 's</ENAMEX> radar - eluding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B - 2</ENAMEX> bombers , which cost <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 530 million</ENAMEX> apiece .
The final <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B - 2</ENAMEX> agreement is certain to require detailed testing and verification of the bomber 's capabilities , but congressional aides said the accord wo n't include a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - passed provision that would have withheld production funds until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> approves a cheaper , scaled - down version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70 billion</ENAMEX> fleet of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">132</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B - 2s</ENAMEX> envisioned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> .
