The admiral reviewing the actions of the captain and crew of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole ''</ENAMEX> is recommending no punishment for the ship 's commander .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> sources tell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CNN</ENAMEX> Admiral <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Natter</ENAMEX> 's decision must still be approved by two top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> officials , but the recommendation makes it unlikely the ship 's commanding officer will face any disciplinary action .
The admiral concluded Commander <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kirk Lippold</ENAMEX> 's actions , while not perfect , fell within the `` acceptable '' range of conduct .
The `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> '' was attacked <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> by suicide bombers in a small boat .
