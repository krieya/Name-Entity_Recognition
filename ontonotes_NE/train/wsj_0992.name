Regarding your <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">page - one</ENAMEX> article `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bad Blood</ENAMEX> '' on the generic - drug battle : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Epilepsy Institute</ENAMEX> is not just a patient - advocacy organization .
It is primarily a certified outpatient treatment facility providing comprehensive services to people with epilepsy and their families .
The institute 's advocacy efforts are based on the needs of the population it serves and represents .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Medical Tribune</ENAMEX> reported that a growing number of critics are challenging the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FDA</ENAMEX> bioequivalence - therapeutic - equivalence equation .
`` They contend it is based on an assumption that has not yet been proven in valid tests , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tribune</ENAMEX> said .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> , some institute patients were reporting breakthrough seizures when they were switched from a specific brand - name medication to a generic one or from one generic manufacturer of a specific product to another .
In addition , neurologists were beginning to report these observations as well .
Call it anecdotal if you will .
But no ethical physician would switch patients who were doing well on a specific medication from a specific manufacturer to prove a point .
We do not depend on pharmaceutical companies for our support .
The institute has governmental service contracts for the provision of direct patient services ; collects patient fees ; receives money through contributions from individuals , foundations and bequests .
The funds received from pharmaceutical firms are used to offset physician symposiums , and these symposiums do not stress any particular medication or manufacturer .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Epilepsy Institute 's</ENAMEX> reporting of breakthrough seizures stemmed from concerns about the people we treat and care <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about daily</ENAMEX> .
This perhaps was perceived as a `` bold '' stance , and thus suspicious .
But let us not confuse profits of big business masquerading as concerns for people 's health care or for the cost .
For whom is the saving ?
Surely not to people with epilepsy who depend on the same levels of medication in their bloodstream <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> to maintain seizure control .
