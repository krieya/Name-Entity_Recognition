In addition , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> Part B premium to cover the cost of the new program of insurance against catastrophic illness will rise to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.90</ENAMEX> a month from $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4</ENAMEX> , if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> does n't change the program .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> has voted to repeal most of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Catastrophic Coverage Act</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , however , which would end the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> catastrophic - care premium , as well as an unpopular income surtax paid by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40 %</ENAMEX> of the wealthier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Medicare</ENAMEX> beneficiaries .
Under a less - sweeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> plan , the catastrophic - care <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> premium would continue , rising to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.90</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> , but the surtax would be abolished .

<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">The Catastrophic Coverage Act</ENAMEX> would add a stop - loss provision <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> to limit the maximum beneficiaries must pay for doctors .
Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> bills to reduce the cost and coverage of the catastrophic - care plan would eliminate the cap on doctor 's bills .
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> prevails in its efforts to kill the catastrophic - care plan , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> Part B premium will be $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">29</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> plan prevails , the premium will be $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">33.90</ENAMEX> , with the additional $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.90</ENAMEX> going to pay for expanded hospital coverage under Part A of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Medicare</ENAMEX> .
Most of Part A 's costs are paid by a payroll tax on workers and employers .
