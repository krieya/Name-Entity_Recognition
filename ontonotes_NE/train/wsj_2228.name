In an attempt to give new momentum to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">European Community</ENAMEX> plans for a single currency , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on amending the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> 's founding <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty of Rome</ENAMEX> .
According to diplomatic sources in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brussels</ENAMEX> , most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> leaders agree that talks should begin in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half of 1990</ENAMEX> , and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Strasbourg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> , on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 8</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">9</ENAMEX> .
The only strong opposition to changing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> treaty comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> , who is opposed to creating a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> currency .
But the process of convening the intergovernmental conference does n't require unanimity .
Setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself , but could be viewed as an important psychological push .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francois Mitterrand</ENAMEX> fought to set a date for the conference during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> summit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last June</ENAMEX> , but the move was scuttled because of opposition by Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> Chancellor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX> .
Diplomatic sources said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kohl</ENAMEX> may now agree to set a date for the conference to make it clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> is still committed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> unity .
