<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Immunex Corp.</ENAMEX> said its scientists isolated a molecule which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune - system , ranging from organ - transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma .
The molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the interleukin - 4 receptor .
IL - 4 is a hormone which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the body 's immune response .
The IL - 4 receptor on the surface of such cells receives the hormone 's message to rally the body 's defense .
But in certain conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies and transplant rejection , doctors would like to damp the immune response so such cells do n't touch off harmful inflammatory reactions or cell destruction .
A soluble form of the receptor might turn off a specific part of the immune response without general immune suppression , the company said .
The IL - 4 receptor is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> such receptors to be developed and tested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Receptech Corp.</ENAMEX> , a spinoff of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Immunex</ENAMEX> , through a proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</ENAMEX> initial public offering .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Immunex</ENAMEX> will contract with the spinoff to provide the research , development and initial testing of the new agents .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Immunex</ENAMEX> will have the option to buy back <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Receptech</ENAMEX> shares after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> .
