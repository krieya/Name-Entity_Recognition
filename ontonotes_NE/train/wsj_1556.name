Price wars between the fast - food giants are starting to clobber the fast - food little guys : the franchisees .
`` When elephants start fighting , ants get killed , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray Riese</ENAMEX> , co-owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Restaurants</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> franchisee for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pizza Hut</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Roy Rogers</ENAMEX> and other chains .
As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> area after another , franchisers are struggling desperately for market share , slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions .
The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast - food chains and their franchisees .
The chains `` used to offer discounts during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</ENAMEX> when business was slow , but in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last year or so</ENAMEX> , discounting has become a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">12 - month</ENAMEX> thing , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Harty</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Charisma Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> franchisee of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Grand Metropolitan PLC 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Burger King</ENAMEX> chain .
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Charisma</ENAMEX> 's sales are up slightly <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harty</ENAMEX> says profits will be flat or lower .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Konopnicki</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Safford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ariz.</ENAMEX> , licensee of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald 's Corp.</ENAMEX> who is chairman of the company 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Operators Advisory Board</ENAMEX> , says some fast - food outlets `` could be in serious trouble , based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on . ''
Until recently , the huge fast - food industry , with sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 60.1 billion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , kept price - skirmishing to a minimum .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early this year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PepsiCo Inc. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taco Bell</ENAMEX> unit and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wendy 's International Inc.</ENAMEX> slashed prices and stepped up promotions , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Rohs</ENAMEX> , an analyst for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wertheim Schroder -AMP- Co</ENAMEX> .
That brought a chain reaction in the industry .
The situation was further aggravated <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early this month</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald 's</ENAMEX> set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons .
It also decided to go national with pizza , which it has been test - marketing .
Now , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - for - one deals on pizza are common ; so are <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">99 - cent</ENAMEX> specials on sandwiches normally priced twice as high .
The discounting , say fast - food operators , occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before .
The result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even , laying off middle managers and working harder to make less .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Mack</ENAMEX> , a district manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cormack Enterprises Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Burger King</ENAMEX> operator in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omaha</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neb.</ENAMEX> , says discounting is so prevalent that `` we have to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % to 20 %</ENAMEX> more customers '' to keep sales level .
`` It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food , '' he says .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan D'Agosto</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Panda 's Inc.</ENAMEX> , an operator of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Arby 's</ENAMEX> restaurants in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omaha</ENAMEX> , says : `` All we 're doing is keeping the customers coming , but we are n't increasing sales . ''
With fast - food outlets on every corner , he , like many , does n't think he has a choice in the price war : `` Our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast - food store unless they get a coupon . ''
If the battle continues much longer , many fast - food businesses will close or merge , predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Morrissey</ENAMEX> , who owns a string of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> stores in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Midwest</ENAMEX> .
`` The industry is overbuilt , '' he says .
`` Fast - food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The National Restaurant Association</ENAMEX> says quick - service restaurant units in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131,146</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1983 and 1987</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last year</ENAMEX> for which figures are available .
With the market so crowded , says a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wendy 's</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , `` If you 're doing well , you 're doing well at someone else 's expense . ''
Simply put , there is n't enough business for every store to grow .
According to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rohs</ENAMEX> , inflation - adjusted , same - store sales at company - owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wendy</ENAMEX> 's units in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> have trailed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year - earlier</ENAMEX> levels throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> , except for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald 's</ENAMEX> has also been running negative <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</ENAMEX> , '' the analyst says .
Spokesmen for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wendy 's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald 's</ENAMEX> criticized Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rohs</ENAMEX> 's calculations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Greenberg</ENAMEX> , executive vice president and chief financial officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald 's</ENAMEX> , says the company does n't compute , much less disclose , inflation - adjusted , same - store sales .
He adds that short - term comparisons `` can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> . ''
Profit margins at company - owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald</ENAMEX> 's outlets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> `` are holding up quite nicely , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> .
Profits of franchisees have n't been higher since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1970s</ENAMEX> , he adds .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> 's sanguine outlook is n't matched by many fast - food industry observers .
Smaller chains and single - store operators will be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> to fail , many in the industry predict .
Big franchise groups `` can ride out the storm a lot longer , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harty</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Burger King</ENAMEX> operator in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrissey</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> franchisee , notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties , or portion of sales , that they must pay franchisers .
Franchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a franchiser 's discounting .
But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program , the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lew Rudnick</ENAMEX> , a principal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rudnick -AMP- Wolfe</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> law firm with franchise industry clients .
He says courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing .
In any case , many franchisees , in order to stay on good terms with franchisers , routinely go along with promotions .
Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riese</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Restaurants</ENAMEX> : `` If you resisted on prices , maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise .
