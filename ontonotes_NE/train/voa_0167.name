<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The United States</ENAMEX> says it may invite <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> negotiators to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> as part of efforts to resume <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mid East</ENAMEX> peace negotiations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State Department</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Boucher</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> is exploring the possibility of hosting direct talks between negotiators to build a bridge back to the peace process .
A senior <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> official added that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides agree , the talks could take place in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of next week</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> commitment follows a surprise meeting between <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shlomo Ben - Ami</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> negotiator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilead Share</ENAMEX> left the meeting saying an agreement is still possible .
It is still our assessment that such an agreement is possible within the framework of what we call in a generic name , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Camp David</ENAMEX> .
Under this notion we do assess that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> leadership understand and realize now , that this is a fair , just and reasonable set of ideas that could well be considered as a framework for a permanent status .
The bid for talks was followed by more violence .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> forces killed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least six</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> during a number of clashes <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
