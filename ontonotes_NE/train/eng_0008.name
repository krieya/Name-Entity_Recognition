Learning from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Swedes</ENAMEX>
Reader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Jackson</ENAMEX> calls attention to an article in today 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> about the experiment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockholm</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX> , with congestion pricing .
It seems that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Swedes</ENAMEX> , for all their skill in urban planning and their investments in mass transit , are suffering from traffic congestion .
Better yet , they 're adopting a market - driven remedy .
Socialist though they may be , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX> 's politicians apparently have a firmer grasp of economics than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> 's .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Greater Stockholm</ENAMEX> region has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly two million</ENAMEX> people .
The central city , built upon an archipelago of islands linked by bridges , is particularly prone to congestion .
Under contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> , the national government has set up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</ENAMEX> tolling points which , used in conjunction with transponder boxes , laser detectors and cameras , tracks the path of every car in the city .
Each time a car with a transponder passes through a toll , the charge is automatically deducted from the driver 's bank account .
Tolls vary at different times of the day according to the level of congestion , ranging from the equivalent of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.38</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.76</ENAMEX> per hour .
The goal was to alter motorist behavior -- and that 's exactly what has happened .
Rather than drive to and from work at the same time every day , some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Stockholmites</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Stockholmers</ENAMEX> ? -RRB- are varying their commuting times .
Some are taking different routes .
Some are riding bicycles .
And many are availing themselves of mass transit .
As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WSJ</ENAMEX> explains : Before the trial began , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockholm</ENAMEX> spent <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 180 million</ENAMEX> on improvements to public transportation .
It bought about <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</ENAMEX> new buses and added rush - hour trains , express bus routes and more park - and - ride lots .
But the changes had little impact on the number of people who left their private cars at home .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">spring 2006</ENAMEX> , however , during the trial , use of all forms of public transportation jumped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</ENAMEX> and ridership on inner - city bus routes rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> , compared with a year earlier .
Now that the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> trial has ended , the city has scheduled a referendum to let voters decide whether to make the congestion - pricing scheme permanent .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> poll found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52 percent</ENAMEX> of voters favored the plan .
So far , the idea of congestion pricing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> has n't gotten past the talking stage .
Oh yeah -- a system that tracks every car 's movements through transponders will go over with the public in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va</ENAMEX> .
There remain people who wo n't buy smarttags because they do n't want Big Brother to have the data -LRB- or their spouse 's divorce lawyer . -RRB-
It strikes me as remarkable that our transportation policies are more socialistic than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX> 's .
We wo n't do photo red , and you are suggesting this ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anonymous</ENAMEX> , I do n't believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Swedish</ENAMEX> system requires people to install transponders .
Some people will prefer that option because it 's more convenient .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WaPo</ENAMEX> ran the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> story on D 5 of Business .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anonymous 11:06</ENAMEX> see our comment yesterday re anonymity .
Citizens can have functional transport , functional settlement patterns , functional governance and a sustainable civilization ;
Or they can , to protect cheating husbands and wives and others for whom secrecty is a way to preserve special privilage , obsess over private rights to the exclusion of public responsibilities .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">EMR</ENAMEX>
By all accounts the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockholm</ENAMEX> experiment has been a success , so far .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> issues come to mind .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockholm</ENAMEX> spent <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 180 million</ENAMEX> on transportation improvements before the experiment .
Would the experiment have been as successful if they had not spent the money ?
Was the `` success '' a manufactured result to cover up for the previously failed investment ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockholm</ENAMEX> had the presence of mind and the fairness of government to put this together as an experiment , and allow the citizens to dismantle it later if they thought it not worthwhile .
That is an admirable approach ,
what <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">US</ENAMEX> government has ever incorporated a policy as a test and THEN put it up for referendum ?
One of our problems is that having made a mistake , it is impossible to get the government to own up to it .
Where is the referendum on whether we should spend <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">umpteen billion</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Tyson</ENAMEX> 's project ?
Focus groups and special interests do n't count .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</ENAMEX> , granted , the government in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockholm</ENAMEX> has every incentive to spin this in a good light ,
and all the reviews seem good .
I 'm suspicious when no one seems to be able to find any shortcomings .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> , it took quite some time for the economic effects to sort themselves out and be measured .
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> experiment also seems to be a success , there is considerable movement against it and the rapid rise in tolling charges that followed .
It does not seem likely that it will be repeated in other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">English</ENAMEX> cities .
For the record , I 'm in favor of congestion tolling , but I also think it will hasten the de-emphasis of central areas .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> there seems to be a distinct decrease in business just inside the edge of the congestion zone and a distinct increase just outside .
It is too soon to see what happens in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockholm</ENAMEX> ,
but the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">stockholm</ENAMEX> is a lot different from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> is another example of effective use of congestion pricing .
I 'm not usre that there 's much about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> 's governmental philosophy that we should emulate -LRB- thinly disguised <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - party rule -RRB- but , as someone who has spent a great deal of time there over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 20 years</ENAMEX> , I can testify that traffic in the center city is much improved without any indication that economic development has been curtailed .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Southern California</ENAMEX> , there are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</ENAMEX> tollways with variable pricing that fluctuates with traffic density .
The highway design is configured to give drivers options about whether to pay the higher rates or get off the road .
Seems to work .
re : congestion pricing and `` edge '' impacts .
simple - move the boundaries ... :--RRB-
further , let 's think outside the box here .
what makes `` congestion pricing '' - WORK ?
It 's electronic tolling .
`` congestion pricing '' is but <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</ENAMEX> of possible outcomes based on the underlying technology .
The privacy aspects are undeniable but the momentum towards electronic tolling is also .
Right now .. they can `` track '' you with your cell phone and your credit card as well as red - light cameras and even security cameras in businesses .
Electronic Tolling will make possible other methods of collecting revenue from vehicular travel besides congestion pricing .
Obviously new roads / expanded / improved roads will also be possible - roads that we currently have no money for and unlikely to have money for in the near future .
Electronic Tolls present an opportunity to build new roads shortly after the study / decision is made - vice waiting for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> .. and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VDOT</ENAMEX> 's case <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</ENAMEX> .
The primary difference between this country and other countries ' use of electronic tolling is that we 're still thinking of individual roads whereas those other countries are implementing electronic tolling for the REGION - as a way to SHAPE the entire network 's congestion .
So .. think in terms of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">NoVa</ENAMEX> area with a connecting network of electronically tolled roads being priced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</ENAMEX> ... and the place much like cell phone minutes .
You have to admit - the cell phone business model does <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> things very , very well .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , you pay for when / where and do n't get a free ride
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> , the cell companies collect enough in revenues to keep building more cell towers and expand coverage .
think about the same model with roads and electronic tolling .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> , the cell phone analogy is brilliant .
That is the logic of where the technology will take us -- if only politics do n't stand in the way .
Either <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nova Scout</ENAMEX> is right or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> is right .
Congestion pricing does n't seem to have limited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> 's economic activity , but how would you know ?
For <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing , it 's like traffic congestion :
the demand is so high that even if you build new roads or throttle the demand , it is still high .
For another , If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> is right and congestion pricing has shaped the region , then some of that economic activity is not happening where it might have otherwise .
Transportation is very closey connected with economic activity .
So in that sense , what tolling does is impose a tax on profits that have not yet been made .
I think you should tax only income and sales , but I suppose you could rationalize this as a sales tax on use of the roads .
I still think there is no reason to institute tolling except in special circumstances : Expensive bridges , and highly congested zones , for example .
Otherwise a gas tax set high enough to do its job is still a fairer and cheaper method , and more environmentally friendly :
the infrastructure is in place , and it automatically taxes by distance , weight , and horsepower .
The cell phone analogy is far from brilliant .
There are multiple cell phone companies -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Verizon Wireless</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cingular</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sprint</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TMobile</ENAMEX> , etc. -RRB- .
There is only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> medieval and corrupt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Assembly</ENAMEX> .
And their goal was , is and will remain the transfer of wealth from the economically successful -LRB- and congetsed -RRB- areas to those areas of the state locked in the economic practices of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid 1800s</ENAMEX> .
This will not end until <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Dillon Rule</ENAMEX> is discarded in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northern Virginia</ENAMEX> forms a separate state .
Congestion `` pricing '' = congestion `` taxation '' .
If you want to continue the cell phone analogy then <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> ought to have a chance to propose their approach to traffic management using <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northern Virginia 's</ENAMEX> taxes as a competitive alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the General Assembly 's</ENAMEX> proposal .
The people of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northern Virginia</ENAMEX> -LRB- i.e. the buyers of the product offered under congestion `` pricing '' -RRB- would then have a choice - like they do today with cell phone service .
Until there is choice , this is just another method of perpetuating the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northern Virginia</ENAMEX> subsidy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">southern Virginia</ENAMEX> welfare state .
No thanks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groveton</ENAMEX> , You 're missing the point of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> 's post regarding the cell phone model :
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , you pay for when / where and do n't get a free ride
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> , the cell companies collect enough in revenues to keep building more cell towers and expand coverage . ''
How does the presence of absence of competition affect either of those <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> attributes ?
As for the `` Medieval corrupt '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Assembly</ENAMEX> , do n't forget which region of the state sends more senators and delegates to that body than any other .
As we 've discussed elsewhere on this blog , the transfer of wealth between regions is accounted for primarily by the `` Standards of Quality '' funding formula that redistributes resources from affluent school systems to poor school systems , and secondarily by road - funding formulas that favor rural areas .
Your criticisms should be directed to those <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> particular funding formulas , not to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the `` General Assembly ''</ENAMEX> as a whole .
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northern Virginia 's</ENAMEX> gripes over these funding formulas could be shared by the affluent suburbs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richmond</ENAMEX> area --
but you do n't hear <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richmond</ENAMEX> suburbanites fantasizing about seceding from the state .
-LRB- For the record : I live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Henrico County</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Some Northern Virginians</ENAMEX> want it both ways .
They 're entirely happy with the arrangement that divests it from any responsibility for the `` inner city '' of e <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington , D.C.</ENAMEX> , and all those icky poor people ,
and they would like to divest itself from responsibility for outlying rural areas as well .
In other words , these people advocate cherry picking the most affluent suburban jurisdictions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">NoVa</ENAMEX> , creating a separate political entity for themselves and insulating themselves from the urban and rural poor .
A gated community on a regional scale !
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> , is n't that what congestion pricing does , place a toll gate on the community ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX> , congestion pricing uses the pricing mechanism to allocate scarce roadway capacity .
If you want to call that `` placing a toll gate on the community , '' I suppose you can .
