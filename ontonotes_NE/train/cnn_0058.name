The investigation into the bombing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole ''</ENAMEX> is turning up new leads <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</ENAMEX> , but the identities of the culprits remain unknown .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Rodgers</ENAMEX> reports .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> fishing boat passes the crippled destroyer `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> '' .
With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">no Coast Guard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,000 miles</ENAMEX> of coastline , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> appears to have been an ideal location to strike an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> warship in port to refuel .
Historically boats get in and out of these waters easily .
There is is a long tradition of smuggling here and privately <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials do not believe the attack on the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> '' was hatched in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> , but elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> world .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> divers are still working the waters trying to recover clues .
They are , according to sources , looking for the body parts of those who pilotted a small boat into the port side of the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> '' nearly sinking it .
I will tell you we are a long way from any conclusions , a long way from preliminary conclusions .
There are a lot of rumors going around , speculation going around , but there have been no conclusions yet .
<ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About six miles</ENAMEX> from the crippled `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> '' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> investigators have pitched tents instant crime labs along the boat ramp from which the suicide attack was launched .
At the house where the explosive device was believed to have been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> agents have removed a great deal of evidence .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> police also believe they have found <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> other locations in this neighborhood also used by the bombers .
So far , the investigation is still limited to this port city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> official said the numbers of those detained or being questioned is now in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> figures .
It 's still way too early to talk about <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> retaliation for the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> '' , because it 's still not known who to retaliate against .
In the words of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> senior official here `` no one has ever seen an operation quite like this before . ''
