<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Panelli</ENAMEX> had a perfectly good reason for not using the $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">300</ENAMEX> rowing machine he bought <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</ENAMEX> .
`` I ate a bad tuna sandwich , got food poisoning and had to have a shot in my shoulder , '' he says , making it too painful to row .
The soreness , he admits , went away <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week</ENAMEX> after the shot .
Yet the rowing machine has n't been touched since , even though he has moved it across the country with him twice .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> lawyer , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panelli</ENAMEX> rowed religiously when he <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> got the machine , but , he complains , it left grease marks on his carpet , `` and it was boring .
It 's a horrible machine , actually .
I 'm ashamed I own the stupid thing . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panelli</ENAMEX> has plenty of company .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly three - fourths</ENAMEX> of the people who own home exercise equipment do n't use it as much as they planned , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Wall Street Journal 's</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American Way of Buying</ENAMEX> '' survey .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Roper Organization</ENAMEX> , which conducted the survey , said <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half</ENAMEX> of the exercise equipment owners found it duller than they expected .
It is n't just exercise gear that is n't getting a good workout .
The fitness craze itself has gone soft , the survey found .
Fewer people said they were working up a sweat with such activities as jogging , tennis , swimming and aerobics .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</ENAMEX> of those surveyed said they simply walk <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> for exercise .
That 's good news for marketers of walking shoes .
The survey also detected a bit more interest in golf , a positive sign for country clubs and golf club makers .
The survey 's findings certainly are n't encouraging for marketers of health - club memberships , tennis rackets and home exercise equipment , but people 's good intentions , if not their actions , are keeping sales of some fitness products healthy .
For instance , sales of treadmills , exercise bikes , stair climbers and the like are expected to rise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.52 billion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Sporting Goods Association</ENAMEX> , which sees the home market as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the hottest growth areas for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</ENAMEX> .
But even that group knows some people do n't use their machines as much as they should .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> excuse is they do n't have enough time , '' says research director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Doyle</ENAMEX> .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> is they do n't have enough discipline . ''
With <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 15 million</ENAMEX> exercise bikes sold in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five years</ENAMEX> , he adds , `` a lot of garages , basements and attics must be populated with them . ''
Still , the average price of such bikes rose <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">145</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doyle</ENAMEX> predicts a trend toward fewer pieces of home exercise equipment being sold at higher prices .
Electronic gimmicks are key .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Premark International Inc.</ENAMEX> , for example , peddles <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the M8.7sp Electronic Cycling Simulator</ENAMEX> , a $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,000</ENAMEX> stationary cycle .
On a video screen , riders can see <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> different `` rides , '' including urban , mountain and desert scenes , and check how many calories are burned a minute .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Igdaloff</ENAMEX> , who works in corporate payments at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bank of America</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , may be a good prospect for such a gizmo .
She 's trying to sell a $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">150</ENAMEX> exercise bike she bought <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about five years ago</ENAMEX> for her roommate .
But rather than write off home fitness equipment , she traded up : Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igdaloff</ENAMEX> just paid <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 900</ENAMEX> for a fancier stationary bike , with a timer , dials showing average and maximum speeds and a comfortable seat that feels almost like a chair .
`` I 'm using it a lot , '' she says .
`` I spent so much money that if I look at it , and I 'm not on it , I feel guilty . ''
The poll points up some inconsistencies between what people say and what they do .
A surprising <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78 %</ENAMEX> of people said they exercise regularly , up from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> .
This conjures up images of a nation full of trim , muscular folks , and suggests couch potatoes are out of season .
Of course , that is n't really the case .
The discrepancy may be because asking people about their fitness regime is a bit like inquiring about their love life .
They 're bound to exaggerate .
`` People say they swim , and that may mean they 've been to the beach <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krys Spain</ENAMEX> , research specialist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's hard to know if people are responding truthfully .
People are too embarrassed to say they have n't done anything . ''
While she applauds the fact that more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> are getting up from the television to stroll or garden , she says the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> who do `` real exercise to build the heart '' is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10 % to 20 %</ENAMEX> .
So many people fudge on answers about exercise , the president 's council now uses specific criteria to determine what is considered vigorous : It must produce contractions of large muscle groups , must achieve <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> of maximum aerobic capacity and must be done <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> or more times a week for a minimum of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of the council 's goals , set in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> , was to see more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> of adults <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">under 65 years of age</ENAMEX> getting vigorous exercise by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> .
That target has been revised to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2000</ENAMEX> .
But even that goal may prove optimistic .
Of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</ENAMEX> activities , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> survey found that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> -- including bicycling , skiing and swimming -- are being done by fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years ago</ENAMEX> .
Time pressures and the ebb of the fitness fad are cited as reasons for the decline .
Only walking and golf increased in popularity during the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980s</ENAMEX> -- and only slightly .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeanette Traverso</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> lawyer , gave up running <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> times a week to play a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> round of golf , finding it more social and serene .
It 's an activity she feels she can do for life , and by pulling a golf cart , she still gets a good workout .
`` I 'm really wiped out after walking <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five hours</ENAMEX> , '' she says .
Most people said they exercise both for health and enjoyment .
`` If you sit down all the time , you 'll go stiff , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce Hagood</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Roxboro</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.C.</ENAMEX> , homemaker who walks <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several miles</ENAMEX> a week .
`` And it 's relaxing .
Sometimes , if you have a headache , you can go out and walk it right off . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only about a quarter</ENAMEX> of the respondents said they exercise to lose weight .
Slightly more , like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie Sherren</ENAMEX> , a law librarian in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> who attends dance aerobics <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> times a week , exercise to relieve stress .
`` Working with lawyers , '' she says , `` I need it . ''
But fully <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 %</ENAMEX> of those polled felt they did n't need to belong to a health club .
`` They 're too crowded , and everybody 's showing off , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Bryant</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">22 - year - old</ENAMEX> student from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pasadena</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif</ENAMEX> .
`` The guys are being macho , and the girls are walking around in little things .
They 're not there to work out . ''
But at least they show up .
Nearly half of those who joined health clubs said they did n't use their membership as often as they planned .
Feeling they should devote more time to their families or their jobs , many yuppies are skipping their once - sacred workout .
Even so , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Association of Quality Clubs</ENAMEX> , a health - club trade group in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> , says membership revenues will rise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion</ENAMEX> .
A spokeswoman adds , however , that the group is considering offering `` a behavior - modification course , similar to a smoking - cessation program , to teach people ways to stay with it . ''
There are die - hard bodies , of course .
The proprietor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sante West</ENAMEX> , an aerobics studio in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Marina district</ENAMEX> , which was hit hard by the earthquake , says , `` People were going nuts <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the minute</ENAMEX> we opened , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</ENAMEX> after the quake .
`` The emotional aspect is so draining , they needed a good workout . ''
Perhaps the most disturbing finding is that the bowling alley may be an endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> institution .
The survey reported the number of people who said they bowl regularly has fallen to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 8 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The American Bowling Congress</ENAMEX> claims a higher percentage of the public bowls regularly , but concedes its membership has declined <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this decade</ENAMEX> .
To find out why , the group recently commissioned a study of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 20 years</ENAMEX> of bowling - related research .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> reasons were pinpointed : a preference for watching bowling and other sports on television rather than actually bowling , dowdy bowling centers , and dissatisfaction with bowling itself .
People who start bowling expecting it to be a pleasurable exercise `` have been generally disappointed , '' the report said .
But not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Cottrell</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> cab driver who bowls in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> leagues .
He hit the lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</ENAMEX> on the advice of his doctor .
`` It 's good exercise , '' he says .
`` I ca n't do anything score-wise , but I like meeting the girls . ''
He says bowling helps him shed pounds , though that effort is sometimes thwarted by the fact that `` when I 'm drinking , I bowl better . ''
His <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> team , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Leftovers</ENAMEX> , is in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> place .
