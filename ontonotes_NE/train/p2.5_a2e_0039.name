Many confusing questions have been taxing my mind for years about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and its people .
Are they really as miserable as we see them , or are our eyes deceiving us ?
Are the horrible statistics we read on the unemployment rates and the dangerous diseases that consume the liver , kidneys , and the entire body of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptian</ENAMEX> real , or a fabrication of the nice governor ?
Is the waste of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> 's wealth from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventies</ENAMEX> until today a reality , or an illusion ?
How did <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> 's production of long - fiber cotton , the best in the world , drop from <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 million tons</ENAMEX> to just <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four tons</ENAMEX> ?
How was almost all the public sector sold , and where is its price ?
How did the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptian</ENAMEX> become the cheapest human being on the surface of the earth ?
Is this reasonable ?
Can we believe all this and believe at the same time that the people are still silent ?
What are these <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptian</ENAMEX> people ?
How are they ?
How do they think ?
Why are they silent ?
Are they that cowardly ?
I do not stray far from the truth if I say that I have read a lot in sociology , from the Introduction of its founder , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibn Khaldoun</ENAMEX> , passing by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gamal Hemdan</ENAMEX> -LRB- the best man to describe <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> lately -RRB- , to the last student in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the sociology department</ENAMEX> - the university of the poor , who are injured with knives and sticks and surrounded by the gangs of national sadness .
Not all that has been written of course , but what concerns us in guarded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> -LRB- I do not know where this guarding is ?! -RRB- , because I want to understand the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptian</ENAMEX> personality , and why it is silent in spite of all its suffering from injustice , suppression , starvation , and humiliation , and , of course , all this was accompanied by stops at our ancient and modern history .
