After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> of quarreling over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bonn</ENAMEX> 's `` Ostpolitik '' , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> appear to have shifted onto a united course in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bonn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> have taken a leading role in aid for the reformist countries , pledging <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</ENAMEX> in fresh credit and forgiving old debt while urging other industrial nations to follow suit .
Both hope to encourage pressure for change in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East bloc</ENAMEX> countries still ruled by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Stalinist</ENAMEX> holdouts by arranging liberal financial aid and trade benefits for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> and , to a lesser extent , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> officials also have the special goal of holding out hope for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany 's</ENAMEX> fledgling reform movement .
`` The change taking place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> has aroused new hope in both <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> states that reforms will be undertaken in -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX> -RCB- , and that relations between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> states , too , will get better , '' said Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans - Dietrich Genscher</ENAMEX> .
Addressing a conference of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Institute for East - West Security Studies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genscher</ENAMEX> said , `` History will judge us by whether we have taken the opportunities that emerge from these reforms . ''
The ultimate aim of Western support for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East bloc</ENAMEX> reforms , he said , is to create `` an equitable and stable peaceful order in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Atlantic</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Urals</ENAMEX> . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genscher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> Secretary of Commerce <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert A. Mosbacher</ENAMEX> , in separate speeches at the conference , appealed for more Western contributions to economic reforms and business development in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bonn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> are leading supporters of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> 's request for a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> stand - by credit from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> .
`` We want the bold programs of market development and political freedom in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> to succeed .
We are prepared to support those changes , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mosbacher</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> curbs on the exports of sensitive technology to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East bloc</ENAMEX> countries will remain in place , however .
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. House of Representatives</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> approved an <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 837.5 million</ENAMEX> aid package for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> that more than doubles the amount President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> had requested .
The package was brought to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">just 15 days</ENAMEX> after it was introduced , indicating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> 's eagerness to reward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> for their moves toward democracy and freemarket economic reforms .
The legislation , approved <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">345</ENAMEX> - 47 and sent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> , establishes <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> enterprise funds , to be governed by independent nonprofit boards , which will make loans and investments in new business ventures in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Polish</ENAMEX> fund would be seeded with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 160 million</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hungarian</ENAMEX> fund with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</ENAMEX> .
In addition , a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</ENAMEX> industrialized countries , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and coordinated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Community Commission</ENAMEX> , has promised <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> trade advice and a line of credit equivalent to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.11 billion</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Investment Bank</ENAMEX> , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> plans <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 222 million</ENAMEX> in direct aid .
When Chancellor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX> travels to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 9</ENAMEX> , he is expected to take with him a promise of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">three billion West German marks</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6 billion</ENAMEX> -RRB- in new credit guarantees for industrial projects .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bonn</ENAMEX> agreed to reschedule <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5 billion marks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Polish</ENAMEX> debt that came due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
In addition , a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">one billion mark</ENAMEX> credit dating from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</ENAMEX> is to be written off .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> 's plan to switch to a free - market economy by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> is hampered by a foreign debt load of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 39.2 billion</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> also has increased its credit guarantees to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">500 million marks</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5 billion marks</ENAMEX> as the emerging democratic state rushes through its own economic reforms , including a broad privatization of state - owned industry and tax incentives for industrial investment .
<ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">An additional 500 million marks</ENAMEX> in credit - backing was promised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> state governments of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bavaria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baden - Wuerttemberg</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Deutsche Bank AG</ENAMEX> , which <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> arranged a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">three billion mark</ENAMEX> credit for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , is now moving to become the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> bank to set up independent business offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> as they shift to free - market economies .
A maxim of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> banking holds that wherever <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Deutsche Bank</ENAMEX> goes , other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> banks follow .
Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</ENAMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> banks are believed to be making inquiries .
