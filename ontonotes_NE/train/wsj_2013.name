When Maj. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moises Giroldi</ENAMEX> , the leader of the abortive coup in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> , was buried , his body bore several gunshot wounds , a cracked skull and broken legs and ribs .
They were the signature of his adversary , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Panamanian</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Antonio Noriega</ENAMEX> .
The rebel officer 's slow and painful death , at the headquarters of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Battalion - 2000</ENAMEX> squad , was personally supervised by Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , says a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> official with access to intelligence reports .
Leaping into rages , sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> has put to death <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 70</ENAMEX> of his troops involved in the coup , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama City</ENAMEX> .
He is now changing the place he sleeps <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</ENAMEX> , sometimes more than once a night .
His meals are most often prepared by women he trusts -- his full - time mistress , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vicky Amado</ENAMEX> , and her mother , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norma</ENAMEX> .
And he is collecting the names of those who telephoned the coup - makers to congratulate them during their brief time in control of his headquarters .
More enemies to be dealt with .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the two weeks</ENAMEX> since the rebellion , which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> hesitantly backed , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> has been at his most brutal - and efficient - in maintaining power .
Yet , while the failed coup is a major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> foreign policy embarrassment , it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> that stretches back <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three decades</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's war on the dictator over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</ENAMEX> , following his indictment on drug charges in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1988</ENAMEX> , is the legacy of that relationship .
Before <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> foreign policy set out to destroy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , it helped create him out of the crucible of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> 's long history of conspirators and pirates .
For most of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 30 years</ENAMEX> , the marriage was one of convenience .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</ENAMEX> , for example , when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was both a cadet at an elite military academy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> and a spy - in - training for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> , he was detained by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lima</ENAMEX> authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Embassy</ENAMEX> cable from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that period</ENAMEX> .
The woman had nearly died .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence , rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy , merely filed the report away .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> interests .
From that point on , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> would make a practice of overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Panamanian</ENAMEX> 's misadventures .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> has befriended and later turned against many dictators , but none quite so resourceful .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">55 - year - old</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> is n't as smooth as the shah of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> , as well - born as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anastasio Somoza</ENAMEX> , as imperial as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand Marcos</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> or as bloody as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haiti</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baby Doc Duvalier</ENAMEX> .
Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them .
And out of necessity : The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power , but a single error on his part could cost him his life .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> underestimated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> all along , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambler Moss</ENAMEX> , a former Ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> .
`` He has mastered the art of survival . ''
In keeping with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's long history of propping up Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , recent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> actions have extended rather than shortened his survival .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> might have fallen of his own weight in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> because of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> 's dire economic situation , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moss</ENAMEX> , but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression , and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement .
`` If the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> had sat back and done nothing , he might not have made it through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moss</ENAMEX> contends .
Perhaps most important , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's allies have intervened to encourage -- in some cases , to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Colombian</ENAMEX> drug boss , upon hearing in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> that Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was negotiating with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> to abandon his command for a comfortable exile , sent him a hand - sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name .
`` He is cornered , '' says the Rev. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernando Guardia</ENAMEX> , who has led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Catholic Church</ENAMEX> opposition against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> have left him without a way out .
It is easy to fight when you do n't have any other option . ''
His chief advantage in the fight : his intimate knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> ways and weaknesses .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the gringos , who have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> discovered the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Noriega</ENAMEX> in late <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</ENAMEX> , when he was in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">his second year</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chorrillos Military Academy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lima</ENAMEX> , according to former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence officials .
The contact occurred through Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's half - brother , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Panamanian</ENAMEX> diplomat based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Carlos</ENAMEX> , knowing that helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> could advance the career of any <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Panamanian</ENAMEX> officer , relayed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony</ENAMEX> 's reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow students and , more important , among his officers and instructors .
A spy was born .
It was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , who was known to his friends as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cara la Pina</ENAMEX> -- pineapple face .
Born the illegitimate son of his father 's maid , he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama City</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> older than most of his fellow cadets , and gained admission to the academy because his brother had falsified his birth certificate .
He considered himself intellectually superior to his <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Peruvian</ENAMEX> peers , many of whom were wayward sons sent by their well - off families to the highly disciplined , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> - modeled academy as a sort of reform school .
In his peaked military cap and neatly pressed , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> - made uniform , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life , friends from the period say .
`` He had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism , where officers were the elite with special privileges , '' recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darien Ayala</ENAMEX> , a fellow student in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> and a lifelong friend .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's relationship to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> intelligence agencies became contractual in either <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</ENAMEX> , intelligence officials say .
His commanding officer at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chiriqui Province</ENAMEX> garrison , Major <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar Torrijos</ENAMEX> , gave him an intriguing assignment : Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> would organize the province 's first intelligence service .
The spy network would serve <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> clients : the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Panamanian</ENAMEX> government , by monitoring political opponents in the region , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , by tracking the growing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communist</ENAMEX> influence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">unions</ENAMEX> organized at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Fruit Co. 's</ENAMEX> banana plantations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bocas del Toros</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Armuelles</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Fruit</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> largest contributors to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> 's national income .
Satisfying its interests was a priority for any <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Panamanian</ENAMEX> leader .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's initial retainer was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 50 to $ 100</ENAMEX> a month , plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PX</ENAMEX> , a former intelligence official says .
It was modest pay by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> standards , but a healthy boost to his small military salary , which fellow officers remember as having been <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 to $ 400</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> .
`` He did it very well , '' recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Martinez</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Panamanian</ENAMEX> colonel who managed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> and his operation .
`` He started building the files that helped him gain power . ''
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Guard</ENAMEX> job assumed by Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</ENAMEX> -- as chief of the transit police in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">David City</ENAMEX> , capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Chiriqui Province</ENAMEX> -- was tailor - made for an aspiring super-spy .
By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information .
He knew which local luminaries had been caught driving drunk , which had been found with their mistresses .
This proved particularly valuable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Panamanian</ENAMEX> government in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</ENAMEX> , when union leaders were planning a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May Day</ENAMEX> march that the government feared could turn violent .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy .
So he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana - exporting city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Armuelles</ENAMEX> , which was ruled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Fruit Co</ENAMEX> .
The campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control .
`` It was like a play on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX> , '' recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martinez</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> managed the whole thing .
He was superb .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people . ''
During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">his years</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chiriqui</ENAMEX> , however , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodrigo Miranda</ENAMEX> , a local lawyer and human - rights monitor , recalls an intoxicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> visiting prisoners in their cells at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">5th Zone Garrison</ENAMEX> headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">David</ENAMEX> , where he had his offices .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked , laughing at them and then retreating to his office .
`` People started wondering if something was wrong with him , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miranda</ENAMEX> recalls .
But through this period , so far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military was concerned , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was a model recruit .
He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> officers at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort Gulick</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1967</ENAMEX> , according to a copy of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</ENAMEX> resume with details Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> has since classified as secret .
He flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Bragg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.C.</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September of that year</ENAMEX> for a course in psychological operations , returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the School of the Americas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - month</ENAMEX> course called `` military intelligence for officers . ''
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty , but they did so falsely .
He rose to chief of intelligence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> 's socalled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">G - 2</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</ENAMEX> after providing populist dictator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrijos</ENAMEX> the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> .
He became Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrijos</ENAMEX> 's inseparable shadow , and the holder of all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> 's secrets .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , by now a lieutenant colonel , expanded his contacts to include the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Cubans</ENAMEX> -- not to mention the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> and any other intelligence service that came knocking .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> diplomats complained to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> of Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's moonlighting , intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> .
`` Early on in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Department</ENAMEX> , we took to calling him the rent - a - colonel , in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> , '' recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis J. McNeil</ENAMEX> , who , as deputy assistant secretary of state for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="6">inter-American</ENAMEX> affairs , first ran across reports about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</ENAMEX> .
`` Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Cubans</ENAMEX> . ''
Even at this early stage , drugs caused additional concerns .
During the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> administration , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Drug Enforcement Administration</ENAMEX> became dismayed at the extent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the G - 2 's</ENAMEX> connections to arrested drug traffickers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DEA</ENAMEX> agent drew up a list of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> options for dealing with Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of which was assassination .
The head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DEA</ENAMEX> at the time , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ingersoll</ENAMEX> , scotched the assassination plan .
But he did fly to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> to scold dictator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrijos</ENAMEX> on the drug ties of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Panamanian</ENAMEX> officials , including Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> later recalled that Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrijos</ENAMEX> seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
`` Everybody was afraid of him , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> says .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> became an even greater threat in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> sergeants working for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Army 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">470th Military Intelligence Group</ENAMEX> .
The tapes included wiretaps of Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrijos</ENAMEX> 's own phone , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> intelligence officials .
`` We caught him with his hands on our cookie jar , '' says former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stansfield Turner</ENAMEX> .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first time</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> considered cutting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> from its intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX> says .
`` In the world of intelligence , if you want to get information , you get it from seedy characters .
The question is how much you get tied in with seedy characters so they can extort you . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intelligence</ENAMEX> officials to this day worry whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> sold sensitive information on the recordings to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Cubans</ENAMEX> or others .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX> was troubled enough to cancel the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> contract with the rent - a - colonel at the beginning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> administration .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> soon found new cause for concern : gun - running .
Prosecutors in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Southern Florida</ENAMEX> indicted <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Panamanians</ENAMEX> on charges of illegally running arms to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sandinista</ENAMEX> rebels trying to overthrow the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> government of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Somoza</ENAMEX> .
They included one of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's closest friends and business partners , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Wittgreen</ENAMEX> .
And the investigators were quickly closing in on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> himself .
At the time , though , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> was once again flirting with its longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Latin American</ENAMEX> spy .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> made plans to fly to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> for a meeting with his counterpart at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dade County</ENAMEX> and federal authorities , learning that he intended to fly through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> , made plans to arrest him on the gun - running charges as soon as he hit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> soil .
It was a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> foiled the plan .
According to military officers at the time , word was passed to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> by his <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> hosts that the police would be waiting .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials received a routine , unclassified message from the military group commander in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> .
`` Due to health reasons , Lt. Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> has elected to postpone his visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , '' it read .
Prosecutors in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> received yet another setback .
Their original indictment against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wittgreen</ENAMEX> , the friend of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other four</ENAMEX> was dismissed on a technicality .
But now , along with reindicting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's pal , they intended to charge Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> himself , on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 2 million</ENAMEX> in arms .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1980</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Sanford</ENAMEX> , as assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney , was summoned to a meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">a Federal Bureau of Investigation</ENAMEX> agent assigned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Panamanian</ENAMEX> dictator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrijos</ENAMEX> , he was told , had granted the shah of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> asylum in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> as a favor to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> was told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's friend , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wittgreen</ENAMEX> , would be handling the shah 's security .
It would n't be a good idea to indict him -- much less Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , the prosecutor was told .
After prodding from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Eskenazi</ENAMEX> pleaded with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justice Department</ENAMEX> officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> to let the indictment proceed .
`` Unfortunately , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eskenazi</ENAMEX> wrote in a letter , `` those of us in law enforcement in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control . ''
The letter , along with a detailed prosecution memo , sat on the desks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justice</ENAMEX> officials for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> before the case died a quiet death .
`` I think if we had been allowed to go ahead then we would n't have the problems we have now , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> says .
`` If he had been found guilty , we could have stopped him . ''
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1983</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> took over as General and de-facto dictator of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> , having maneuvered his way to the top <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only two years</ENAMEX> after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar Torrijos</ENAMEX> .
Soon , the military became a veritable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">mafia</ENAMEX> controlling legal and illegal businesses .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration also put Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">G - 2</ENAMEX> back on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> payroll .
Payments averaged <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 200,000</ENAMEX> a year from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> .
Although working for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was hardly helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> exclusively .
During the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Cubans</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sandinistas</ENAMEX> .
He allegedly entered into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> 's first formal business arrangement with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Colombian</ENAMEX> drug bosses , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Floyd Carlton</ENAMEX> , a pilot who once worked for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> and who testified before the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> grand jury in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> that would ultimately indict the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Panamanian</ENAMEX> on drug charges .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was convinced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> would n't act against him , recalls his close ally <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Blandon</ENAMEX> , because he had an insurance policy : his involvement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Contra</ENAMEX> rebels in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blandon</ENAMEX> says the general allowed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Contras</ENAMEX> to set up a secret training center in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Managua</ENAMEX> .
And on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</ENAMEX> occasion , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring of 1985</ENAMEX> , he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sandinista</ENAMEX> arsenal in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> .
Although , his help for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Contra</ENAMEX> cause was limited , it was enough to win him important protectors in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration , says Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Leahy</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> who then served on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> played <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence agencies and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government like a violin , '' he says .
An incident in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> suggested <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> additional means by which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> might have maintained such influence with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> -- by compromising <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curtin Windsor</ENAMEX> , then the ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> , recalls being invited to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Carlos</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a weekend</ENAMEX> of deep sea fishing and `` quiet , serious conversation '' on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Aswara Peninsula</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windsor</ENAMEX> notified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everett E. Briggs</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> , of the invitation .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briggs</ENAMEX> screamed , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windsor</ENAMEX> recalls .
He says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briggs</ENAMEX> told him he was being set up for a `` honey trap , '' in which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> would try to involve him in an orgy and then record the event `` with sound and video . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briggs</ENAMEX> , on vacation after resigning his position at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Security Council</ENAMEX> , could n't be reached for comment .
As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's political troubles grew , so did his offers of assistance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Contras</ENAMEX> , an apparent attempt to curry more favor in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
For instance , he helped steal the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1984</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Panamanian</ENAMEX> elections for the ruling party .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">just one month later</ENAMEX> , he also contributed $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">100,000</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Contra</ENAMEX> leader , according to documents released for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North 's</ENAMEX> criminal trial in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C</ENAMEX> .
Yet , his political setbacks mounted .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was accused of ordering in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> the beheading of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo Spadafora</ENAMEX> , his most outspoken political opponent and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> man to publicly finger Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> on drug trafficking charges .
He then ousted President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Ardito Barletta</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">World Bank</ENAMEX> official with close ties to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barletta</ENAMEX> tried to create a commission to investigate the murder .
And , all the while , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> 's debt problems continued to grow .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was growing desperate .
In late <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> , he made an offer he thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> could n't refuse .
As recounted in a stipulation that summarized government documents released for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX> trial , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> offered to assassinate the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sandinista</ENAMEX> leadership in exchange `` for a promise to help clean up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's image and a commitment to lift the -LCB- U.S. . -RCB- ban on military sales to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Panamanian Defense Forces</ENAMEX> . ''
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX> , '' the document went on , referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX> , `` has told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's representative that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> law forbade such actions .
The representative responded that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> had numerous assets in place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> and could accomplish many essential things , just as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> had helped -LCB- the U.S. . -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</ENAMEX> in blowing up a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sandinista</ENAMEX> arsenal . ''
Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX> conveyed the request to his superiors and to Assistant Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliot Abrams</ENAMEX> , who relayed it to Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Shultz</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's proposal was turned down .
And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shultz</ENAMEX> curtly told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abrams</ENAMEX> that the general should be told that only he could repair his tarnished image .
The end of the marriage was at hand .
Within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</ENAMEX> the unfolding <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Iran - Contra</ENAMEX> scandal took away Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's insurance policy .
The death of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Casey</ENAMEX> and resignation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX> allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON" S_OFF="5">anti-Noriega</ENAMEX> political forces to gain influence .
Public protests against him were triggered in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1987</ENAMEX> due to charges by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz Herrera</ENAMEX> , his former chief of staff , that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> had stolen the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> election and had ordered the killing of Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spadafora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrijos</ENAMEX> .
Few <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> officials were willing any longer to defend him .
Lawyers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> -- this time working virtually without impediment -- prepared to have him indicted on drug charges in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1988</ENAMEX> .
During negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1988</ENAMEX> over proposals to drop the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> indictments in exchange for his resignation , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> often asked almost plaintively how the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> , whom he had helped for so many <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> , could turn against him .
Now , neither side -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> nor Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> -- has an easy out .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has sworn to bring him to justice .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> believes he has n't any alternative but to continue clutching to power .
It is a knock - out battle -- perhaps to the death .
In the end , is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> the political equivalent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankenstein</ENAMEX> 's monster , created by a well - intentioned but misguided foreign power ?
Not quite , Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leahy</ENAMEX> contends .
`` For short - term gains , people were willing to put up with him .
That allowed him to get stronger and stronger , '' he says .
`` I do n't think we created him as much as we fed him , nurtured him and let him grow up to be big and strong .
