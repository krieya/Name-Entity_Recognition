When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> opened its doors to foreign investors in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</ENAMEX> , toy makers from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> were among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> to march in .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 75 %</ENAMEX> of the companies ' products being made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , the chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toys Council</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Ting</ENAMEX> , has suggested a new sourcing label : `` Made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> Companies . ''
The toy makers were pushed across the border by rising labor and land costs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> colony .
But in the wake of the shootings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 4</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
Although the manufacturers stress that production has n't been affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's political turmoil , they are looking for additional sites .
The toy makers , and their foreign buyers , cite uncertainty about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's economic and political policies .
`` Nobody wants to have all his eggs in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> basket , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Yeh</ENAMEX> , chairman and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Matchbox Group Ltd</ENAMEX> .
Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Matchbox</ENAMEX> and other leading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> toy makers were setting up factories in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> , especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX> , long before the massacre .
Their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
By diversifying supply sources , the toy makers do n't intend to withdraw from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , manufacturers and foreign buyers say .
It would n't be easy to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</ENAMEX> .
A supply of cheap labor and the access to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> port , airport , banks and support industries , such as printing companies , have made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> province a premier manufacturing site .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South China</ENAMEX> is the most competitive source of toys in the world , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Hu</ENAMEX> , executive director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wah Shing Toys Consolidated Ltd</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> trade figures illustrate the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , exports of domestically produced toys and games fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$ 10.05 billion</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 1.29 billion</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
But re-exports , mainly from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , jumped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$ 15.92 billion</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989 's first seven months</ENAMEX> , domestic exports fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29 %</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$ 3.87 billion</ENAMEX> , while re-exports rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 %</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$ 11.28 billion</ENAMEX> .
Manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 120,000</ENAMEX> people are employed by the toy industry .
`` For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few years</ENAMEX> , like it or not , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is going to be the main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">supplier</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Young</ENAMEX> , vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Perfecta Enterprises Ltd.</ENAMEX> , one of the first big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> toy makers to move across the border .
In the meantime , as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites , they are focusing mainly on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> .
Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Matchbox</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wah Shing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kader Industrial Co.</ENAMEX> , the toy manufacturer headed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ting</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Philippines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> also are being studied .
With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Community</ENAMEX> set to remove its internal trade barriers in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> , several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> companies are beginning to consider <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> as possible manufacturing sites .
Worries about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> came just as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> toy industry was recovering from a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> sales slump and bankruptcy filings by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> companies , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Worlds of Wonder Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coleco Industries Inc</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> difficulties chastened the local industry , causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management .
The industry regards <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results .
Still , they long for a `` mega-hit '' toy to excite retail sales in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> biggest market for toys and games .
The closest thing the colony 's companies have to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> mega-hit <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</ENAMEX> series of action figures manufactured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Playmates Holdings Ltd</ENAMEX> .
Introduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1988</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 - centimeter</ENAMEX> - tall plastic turtles are based on an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> comic book and television series .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Kwan</ENAMEX> , managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Playmates</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ninja Turtles</ENAMEX> have been sold , placing the reptilian warriors among the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> biggest - selling toys in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
Should sales continue to be strong through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the Christmas season</ENAMEX> , which accounts for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 60 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> retail toy sales , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kwan</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the Ninja Turtles</ENAMEX> could make <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> a record sales year for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Playmates</ENAMEX> .
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> .
Besides the lack of a fast - selling product , they cite the continued dominance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> market by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nintendo Entertainment System</ENAMEX> , an expensive video game made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nintendo Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nintendo</ENAMEX> buyers have little money left to spend on other products .
Many of the toy makers ' problems started well before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 4</ENAMEX> as a result of overstrained infrastructure and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> 's austerity programs launched <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late last year</ENAMEX> .
Toy makers complain that electricity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> has been provided <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only three days</ENAMEX> a week in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</ENAMEX> , down from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</ENAMEX> a week , as the province 's rapid industrialization has outstripped its generating capacity .
Manufacturers are upgrading standby power plants .
Bank credit for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> investments all but dried up following <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 4</ENAMEX> .
Also , concern exists that the harder - line <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> leadership will tighten its control of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> , which has been the main laboratory for the open - door policy and economic reforms .
But , toy manufacturers and other industrialists say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> will be restrained from tightening controls on export - oriented southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
They say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> .
`` The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kwan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Playmates</ENAMEX> .
