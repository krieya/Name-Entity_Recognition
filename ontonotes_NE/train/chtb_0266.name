<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Xinhua News Agency</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August 31st</ENAMEX> , by reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chengbo Huai</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the " Jerusalem Post "</ENAMEX> quoted the words of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawel</ENAMEX> , director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Administrative Office of the Israeli Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> who is now visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> as saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the World Bank</ENAMEX> has decided to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">250 million US dollars</ENAMEX> of aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Palestinian Autonomous Authorities</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">before the end of 1994</ENAMEX> .
This decision broke the impasse between donor countries and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Palestinian Autonomous Authorities</ENAMEX> that had lasted for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly one year</ENAMEX> .
At the international meeting on aiding <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> autonomy which was held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1st of last year</ENAMEX> , donor countries pledged to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.4 billion US dollars</ENAMEX> of development aid <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">within 5 years</ENAMEX> , of which <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">750 million US dollars</ENAMEX> would be appropriated in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</ENAMEX> .
But donor countries claimed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> autonomous region lacks necessary mechanisms for handling the aid and accounting items and therefore refused to completely fulfill this promise .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawel</ENAMEX> said that although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the World Bank</ENAMEX> are currently not completely satisfied with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> accounting work , they have still agreed to pay a portion of the funds as soon as possible .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Executive Committee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Palestinian Liberation Organization</ENAMEX> , and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> leaders have been criticizing the donor countries for not being able to keep their promise to make sure the money aid is completely in place and on time .
It is predicted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shashe</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PLO</ENAMEX> 's chief negotiations representative , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosechird</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's chief negotiations representative , will go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> to specifically negotiate and determine the aid issues with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the World Bank</ENAMEX> .
