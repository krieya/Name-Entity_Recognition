Now back to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">people in the news</ENAMEX> . ''
Good to be -LRB- bleep -RRB- King .
Reporter :
With the success of a new television show and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Oz-fest</ENAMEX> tour ready to kick off , things were looking great for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozzy Osbourne</ENAMEX> .
He was sober , he was rich and surrounded by a family who loved him but once again , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozzy</ENAMEX> 's high would hit a low .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">That July</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon Osbourne</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozzy</ENAMEX> 's long - time manager , wife and best friend , announced to the world that she 'd been diagnosed with colon cancer .
Every fiber of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozzy</ENAMEX> was shaken .
He had to be sedated for a while .
Reporter :
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon</ENAMEX> would have to undergo rounds of chemotherapy <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">all summer</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozzy</ENAMEX> took time off from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Oz-fest</ENAMEX> to tend to his wife .
Ever the rock , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon</ENAMEX> faced cancer head on .
When you go in there and people so much worse than me , and it 's like , How lucky am I to have a great support system .
Reporter :
Even with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon</ENAMEX> trying to make things as easy as possible on her husband , he was still a mess .
His struggle with sobriety would be tested again .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozzy</ENAMEX> 's not doing too good right now .
Drinking ?
Drinking and he 's very delicate .
He 's , like , dealing with it the best he can .
Reporter :
Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon</ENAMEX> 's illness , it 's business as usual for the family .
Though pushed back , filming commenced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last fall</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> season of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Osbournes</ENAMEX> . ''
Some days when I 'm feeling bad , I say I ca n't do this anymore , and then you wake up and see the crew , and then , you know , you snap out of it .
Reporter :
The larger question loomed .
How could comedy come out of chemotherapy treatments ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon</ENAMEX> is dealing with the diagnosis and illness but what 's interesting is humor is the same .
Reporter :
And the humor did remain the same .
The show came back with a vengeance <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last fall</ENAMEX> chronicling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozzy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon</ENAMEX> dealing with cancer and the kids hoping -- coping with new - found celebrity and one of the top rated shows .
Ratings for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> season slid .
I 'm not banking my whole life on bringing , you know , number <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> rated show .
Having a nervous breakdown .
The bubble will burst .
Reporter :
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</ENAMEX> , more ups and downs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon</ENAMEX> announced in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April</ENAMEX> that the cancer was in remission , but <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">just weeks</ENAMEX> after that announcement , son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> entered drug and alcohol rehabilitation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> .
His family said that his party life style caught up with him .
Now , with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> season set to start , will <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozzy</ENAMEX> 's role as a family man change the image in the annuls of heavy metal mad man ?
I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozzy</ENAMEX> 's the guy that hit a head of a bat , you know ?
Crazy , drug taking , hard drinking , hard living rock n roller .
I think what the show does is also show that you might be those things , but also might be a pretty great dad , too .
I would n't be here now if it was n't for my wife .
I always loved my wife but sometimes I do n't like her and sometimes she does n't like me but we love each other .
I hate these people that go , we 've been married for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">56 years</ENAMEX> and never had a bad word .
They must have been living in a different planet .
Reporter :
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozzy Osbourne 's</ENAMEX> life filled with incredible highs crashing into devastating lows .
A manic life , grounded in family values .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozzy</ENAMEX> 's not going to like me saying this , but he 's a very tender , gentle man .
This is a guy whose world revolves not so much around music as around his wife .
Rock `n roll !
Part of the legacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozzy Osbourne</ENAMEX> is a cautionary tale .
It 's also , you know , tale that includes family love , you know , and a lot of good things .
We have had it .
Reporter :
It 's a tale that continues to unfold .
No telling how long the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osbourne</ENAMEX> phenomenon may last but the family 's loyal following will always be screaming for more .
Stop screaming !
Reporter :
And so will <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozzy</ENAMEX> .
Sharon !
Despite problems --
