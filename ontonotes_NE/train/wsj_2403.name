<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa - Midi Assurances</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> gave details of its financing plans for its proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.5 billion</ENAMEX> acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , in amended filings with insurance regulators in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> states where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> operates .
The proposed acquisition is part of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX> 's unfriendly takeover attempt for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services concern that is parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> .
In an attempt to appease <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> regulators ' concern over a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldsmith</ENAMEX> acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> , Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> agreed to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa</ENAMEX> if he is successful in acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">B.A.T</ENAMEX> .
As part of the agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa</ENAMEX> agreed to invest <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hoylake Investments Ltd.</ENAMEX> , Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> 's acquisition vehicle .
Of the total <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.5 billion</ENAMEX> to be paid to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hoylake</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 billion</ENAMEX> will come from available resources of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa</ENAMEX> 's parent , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa - Midi Group</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.25 billion</ENAMEX> will be in the form of notes issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa</ENAMEX> , and the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.25 billion</ENAMEX> will be in long - term bank loans .
In an interview <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Bebear</ENAMEX> , chairman and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa</ENAMEX> , said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cie . Financiere de Paribas</ENAMEX> that they can provide the loan portion of the financing .
The other banking companies in the group are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Credit Lyonnais</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Societe Generale</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BankAmerica Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citicorp</ENAMEX> , he said .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa - Midi Group</ENAMEX> has `` <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 2.5 billion</ENAMEX> of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell '' to help pay off debt from the acquisition .
He said the assets to be sold would be `` non-insurance '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> .
`` We wo n't put any burden on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hoylake</ENAMEX> has an absolute obligation to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa</ENAMEX> upon an acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">B.A.T</ENAMEX> .
`` We hope that with what we did , the regulators will not need to evaluate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hoylake</ENAMEX> , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hoylake</ENAMEX> wo n't be an owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> at anytime , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> said .
Any change of control in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</ENAMEX> states where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> and its related companies are incorporated .
The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hoylake</ENAMEX> , and to reflect the extension that Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> received <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hoylake</ENAMEX> dropped its initial <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 13.35 billion</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.71 billion</ENAMEX> -RRB- takeover bid after it received the extension , but said it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa</ENAMEX> receives regulatory approval .
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">B.A.T</ENAMEX> said of the amended filings that , `` It would appear that nothing substantive has changed .
The new financing structure is still a very - highly leveraged one , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Axa</ENAMEX> still plans to take out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> ' earnings as dividends to service their debt . ''
That dividend is almost double the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</ENAMEX> currently taken out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">B.A.T</ENAMEX> , the spokesman added .
`` It would have severe implications for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Farmers</ENAMEX> ' policy holders . ''
To fend off Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> 's advances , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">B.A.T</ENAMEX> has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would pare it to a tobacco and financial services concern .
