The long - running scandal surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> collapse of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Banco Ambrosiano</ENAMEX> was reignited by the arrest <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> businessman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flavio Carboni</ENAMEX> on fraud charges .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> magistrates accuse Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carboni</ENAMEX> and several other people of trying to extort <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.2 billion lire</ENAMEX> -LRB- $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">880,000</ENAMEX> -RRB- from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vatican</ENAMEX> in return for documents contained in the briefcase of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberto Calvi</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ambrosiano</ENAMEX> chairman found hanged under <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Blackfriar 's Bridge</ENAMEX> shortly before the bank 's collapse .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Banco Ambrosiano</ENAMEX> , which was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> 's largest private - sector bank , collapsed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</ENAMEX> of debts .
Most of the money was lent to a series of shell companies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Luxembourg</ENAMEX> that were owned , directly or indirectly , by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vatican</ENAMEX> bank .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vatican</ENAMEX> , which denies any wrongdoing , paid <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 million</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> bank 's creditors as a `` goodwill gesture '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> .

<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Italian</ENAMEX> papers speculated the briefcase contained papers either exonerating the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vatican</ENAMEX> bank from blame in the scandal , or showing that the bank , known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Istituto per le Opere di Religione</ENAMEX> , channeled funds to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East bloc</ENAMEX> groups such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Solidarity</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> .
