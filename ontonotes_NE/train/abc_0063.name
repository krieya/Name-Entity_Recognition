When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole ''</ENAMEX> was attacked <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last October</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> sailors were killed , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the sailors on board <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole ''</ENAMEX> used his own camera to record some of the aftermath .
These are pictures you have not seen before , what the terrorists did to a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> ship , not to mention the country 's morale .
Here 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John M Wethy</ENAMEX> .
Most of the sailors who died were about to have lunch .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> - eaten meal still sits on the table .
<ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">A few feet</ENAMEX> away , destruction is total -- the floor driven up through the ceiling , a deadly twisting of steel , daylight showing through a gaping hole in the side of the ship .
We was lucky to make it through all this .
Seaman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Wingate</ENAMEX> , who shot this home video , remembers <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the moment</ENAMEX> , along with his shipmates .
It was a really loud boom .
I mean , it 's almost undescribable how loud it was .
I actually started running up the passageway , up the ladder .
I opened up the door , and there was no deck there .
It 's gone .
I felt my whole body shaking .
I thought I was getting electrocuted .
I did n't know what was going on .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the hours just after the blast</ENAMEX> , the crew is in a state of shock .
Some still covered with soot from the explosion wander through darkened passageways , still not sure what hit them .
God was -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> was with me <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
A senior enlisted man says he would have been killed if he had not been called to a meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">moments</ENAMEX> before the blast .
There was debris laying all over .
Outside , the ship 's exterior walls are pitted by shrapnel from the explosion .
An orange life raft , blown from the deck , is plastered to the side of the bridge , like a moth on the front of a speeding car .
Crewmen , now at battle stations , stand at a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 - caliber</ENAMEX> machine gun that was unmanned when the attack occurred .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> 's final report on the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> '' attack is expected to explain why no one will be punished , even though the captain and crew failed to take basic steps to protect the ship .
Sources say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> itself will accept part of the blame , by admitting all its ships were vulnerable and its sailors were not trained to expect this kind of attack .
