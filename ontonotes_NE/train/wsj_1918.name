Efforts by a federal mediator to reignite talks between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Machinists</ENAMEX> union apparently failed , and no further meetings are scheduled .
Company officials and union representatives did n't meet face to face , but the mediator shuttled between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> groups .
In a statement issued after the meeting , the aerospace giant said it wo n't increase its offer although adjustments within the proposed pay - and - benefit mix are possible .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Machinists</ENAMEX> already have rejected a proposal that called for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</ENAMEX> pay increase and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> bonus in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the second year</ENAMEX> , workers would receive a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</ENAMEX> wage boost and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</ENAMEX> bonus , followed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</ENAMEX> increase without a bonus in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third year</ENAMEX> .
`` The company will not budge on anything , '' said a spokesman for the union .
As the strike enters <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">its 15th day</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , some members are getting nervous , the spokesman conceded , but the majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Machinists</ENAMEX> are prepared to `` wait it out as long as it takes .
