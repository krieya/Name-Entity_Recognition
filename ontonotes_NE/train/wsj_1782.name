Housing construction sank in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> to its lowest level since the last recession , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commerce Department</ENAMEX> reported .
Work began on homes and apartments at an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,263,000</ENAMEX> units <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.2 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , the department said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> decline followed an even steeper drop of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.2 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> and left housing starts at their weakest since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1982</ENAMEX> , when the country was nearing the end of a recession .
Originally the department had reported the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> decline as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> .
The numbers suggest that the housing industry is still suffering the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve 's</ENAMEX> battle against inflation .
The industry had shown signs of recovery <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</ENAMEX> , after the central bank began to relax its clamp on credit , allowing interest rates to drop a bit after pushing them up for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</ENAMEX> .
Sales of new homes rose and inventories of houses , which had been climbing , dropped .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> new construction in all types of homes waned , from single - family houses to large apartment complexes .
`` It 's pretty much weak across the board , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Regalia</ENAMEX> , chief economist of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Council of Savings Institutions</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Regalia</ENAMEX> said the industry may be reluctant to step up building at the moment for fear the inventories of unsold homes will increase again .
Another reason for the weakness , he said , may be that mortgage rates have hit a plateau since they began edging down after a peak in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , rates on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> fixed - rate mortgages started creeping up a bit , but they inched down again through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> .
`` Rates have n't really peeled off that much , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Regalia</ENAMEX> said .
`` We 've kind of settled now into an interest - rate environment that 's fairly high . ''
Work was begun on single family homes -- the core of the housing market -- at an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">971,000</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , a drop of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.1 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous month</ENAMEX> .
That followed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.3 %</ENAMEX> decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> .
Construction of apartments and other multi-family dwellings slipped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.2 %</ENAMEX> to an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,022,000</ENAMEX> following a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5 %</ENAMEX> decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> .
The number of building permits issued for future construction dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.4 %</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,296,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rate after rising <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.7 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> .
All the numbers were adjusted for normal <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</ENAMEX> variations in building activity .
The housing starts numbers , however , are one of the least precise of the government 's economic indicators and are often revised significantly as more information is collected .
