<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">European Community</ENAMEX> employers fear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the EC Commission 's</ENAMEX> plans for a `` charter of fundamental social rights '' is a danger to industrial competitiveness .
`` We do n't want <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brussels</ENAMEX> deciding conditions for workers unless they are necessary and useful , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz</ENAMEX> , secretary general of the employers ' confederation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Unice</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Unice</ENAMEX> -- an acronym for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Union of Industrial and Employers ' Confederations of Europe</ENAMEX> -- fears that the charter will force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> countries to adopt a single pattern in labor relations .
Workers and management , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyszkiewicz</ENAMEX> said , would lose the `` flexibility and diversity '' that has so far allowed them to adapt to local conditions and traditions .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> government also strongly opposes the charter in its current form .
It argues , as does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Unice</ENAMEX> , that labor relations are best left to be regulated at the national level .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> will propose a slightly watered - down version of the charter to be discussed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> social - affairs ministers on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> , officials said .
But the cosmetic changes are n't expected to win over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> .
`` We still have serious differences with the text , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> official said , because it provides for a `` regulation of the labor market . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyszkiewicz</ENAMEX> said the charter would put poorer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> countries such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> at a disadvantage .
It would force these countries to introduce minimum standards for pay and <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">working hours</ENAMEX> , and provide for collective bargaining and worker `` participation '' in major corporate decisions .
This , he warned , would prevent these countries from bridging the difference with their richer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> brethren .
Indeed , lower wages -- in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> , they are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> average -- are n't enough to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries .
Increasing labor costs , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyszkiewicz</ENAMEX> argued , would only put the countries at a further disadvantage in competing in the barrier - free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> market planned for after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Unice</ENAMEX> official said that producing a charter acceptable to both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> industry is n't an unattainable goal .
The charter would just have to be restricted to a list of workers ' fundamental rights , without seeking to impose any norms .
A key provision in the current version of the charter would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">commission</ENAMEX> a mandate to produce an `` action program '' detailing on what points <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> member states would be required to comply with the goals set out in the charter .
This provision lies at the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Unice</ENAMEX> fears of `` social engineering '' by the commission .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> possible political solution , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> official said , would be for the commission to present the action program in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late November</ENAMEX> , before the adoption of the charter at a summit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> governments on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 8 and 9</ENAMEX> .
This would leave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> free to adopt the charter after having rebutted the action program .
The charter was approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the EC Commission</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 21</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Socialist</ENAMEX> government , which currently holds the council 's rotating presidency , is committed to having the charter adopted by all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EC</ENAMEX> states before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 1989</ENAMEX> -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">bicentennial</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the French revolution</ENAMEX> and its `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</ENAMEX> .
