I see .
I think . .
No I have to come back because I do n't think all my stuff will fit in , in our vehicles .
So I have to come back .
But , yeah .
%huh .
it 's a lot of airport shenanigans .
I was really upset .
I did n't know .
%huh ?
I did n't know .
yeah , %uh
It 's not my <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fault</ENAMEX> .
It 's going to be awful .
What ?
It 's going to be awful this trip home .
Why ?
Because I 'm leaving here at uh-huh . six in the evening , uh-huh . getting to San Francisco at %uh , eleven in the morning , uh-huh . and then hanging around the airport until kid Ted gets out of work
Wait a minute .
The same morning is n't it ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
earlier
Hang around the airport until when ?
Hanging around the airport until Ted gets out of work .
%um that 's awful .
Like six , six hours later
and then %mm I think you should just come here . and then Sunday ,
so I will have slept on the plane .
mhm .
The only sleep I 'll have gotten is on the plane .
uh-huh .
And then Sunday night I 'm taking a redeye <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">which leaves</ENAMEX> At at eleven fifteen
P M ?
y- yeah . Because you said redeye
and then get there at
And arrive arrives in , %uh , Chicago at four fifty - <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven</ENAMEX> .
And then you go to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
The only sleep I 'll get is from eleven fifteen to f- to five in the morning , honestly .
Is this the one that goes to Washington ?
%um , Chica- , no Chicago and then Syracuse .
387.98_388.72_A: oh that 's nice .
My original one went , my original one went to Washington and then Syra-
Maybe you should take that one , though , because it comes earlier , does n't it ?
No , it was n't an option for some reason
oh .
Maybe it was full or something .
%um , but still maybe , you know , maybe you should just get on the next plane , instead of waiting around for Ted .
You 'll be back here by the time he gets there .
You would .
yeah .
yeah .
Well maybe not because if connections , ca n't go direct .
Whine .
%um , but you 're going to go mountain biking ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Maybe</ENAMEX> .
That would be fun .
Does he have a mountain bike for you ?
yeah
Does he ?
Well apparently , because he offered .
Because he offered ,
yeah .
And he , I would imagine that he would know that you 're not travelling around with your bicycle .
Right .
And that you do n't get to keep the yours as a souvenir .
Right .
Or anything <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fun</ENAMEX> like that .
437.08_438.30_B: it 's not a mountain bike .
%huh ?
and it 's not a mountain bike anyway .
No ,
and y- in some of your letters it sounds like you would n't really want to keep it , really .
Just
I did go up a mountain on it .
But
%huh ?
I did go up a mountain , well , not on it , with it .
oh .
Pushing it .
Do you have legs of steel ?
No . I have knees of pain .
You have knees of pain
you have **ouchies** .
I forgot to delete e- **ouchies** from
yeah
you told me .
Did I tell you that ?
And they said **ouchies** ?
yeah .
And I ,
yeah ,
I <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">explained</ENAMEX> a little bit . Trying %um very hard not to be silly .
It 's very , it 's very difficult to explain this with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">any</ENAMEX> kind of straight face
Really ?
w- I did n't mind that I was smiling , but without , like ,
y- you ca n't
e- how do you explain it ?
I 'm very silly
and I , I s- I say **ouchies**, because it it it 's %ah .
And the funny thing is it was Becky that questions it .
Because Becky speaks such , you know , standard English .
She speaks stand- standard English .
Right .
Standard vocabulary
but but <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">**ouchies**</ENAMEX> just really struck her as something very odd .
He
yeah .
And wh- my other thing to tell you , what ?
shower today .
What ?
I do n't get a shower today . oh that 's gross . I 'm sorry because I 'm talking to you on the phone instead
because you 're going to go on the ,
why ca n't you take quick shower ?
They close at ten .
All ,
well ,
oh , oh no .
That 's right .
oh , I 'm sorry .
It 's okay .
You were supposed to get a shower were n't you ?
yeah .
yeah .
%um , oops ?
It 's all right .
I was try- I was here .
I have funny things on me .
So I went to the doctor .
But I made an appointment for seven .
And by ten of eight , and I still had n't been seen ,
and I had just gotten my name called .
So I had to come back , because I was going to call you at eight .
%hm .
yeah .
And ,
yeah .
All my **ouchies** are always skin **ouchies** .
I think of this .
And all your **ouchies** are always in- inner **ouchies** %huh
You got new skin **ouchies** new skin ouchies ?
New skin ouchies .
%hm .
They 're not ouchy at all , actually .
They 're jus- they 're just there .
And they 're very disturbing .
I 'm really worried , actually To , %uh , see anybody ,
so nobody ,
but %um , I could n't get a or two in .
Are you going to camp ?
%huh ?
Are you going to camp ?
I do n't know about that either .
I wanted to .
But
But , all I have is my own car .
And it 's a two hour drive ,
and it 'll be at night ,
and I 'll be by myself , in my car .
And what about tomorrow morning ?
I could go tomorrow morning and turn around and come back tomorrow evening .
oh , you were going to come <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">back tomorrow</ENAMEX> evening ?
Well I have to . What Because , they 're they 're coming back tomorrow evening .
I guess I do n't have to .
I could stay there all by myself .
But %mm %uh . I 'm kind of bored of being by myself ,
I 've been , they left yesterday , so I 've been by myself an awful lot because I did n't <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">have</ENAMEX> a job today .
mhm .
So , you know , I 'm kind of not looking forward to that , or anything .
So . I do n't
what do you think ?
It it sounds a little scary to drive , you know , in your car .
Alone at night .
%eh yeah .
That far .
yeah .
So maybe I should wait until tomorrow .
But I do n't , see the other thing is , I do n't know when they 're coming back tomorrow .
mhm .
So if they 're coming back tomorrow morning , then we 'll pass each other on the way .
mhm .
And that would be really bad .
mhm .
I would really <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">be</ENAMEX> unhappy .
mhm .
What do I do ?
It sounds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">like</ENAMEX> you probably do n't go to camp this weekend .
%eh , do n't go c- , that means do n't go to camp this summer .
You have n't gone ?
No .

Of course I wanted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">you to be</ENAMEX> there .
But , you know . I sh- be I ca n't be mean ,

No you 're not !
So do I skip school ?
I do n't think you 'll have to .

You <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">come in</ENAMEX> at ten ,
and I got <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">to</ENAMEX> leave at noon .
yeah .
That 's not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">fun . At <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">all</ENAMEX></ENAMEX> .
It 's better than nothing .

And then the food .
