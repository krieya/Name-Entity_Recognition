How Should We Care for Our Skin Day - to - Day ?

Who does n't want soft , white skin ?
But in real life our skin often gives us a hard time .
If it 's not darkness or redness in the face , it 's dull and pallid .
What can we do ?
Appropriately adjusting our diet could bring great improvements for our skin .
Whatever is the problem with your skin , you should prescribe " vegetables " based on your symptom .
Red face : this is caused by absorbing too much animal fat or protein .
The way to treat this is : when we eat foods containing animal fat or protein , we must supplement it with vegetables that contain plenty of chlorophyll , like spinach , celery or lettuce .
If we eat them raw , the effect is better .
We can also chop vegetables into tiny bits , wrap them in cloth , squeeze the juice and drink it .
Flushed face : the reason is poor circulation of blood , particularly a lack of blood flow to the epithelial cells .
When the weather is cold , people 's faces go red , particularly the tips of their noses .
The way to treat this is : <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.</ENAMEX> Frequently bathe and massage to make the blood flow freely .
Massage the red parts more .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.</ENAMEX> To make the body fully absorb proteins better , we should eat plenty of food containing vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL" S_OFF="1">B1</ENAMEX> and vitamin C .
We can improve our absorption of vitamin D by exposure to sunlight .
Oily dark face : this is caused by consuming too many animal oils and vegetable oils .
The way to treat this is : control the amount of animal and vegetable oils we consume and eat more vegetables containing chlorophyll .
Before we eat , we should drink a glass of vegetable juice diluted with warm boiled water .
The effect will be better .
Dark face : generally speaking , the skin of people who consume too much salt is rough and dark .
After exposure to the sun it is even worse .
The hands and feet going black is caused by the salt in the body needing to be flushed out through the extremities .
If we consume too much salt , our face will gradually be covered with a layer of dark skin .
The way to treat this is : <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.</ENAMEX> control our intake of salt , drink plenty of water to flush out the salt through our urine .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.</ENAMEX> Bathing frequently , and soaking in the bathroom until you sweat , can also help to flush out some salt .
Freckles on the face : consuming too much salt may cause freckles to appear on the face .
And if in our diet we only absorb animal fats and protein , this will affect the normal functioning of liver and make the freckles more visible .
So those with freckles must eat plenty of fruit and vegetables .
As well as this , medicine is the great enemy of the skin .
Sedatives in particular will make the body produce too much acid .
The hormones will become unbalanced and freckles will appear on the face .
