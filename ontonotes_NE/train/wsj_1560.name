And you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> audit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reggie Jackson</ENAMEX> , the retired baseball star , has found another use for them .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> , who won the nickname `` Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">October</ENAMEX> '' for his <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Series</ENAMEX> exploits , is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 500</ENAMEX> each .
Dealers say the budding trade in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> 's canceled checks is unusual .
`` I do n't know of any living ballplayer that 's ever done it , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Smalling</ENAMEX> , a dealer in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ames</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> , and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs .
An initial batch of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> 's checks was on sale at a baseball - card show held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Labor Day weekend</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as well .
`` For someone who has everything else -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reggie</ENAMEX> 's jersey , cap and cards -- his checks might be a nice addition , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Vizas</ENAMEX> , owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bill 's Sports Collectibles</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> , who examined the checks at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> card show .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> , the canceled checks of a small number of well - known baseball players have been bought and sold .
But these players were dead .
`` Maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</ENAMEX> , there were a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">-LCB- Ty -RCB- Cobbs</ENAMEX> in the hobby , and awhile back there were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Babe Ruth</ENAMEX> checks , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smalling</ENAMEX> .
However , the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way .
`` Maybe I 'm a little stuffy , but I would n't sell them , '' sniffs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Machon</ENAMEX> , owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Papa 's Sports Cards</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Menlo Park</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif</ENAMEX> .
`` Who knows how much they 'll be worth <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">100 years from now</ENAMEX> ? ''
And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smalling</ENAMEX> does n't believe they 're worth all that much <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">now</ENAMEX> .
`` I do n't think the checks are worth $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</ENAMEX> apiece , '' he says .
Why Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> , who could n't be reached for comment , has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear .
He probably has n't done it for the cash .
`` I would say he 's definitely not in need of money , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Merola</ENAMEX> , an agent of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> 's based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
`` He has good investments . ''
And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> probably has opened new checking accounts , too .
Or at least he should .
`` I assume those accounts are closed , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smalling</ENAMEX> , referring to the accounts of the canceled checks .
`` I do n't think he 'd want to give out his current account numbers .
