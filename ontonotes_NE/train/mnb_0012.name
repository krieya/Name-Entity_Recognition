We are joined by the Reverend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Jackson</ENAMEX> .
Reverend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> , we heard a report earlier this evening that the Vice President had dispatched you , or at least invited you to help in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Get Out the Vote</ENAMEX> effort <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> .
Is that true ?
Well , not just <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few months</ENAMEX> gone about <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> stops around the country .
We did massive voter registration , then <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Get Out the Vote</ENAMEX> efforts .
I think we were along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NAACP</ENAMEX> and others , worked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Get your Souls to the Polls</ENAMEX> on the one hand and on the other hand Say Stay out of the Bushes and it worked .
Do you know anything we do n't know , because so far we have a tight race here ?
A tight race but fact of the matter is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeb Bush 's</ENAMEX> anti-affirmative action action in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> solidified women and people of color and basically we won <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> , thanks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeb Bush</ENAMEX> .
Our vote in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> , we have done <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about 10 days</ENAMEX> of solid work across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> .
Workers fighting for right to organize and women fighting for -- and blacks together .
I think when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> made it clear that he wants a strict constructionist court led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scalia</ENAMEX> , attacked affirmative action , attack of women 's rights , point this strong ideological line is shown in these vote totals <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> so far .
Reverend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> , it 's going to be said , however late we 're at this <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> , and whoever wins it , that it 's going to be so thin , so narrow , that it will be a victory without mandate .
Well , I think what it means is that we must end -- then deal with some consensus issues .
For example , should there not be a consensus that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> should be kept secure and not risked in the marketplace ?
Should we not make a commitment to educate all of our children , not just vouchers for a few of them ?
Maybe something as basic as comprehensive health insurance .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> have no health insurance .
50 -- many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> die <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</ENAMEX> from cancer .
Amounts to a vast majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> people .
Reverend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> the thanks very much as always for coming on with us .
