<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tandy Corp.</ENAMEX> said it wo n't join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> , the group that seeks to battle the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> in the market for computer memory chips .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tandy</ENAMEX> 's decision is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> setback for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> said that it would n't invest in the group .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Apple</ENAMEX> said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> is seeking major investors to back its attempt to crack the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</ENAMEX> market for dynamic random access memory chips , a market dominated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> .
Those chips were in dire shortage <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , hurting many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> computer companies that could n't get sufficient <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> - supplied chips .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tandy</ENAMEX> said its experience during the shortage did n't merit the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million to $ 50 million</ENAMEX> investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> is seeking from each investor .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">At this time</ENAMEX> , we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need -LCB- for DRAMs -RCB- from the market as a rule , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Juge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tandy</ENAMEX> 's director of market planning .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford Kane</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> president , said the decision was `` disappointing , '' but does n't presage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Memories '</ENAMEX> failure .
`` I would like to have had them , '' he said .
But `` they were n't on my list of companies who were critical to be a part of it . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kane</ENAMEX> became president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last June</ENAMEX> , when the group was formed by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> electronics companies : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hewlett - Packard Co.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intel Corp.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LSI Logic Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Semiconductor Corp</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kane</ENAMEX> said he expects <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> major corporations to announce their participation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> soon after the group finishes a business plan , probably <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late this week</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> needs a catalyst , he said , to inspire others to join .
But so far , most potential participants have n't decided .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sun Microsystems Inc.</ENAMEX> said it 's still actively evaluating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> and plans to meet with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> representatives <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">later this week</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Telephone -AMP- Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> said it was waiting to see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Memories '</ENAMEX> business plan .
Personal - computer maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AST Research Inc.</ENAMEX> said it is still studying the situation .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Compaq Computer Corp.</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said that the company has n't made a decision yet , although `` it is n't under active consideration .
