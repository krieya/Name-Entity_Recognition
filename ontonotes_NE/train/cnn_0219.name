The popular band has been criticized within country music circles for comments by lead singer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Natalie Maines</ENAMEX> .
She said she was embarrassed to be from the same state as President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> .
She has since apologized for her remarks .
Hmm , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">those Dixie Chicks</ENAMEX> .
Speaking of chicks -- call it puppy love , call it maternal instinct , but , mostly it 's just out of the ordinary .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea Ash</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kezi</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland</ENAMEX> has this story of chicken that decided to take a new day job .
Reporter :
People have long struggled with the question , Why did the chicken cross the road ? - but all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> family wants to know is , Why did a chicken adopt their <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</ENAMEX> new puppies ?
Every time we looked out our window it was like , What is she doing in there ?
It looks so out of place .
It 's just funny .
Reporter :
The puppies were born <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Easter Sunday</ENAMEX> .
Soon after , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the family 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> chickens flew the coop and took up residence in the crate built especially for the puppies .
They goes in there and nuzzles with the puppies , or lays her eggs and sits there with the mother .
They 're just all happy , a little family in there .
Reporter :
At first the sight shocked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> family .
They tried to shoo the hen away but she kept coming back , even putting up baby gates to try to keep the chicken out .
No match for her .
She simply flew over .
It also got past the puppies ' protective father .
I am going to sit with these punies .
Reporter :
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scotts</ENAMEX> ran it past their vet and the vet assured them if a , as long as the hen left her crate to the do business , she was no harm to the pup .
The family says the chicken keeps the place clean , so she 's free to stay .
A pretty good relationship with that chicken .
She does n't mind them crawling around underneath her .
Reporter :
When the mom comes in , the puppies know exactly where to go for milk -- sort of a little confusion .
The pups do n't exactly know the difference between fur and feathers yet .
After all , they 're only <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week old</ENAMEX> .
Eventually they all find the real mom .
No one knows what will happen as the pups grow older and are able to open their eyes .
Chances are , they 'll always have a fondness from one hen .
Those puppies are in for a heck of a surprise when they do open their eyes , are n't they ?
The puppies come home to roost !
That 's a good one .
That was a great story .
We 'll try to follow that in our next half hour .
