Even I get tired of arguing about tax hikes .
For a change of pace , I invite you to contemplate the hazard posed by that old computer monitor sitting in your basement or the pre-big screen TV collecting dust in your garage .
They contain toxic chemicals --
do n't dump them in the trash !
Be responsible and unload them at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</ENAMEX> electronics recycling events scheduled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this April</ENAMEX> .
If landfilled or incinerated , hazardous materials in common electronic products may be released into the soil , air or water .
Televisions and computer monitors use cathode ray tubes -LRB- CRTs -RRB- , each of which contain as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 pounds</ENAMEX> of lead .
Flat screen TVs and monitors contain mercury .
Printed circuit boards and switches in electronic devices contain small amounts of chromium , cadmium , mercury and lead .
'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almost seventy - five percent</ENAMEX> of all obsolete electronics are still stored in offices and homes . This is a great opportunity to get rid of that old PC or VCR that has been collecting dust and know it will be responsibly reused or recycled , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Computer Recycling Initiative 's</ENAMEX> Director , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carrie Dorsey</ENAMEX> .

Good idea .
I 'd feel a lot better about it if the stuff did n't wind up going to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and being `` recycled '' in a manner that is environmentally unfriendly .
It 's kind of like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> soft drink cans .
Turns out they were being ground up and turned into substrate for leaching gold : a pretty nast process .
Darn , they are n't hitting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Spotsy</ENAMEX> .
I 've got <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> dead monitors taking up space in my office .
Jim , on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Virginia Recycling Markets Development Council</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mid-Atlantic Consortium of Recycling and Economic Development</ENAMEX> Officials -LRB- MACREDO -RRB- , thanks for plugging e-cycling .
Such events are becoming more frequent and more convenient to more <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> residents , although based on cod 's comment , we still have a ways to go .
A well - used economic development tool is the incubator , typically an office building that is subdivided and provides subsidized rent and admin services to small business that have outgrown their garage or bedroom , but are too small for leased space .
These incubators typically cater to high tech or `` clean '' service businesses .
I have always thought we should consider setting up recycling `` incubators '' at landfills and transfer stations .
E-waste and construction waste are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> potentially profitable steams
and nurturing small recycling businesses might serve both an economic development good and a public good .
A person with a pick - up truck could start such a business pretty easily .
The cost of a trailer or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> and a covered space would probably be much less than equivalent office space .
If we stimulated home - grown markets , we might not send so much to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , although I suppose anything we can do to curb the trade deficit might be considered a good thing in some quarters .
That 's right .
I know a guy who gets surplus building materials sorts and resells it .
I 've bought quite a bit from him
and he apparently does a good business .
The business itself is somewhat trashy looking .
It appears that it is located on part of an old family farm ,
and the nearby houses are ones that have been spun off to family memebers .
But if anybody else tried to duplicate it , I ca n't think of anyplace in my county where it would be allowed , or else the requirements would be so onerous it could n't survive .
In my home town , they once built an entire tanker truck for the fire department , out of stuff that came from the dump .
We had really low taxes .
The dump had well organized recycling areas located around the central landfill pit ,
and people had a good eye for things that others might want .
Recycling is a really good idea ,
but it is hard to make it pay ,
and it has a waste stream of its own .
What we need to do is to move the recycling process forward into the repair world .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Volkswagen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beetle</ENAMEX> was a terrible car ,
but it was eminently recyclable .
I had <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">almost twenty years</ENAMEX>
and at the end there was n't a single part that was original .
The entire body had been swapped out , the machinery several times , and the running gear many times .
It was still running when I sold it ,
but if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">VDOT</ENAMEX> ever checked the serial numbers , I do n't know what would happen .
The other thing we need to do is expand the deposit idea .
In addition to having deposits on soft drink bottles , we should have them on appliances , autos and other big ticket items where they can do some good .
The deposit would flow to the recycler who is the final user :
this would make recycling profitable .
He would claim the refund from the manufacturer .
This would ensure that the user of a product pays for its disposal ,
and manufacturers would have an incentive to keep the deposit money as long as possible by building items that can be repaired rather than disposed of .
In the case of foreign manufacturers , the recycling fee would haqve a similar effect as an import duty and could be collected in the same way , but without being called a tariff .
Why do some localities charge for the service while others do n't ?
Just curious .
Because , for the most part , it is a money losing operation , or at most marginal .
Recall the story of mandatory newspaper recycling in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">District</ENAMEX> .
As a political city , they created so much waste product they flooded the market .
If you want to look down the road , think about what is going to happen after we spend <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few billion</ENAMEX> to meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Chesapeake Bay</ENAMEX> waste water restrictions .
Where are we going to put all the sludge that results ?
Once we stop putting it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Bay</ENAMEX> , we are going to have to put it on the land .
Then we will have regulations to prevent sludge runoff in order that we do n't pay for the same sludge creation multiple times .
Eventually we will outlaw gravity so that sludge is prohibited from running downhill .
Coming soon to a farm near you : <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two month 's</ENAMEX> worth of stench .
As an engineer and a flinty <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">New Englander</ENAMEX> , and a farmer , I spend a lot of time fixing old junk .
I ca n't stand throwing something away .
Maybe some of it comes from growing up on an island where there was no place to throw it .
My father used to say that garbage was like scotch tape .
-LRB- Shaking his thumb with an imaginary loop of tape on it . -RRB-
`` You ca n't throw it away ,
you can only stick it someplace else . ''
When I 'm repairing something that was designed so it ca n't be fixed , it makes me crazy .
I want to go find some enginner and marketing guy an knock heads together .
Here are a few examples .
A rototiller with gears made out of free machining brass .
Guaranteed to fail .
A windshiel wiper motor installed in a totally inaccessible place under the dash .
It was installed by compressing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> little rubber studs into holes in the sheet metal , and sealed with a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ten inch</ENAMEX> oblong flat gasket .
When the rubber studs rotted away , the motor fell on the floor , followed by a torrent of rain that shorted out everything under the dash .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1/4 inch</ENAMEX> diameter spring loaded shift lever detent that you had to break the tractor in half to replace .
Every piece of household plumbing and wiring I ever had to fish through a hollow wall .
Anything that can only be repaired upside down .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve</ENAMEX> bolt circle on a transmission housing with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> hex head bolts and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> star pattern bolts .
Try and figure that out in the dark under the car .
The ignitor for the gas range that costs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</ENAMEX> of what the range cost .
What 's worse is , that because I 'm good at this , people think I like it .
Wrong .
I hate things
and I love flesh .
I 'm convinced that things are inhabited with Gremlins .
It 's a vicious circle .
The more stuff you have the more stuff you need to maintain it , like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> Highways .
It starts with a screwdriver ,
and next thing you know it 's a shopfull of air compressors , saws , welders , a forklift , an earthmover , a dump truck to haul the earthmover .....
My wife takes great glee in making fun of all of this .
Then I pointed out all he special purpose tools in her kithchen ,
and that is just for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> job .
She carefuly forgets all that when she needs something and it turns out that I have just the right framitz to manufacture a repair piece for her thing - a - bob .
I 'm convinced that we could solve our balance of payments deficits if we just passed must be repairable laws .
Every engineer should be required to be a mechanic for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</ENAMEX> .
For many of us our life has come down to buy it at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wal - mart</ENAMEX> and take it to the dump .
Even if you buy it at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BMW</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">John Deere</ENAMEX> dealer it is no different .
So , if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PEC</ENAMEX> wants to make a supporter out of me , the way to do it is to start a campaign that ensures things do n't have to be thrown away , not one to recycle them at a loss .
I work for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">E-Tech Recycling Inc</ENAMEX> -LRB- http://www.etechrecycling.com -RRB- , an electronics recycling company located in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> .
We recycle all types of electronics items such as computers , monitors , TVs etc.
When I speak with people about the importance of recycling electronic items , they are very ignorant .
I think more than anything , we need to educate people about the importance of recycling .
