<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> called on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve System</ENAMEX> to lower interest rates .
In a speech to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Mortgage Bankers Association</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> broke the administration 's public silence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> and complained that `` interest rates are too high . ''
`` I am convinced that a monetary policy for this country that would return interest rates to the historical level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> would have not only an immediate impact on housing starts , the housing stock , our industry in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , the refurbishing of our industrial system , it would help the Third World economies considerably and it would particularly have a favorable impact upon our budget deficit , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> said .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> recently eased credit by lowering the bellwether federal funds interest rate to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 3/4 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration officials say inflation is under control .
With economic growth slowing , they say they believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> should ease credit even further .
But for the most part , officials have avoided expressing those views in public , fearing they would unnecessarily antagonize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fed</ENAMEX> .
