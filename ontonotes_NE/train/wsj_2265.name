Commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , the stock market 's influence at first created nervousness .
Later , however , it became more of an undercurrent than a dominating force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors .
Gold , the traditional haven in times of financial crisis , continued its inverse lockstep with the dollar , rising <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early in the day</ENAMEX> as the currency fell , and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered .
Copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy .
Copper fell and showed little rebound through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved .
Crude oil declined early , but as the stock market retained early gains , it , too , became stronger , ending with a small net loss .
Trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> , grain and soybean prices rose slightly .
Livestock and meat prices , however , dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork .
In commodity markets <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> : PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved independently , first falling and then later rising .
Silver performed quietly .
The spot <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> gold price rose $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">367.30</ENAMEX> an ounce .
The more active <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> delivery gold settled with a gain of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.90</ENAMEX> an ounce at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">371.20</ENAMEX> , after trading <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as $ 374</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> silver was up <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.3 cents</ENAMEX> an ounce at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.163</ENAMEX> .
Platinum behaved more like an industrial metal , easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy , but recovering later , as the stock market strengthened .
Gold was nowhere the spectacular performer it was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Black Monday</ENAMEX> .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last Friday</ENAMEX> , precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late - in - the - day</ENAMEX> nose dive , so it could n't react to it .
Back on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday , Oct. 16 , l987</ENAMEX> , the stock market declined during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> , and gold prices surged as the stock market fell .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1987</ENAMEX> contract <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</ENAMEX> rose <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 8.70</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as $ 471.60</ENAMEX> , and the more deferred positions , due to mature <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">as late as March 1989</ENAMEX> , rose <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 9.60</ENAMEX> .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Black Monday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 19 , 1987</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> contract tacked on further gains , rising to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as $ 491.50</ENAMEX> for a gain of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 20</ENAMEX> on top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> advances , before giving up <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 10</ENAMEX> of that at the close .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> gain of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4</ENAMEX> was miniscule compared with that .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> analyst , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Cardillo</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Josephthal -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , said the gold market already had some good price - supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock market .
`` What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardillo</ENAMEX> .
There 's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further , he said .
He expects a drop in interest rates , which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising .
Finally , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardillo</ENAMEX> , the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> merchandise trade deficit , when the figures are released <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold , he said .
ENERGY :
Worried that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</ENAMEX> - point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things to come for the economy , petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> benchmark crude , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">West Texas Intermediate</ENAMEX> , closed at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">20.59</ENAMEX> a barrel for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> delivery , down <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 cents</ENAMEX> .
Some analysts said crude was due for a correction anyhow , following <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</ENAMEX> of significant gains .
But most market observers agreed that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's stock market drop is what dampened spirits in the petroleum pits <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
Until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</ENAMEX> increased its production ceiling for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth quarter</ENAMEX> based on projections of robust demand .
So any bearish indicator , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's precipitous drop in the stock market , sends shivers through the oil markets as well .
Indeed , after reacting early in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the trading day</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's plummet , futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market 's partial recovery <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
COPPER :
Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> contract declined <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.05 cents</ENAMEX> a pound to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.2745</ENAMEX> .
Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use .
But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - month</ENAMEX> strike at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> mine in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> was about over , according to an analyst .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> is a large <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> producer and principal supplier to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle , the contracting out of work by the company .
Now , the analyst said , only minor points remain to be cleaned up .
`` For all intents and purposes , an agreement appears to have been achieved , '' he said .
Copper inventories in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> warehouses rose <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">516 tons</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10,004 tons</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">London Metal Exchange</ENAMEX> copper inventories <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> declined <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13,575 tons</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">89,300 tons</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LME</ENAMEX> stocks decline was about as expected , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Comex</ENAMEX> gain was n't .
However , this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market , the analyst said .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> point in futures trading , as the stock market firmed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> contract rose to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as $ 1.2965</ENAMEX> , but it was n't able to sustain the gain .
`` It was simply overbought , '' he said , and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices .
COTTON :
Futures prices eased , more in reaction to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Jerry</ENAMEX> than to any influence of the stock market .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> contract ended with a loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.22 cent</ENAMEX> a pound , at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">74.48 cents</ENAMEX> .
Technical considerations following the hurricane , which was a factor in the market <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , caused prices to decline <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Simon</ENAMEX> , cotton specialist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential - Bache Securities</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
Prices rose sharply <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> as the storm approached <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> , which is part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mississippi Delta</ENAMEX> cotton - growing area .
However , after absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane , prices began to slip <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Friday</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon</ENAMEX> said .
That selling continued <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> and kept prices under pressure , he said .
Colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and the northern states of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Delta</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming weekend</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon</ENAMEX> said .
That has n't yet captured traders ' attention , he added .
SUGAR :
Futures prices declined .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March</ENAMEX> contract was off <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.32 cent</ENAMEX> a pound at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">13.97 cents</ENAMEX> .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> point in early trading the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March</ENAMEX> price rose to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as 14.22 cents</ENAMEX> when the stock market recovered , but the price then fell back .
A price - depressing factor , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> analyst said , was that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> , which had been expected to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">around 200,000 tons</ENAMEX> of sugar in the world market , did n't make any purchases .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> recently bought <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200,000 tons</ENAMEX> and was expected to buy more , the analyst said .
Another analyst thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar , it could buy at lower prices , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith Ganes</ENAMEX> , analyst for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
At any rate , she added , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> needs the sugar , so it will be in sooner or later to buy it . ''
FARM PRODUCTS :
The prices of cattle and hog futures contracts dropped sharply because traders speculated that the stock market plunge <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> will linger in the minds of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> consumers long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the supermarket , which would hurt demand for beef and pork .
The price of the hog contract for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> delivery dropped its maximum permissible <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> limit of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5 cents</ENAMEX> a pound .
The prices of most grain futures contracts rose slightly <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> out of relief that the stock market was showing signs of recovering .
Earlier in the session , the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows .
A broad rally began when several major processors began buying futures contracts , apparently to take advantage of the price dip .
