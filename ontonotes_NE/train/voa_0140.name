<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The United States</ENAMEX> responded cautiously <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> to a declaration by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> that it would resume oil exports to fulfill existing contracts .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State Department</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Boucher</ENAMEX> said there is no confirmation as yet that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> has in fact begun allowing the loading of oil tankers .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> overseers report that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> is not allowing loadings into tankers .
We reiterate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> is the one who has chosen to suspend oil exports , even though , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Security Council</ENAMEX> agreed to allow shipments to continue while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> concluded a pricing mechanism to reflect a fair market value for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> exports , and once again we make quite clear we continue our work with other governments and with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Energy Agency</ENAMEX> , and we are ready to take action to add supply very quickly as this situation should warm up .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> backed away from an oil export halt that it had called <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days earlier</ENAMEX> .
