Dismal sales at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> dragged the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> car and truck market down below <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year - ago</ENAMEX> levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early October</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> sales period of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> model year .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> major domestic auto makers sold <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160,510</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">North American</ENAMEX> - made cars in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 10 days of October</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.6 %</ENAMEX> drop from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> .
Domestically built truck sales were down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.4 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86,555</ENAMEX> pickups , vans and sport utility vehicles .
The heavy use of incentives to clear out <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> models appears to have taken the steam , at least initially , out of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> model sales , which began officially <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 1</ENAMEX> .
This appears particularly true at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> , which had strong sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> but saw its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early October</ENAMEX> car and truck results fall <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26.3 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year 's</ENAMEX> unusually high level .
Overall , sales of all domestic - made vehicles fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.9 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</ENAMEX> .
Without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> , overall sales for the other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> automakers were roughly flat with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> results .
Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto makers have already adopted incentives on many <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> models , but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up .
`` We 've created a condition where , without incentives , it 's a tough market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Kelly</ENAMEX> , sales manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bill Wink Chevrolet</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dearborn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mich</ENAMEX> .
Car sales fell to a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonally</ENAMEX> adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> selling rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.8 million</ENAMEX> vehicles , the lowest since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1987</ENAMEX> .
The poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost eight million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> .
Furthermore , dealers contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late last week</ENAMEX> said they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's steep market decline .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> 's domestic car sales dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.3 %</ENAMEX> and its domestic trucks were down an even steeper <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28.7 %</ENAMEX> from the same period <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</ENAMEX> .
All of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> divisions except <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cadillac</ENAMEX> showed big declines .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cadillac</ENAMEX> posted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.2 %</ENAMEX> increase despite new competition from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> , the fledging luxury - car division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota Motor Corp</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lexus</ENAMEX> sales were n't available ; the cars are imported and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota</ENAMEX> reports their sales only at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">month - end</ENAMEX> .
The sales drop for the No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> car maker may have been caused in part by the end in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> of dealer incentives that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> offered in addition to consumer rebates and low - interest financing , a company spokesman said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> had a different program in place that continued rewarding dealers until all the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> models had been sold .
Aside from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> , other car makers posted generally mixed results .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</ENAMEX> drop in domestic car sales but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.4 %</ENAMEX> increase in domestic truck sales .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.5 %</ENAMEX> drop in car sales , echoing its generally slow performance <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</ENAMEX> .
However , sales of trucks , including the company 's popular minivans , rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda Motor Co. 's</ENAMEX> sales of domestically built vehicles plunged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21.7 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda</ENAMEX> 's plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marysville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , was gearing up to build <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Accords</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Honda</ENAMEX> spokesman said .
`` We 're really confident everything will bounce back to normal , '' he added .
Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler</ENAMEX> said firm prices on its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> - model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> over comparably equipped <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> models .
Firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this fall</ENAMEX> .
At that time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler</ENAMEX> said base prices , which are n't adjusted for equipment changes , would rise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 4 % and 9 %</ENAMEX> on most vehicle .
a - Totals include only vehicle sales reported in period .
c - Domestic car
d - Percentage change is greater than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">999 %</ENAMEX> .
x - There were <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</ENAMEX> selling days in the most recent period and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> .
Percentage differences based on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> sales rate rather than sales volume .
