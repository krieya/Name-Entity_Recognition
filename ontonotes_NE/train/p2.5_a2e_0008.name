There was a young <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> man who left for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> to study <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">English</ENAMEX> and reside there , in search of a homeland that would appreciate his talent .
This young man learned the language , I will call him by the name -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khaled</ENAMEX> -RRB- , but he is no <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khaled</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khaled</ENAMEX> settled down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> for ten years without coming back to his town in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> .
He got busy with work and lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> society , until a missile company in one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> states realized that this young man had a talent in atomic science .
He was appointed manager of a missile lathe company in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> ; no missile would even leave this company without this young <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> man 's signature .
One day , after ten years of his stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , coincidentally , one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> princes came to the state where this young man resided , and this prince asked for a translator for the doctors .
They told him that there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> young man in the same state who had mastered the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">English</ENAMEX> language , so he told them to bring him to translate for me what the doctors say .
This young man came and spent a month with the prince , translating for him while he stayed in the hospital .
One month after the prince 's arrival in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , he wrote a poem of longing for his people and homeland .
This young man thought to himself and said , I have been here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> for ten years , and I did not send one letter to my family .
I do not know anything about them .
This prince after only one month sent a poem of longing to his family .
So this young man , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khaled</ENAMEX> , decided to return back to his family and homeland .
When the company learned that this young man had decided to return to his homeland , unfortunately <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> fights every <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> talented mind , it made him a victim of heroin and alcohol until he went half crazy .
After that , they allowed him to return to his homeland .
