In the aftermath of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> massacre on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 4</ENAMEX> , economists advanced wildly divergent views on how <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> would be affected .
Among the most upbeat was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BT Brokerage -LRB- Asia -RRB- Ltd</ENAMEX> .
In a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 5</ENAMEX> reaction , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bankers Trust Co.</ENAMEX> unit proclaimed the economy `` shockproof . ''
Others were more cautious .
In a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> analysis titled `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">From Euphoria to Despair</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">W.I. Carr -LRB- Far East -RRB- Ltd.</ENAMEX> , another securities firm , said that eroding confidence might undermine future economic development .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , with business activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> staggering along at an uneven pace , the economy itself seems locked in a struggle between hope and fear .
Manufacturers have survived the turmoil in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> largely unscathed .
Signs of revival seem evident in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> hard - hit hotel sector .
But in the stock and real - estate markets , activity remains spotty even though prices have regained much of their lost ground .
Waning demand reported by importers , retailers and even fancy restaurants all reinforce a profile of a community that is sharply tightening its belt .
As many economists and businessmen see it , those incongruities underscore a paradox that seems likely to bedevil the economy throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</ENAMEX> .
That paradox is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> economically rewarding yet politically perilous relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
As a model of capitalist efficiency on southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's doorstep , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> prospects look good .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's land and labor offer inexpensive alternatives to local industry .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> - bound freight streams through the territory 's port .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</ENAMEX> since the communist nation emerged from isolation , its burgeoning trade with the West has lifted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> status as a regional business center .
These benefits seem secure despite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's current economic and political troubles .
But to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is n't purely business .
It is also the sovereign power that , come <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> , will take over this <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> colony .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's leaders have promised generous liberties for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">post-1997</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
That promise sounds shaky now that those same leaders have fallen back on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Marxist</ENAMEX> dogma and brute force to crush their nation 's democracy movement .
Outflows of people and capital from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> have been growing since the sovereignty issue first arose in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</ENAMEX> .
A widely held assumption all along has been that , given its robust economy , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> will be able to attract sufficient foreign money and talent to comfortably offset the outflows .
With interest in emigration and investment abroad soaring since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 4</ENAMEX> , that assumption no longer seems so safe .
Investment and emigration plans take time to come to fruition .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Only four months</ENAMEX> have passed since the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> massacre , and few are prepared to predict its ultimate impact .
The only consensus is that more money and people may leave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> than had been thought likely .
This expected blow has cast a pall over the economy 's prospects .
The question , as many people see it , is how long such uncertainty will last .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maureen Fraser</ENAMEX> , an economist with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">W.I. Carr</ENAMEX> , a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Banque Indosuez</ENAMEX> , believes that the territory may not be able to regain its momentum until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">some time after 1997</ENAMEX> .
It may experience an upswing or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> in between .
But with local investors shaken by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's political and economic turmoil , she says , a genuine recovery may not arrive until <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> can prove itself secure under <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> sovereignty .
`` Investors have to accept the possibility of a significant slowdown in economic activity in the runup to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> , '' she says .
`` Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few years</ENAMEX> , I would advise caution . ''
In a soon - to - be published book on the territory , a political economist , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miron Mushkat</ENAMEX> , has derived <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> future scenarios from interviews with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> government officials and businessmen .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly half</ENAMEX> of them argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> uneasy relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> will constrain -- though not inhibit -- long - term economic growth .
The rest are split roughly between optimists who expect <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> to hum along as before and pessimists who foresee irreparable chaos .
The interviews took place <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> .
Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> crisis erupted , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mushkat</ENAMEX> says , the scenario as depicted by the middle - of - the - road group bears a remarkable resemblance to the difficulties <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> currently faces .
The consensus of this group , which he dubs `` realists , '' is that the local economy will grow through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rates averaging <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 3 % and 5 %</ENAMEX> .
Such a pace of growth , though respectable for mature industrialized economies , would be unusually slow for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
Only twice since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> gross domestic product growth here fallen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">below 5 %</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two or more consecutive years</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> instance occurred in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1967 - 68</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cultural Revolution</ENAMEX> triggered bloody street rioting in the colony .
The other came in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1974 - 75</ENAMEX> from the combined shock of world recession and a severe local stock market crash .
During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 10 years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> economic growth has averaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.3 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</ENAMEX> .
Given <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> record , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mushkat</ENAMEX> 's `` realists '' might have sounded unduly conservative when the interviews took place <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> .
Under the current circumstances , he says , their scenario no longer seems unrealistic .
`` The city could lose some of its entrepreneurial flavor .
It could lose some of its dynamism , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mushkat</ENAMEX> , a director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Baring Securities -LRB- Hong Kong -RRB- Ltd.</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Barings PLC</ENAMEX> . ``
It does n't have to be a disaster .
It just means that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> would become a less exciting place . ''
Going by official forecasts of GDP , which measures the colony 's output of goods and services , minus foreign income , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mushkat</ENAMEX> 's `` realists '' seem relatively close to the mark .
After taking into account the fallout from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> crisis , the government has projected <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> GDP growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> .
The updated forecast , published <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 25</ENAMEX> , compares with an earlier forecast of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</ENAMEX> published <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.4 %</ENAMEX> rate achieved in
Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piers Jacobs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> financial secretary , says a further downward revision may be justified unless the economy stages a more convincing rally .
`` We are n't looking at anything like a doomsday scenario , '' he says .
`` But clearly we 're entering a difficult period . ''
Many factors besides a dread of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> will have a bearing on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> economy .
One concerns <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> investors .
Barely visible on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> property scene in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> had become the top foreign investor , spending <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 602 million</ENAMEX> .
The market has grown relatively quiet since the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> crisis .
But if the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> return in force , their financial might could compensate to some extent for local investors ' waning commitment .
Another -- and critical -- factor is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> biggest export market .
Even before the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> crisis , weak <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> demand was slowing local economic growth .
Conversely , strong consumer spending in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> helped propel the local economy at more than twice its current rate .
Indeed , a few economists maintain that global forces will continue to govern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> economic rhythm .
Once external conditions , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> demand , swing in the territory 's favor , they argue , local businessmen will probably overcome their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</ENAMEX> worries and continue doing business as usual .
But economic arguments , however solid , wo n't necessarily impress <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.7 million</ENAMEX> people .
Many are refugees , having fled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's unending cycles of political repression and poverty since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Communist Party</ENAMEX> took power in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</ENAMEX> .
As a result , many of those now planning to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> ca n't easily be swayed by momentary improvements in the colony 's political and economic climate .
Emigration applications soared in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> ratified their accord on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> future .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> most prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</ENAMEX> left , up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45,000</ENAMEX> went .
The government predicts that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> outflows will level off over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few years</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 60,000</ENAMEX> -- a projection that is widely regarded as unrealistically low .
A large number of those leaving are managers and professionals .
While no one professes to know the exact cost of such a `` brain drain '' to the economy , hardly anyone doubts that it poses a threat .
`` When the economy loses a big portion of its work force that also happens to include its most productive members , economic growth is bound to be affected , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthong Wong</ENAMEX> , an economist with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hang Seng Bank</ENAMEX> .
