As the sponsor of the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Older Americans Freedom to Work Act</ENAMEX> , '' which would repeal the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> earnings limit for people <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 65 and older</ENAMEX> , I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Depression - era</ENAMEX> fossil .
For every dollar earned <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $ 8,880</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> recipients lose <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</ENAMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefits ; it 's like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> marginal tax .
But the compounded effects of `` seniors only '' taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates .
Imagine a widow who wants to maintain her standard of living at the same level she had before she had to pay the catastrophic surtax .
Although this widow earns only twice the minimum wage , largely due to the earnings limit , she would have to earn <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 4,930</ENAMEX> to offset her catastrophic surtax of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">496</ENAMEX> .
Eliminating the earnings limit would greatly help seniors and reduce the deficit .
Repeal would generate more in new taxes than the government would lose in increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefit payments .
We now need support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Rules Committee</ENAMEX> in order to include earnings - limit reform in the Reconciliation Bill .
Since all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> on the committee are co-sponsors of my bill , it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> who will be held fully accountable if an earnings test amendment is not allowed from the floor .
The time is now to lift the burdensome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Social Security</ENAMEX> earnings limit from the backs of our nation 's seniors .
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Dennis Hastert</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ill</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
