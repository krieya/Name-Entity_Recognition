They want late - <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> shuttles to the biology labs .
They want a <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">24 - hour</ENAMEX> library .
And like college radicals everywhere , they are talking about a demonstration -- where protesters would gather quietly near the science building and raise their hands , classroom style .
Such is the fiber of the wool that woolly intellectuals let fly at gatherings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvard University 's</ENAMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Society of Nerds and Geeks</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SONG</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">SONGsters</ENAMEX> are mad as heck about campus anti-intellectualism and they are n't going to take it anymore , at least not without trying a few really neat ideas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> .
`` We could have called ourselves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Academic Intellectual Society</ENAMEX> , but then everyone would have said , ` Oh , you mean the nerd - and - geek club , ' '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonid Fridman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SONG</ENAMEX> 's graduate - student adviser , told <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</ENAMEX> attendees at the club 's inaugural meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this month</ENAMEX> .
Membership has since swelled to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 20 and 25</ENAMEX> .
Some people may think of nerds as calculator - toting , socially awkward individuals with shirt - pocket liners for their pencils and a preoccupation with computers and matters numerical .
Geeks , by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</ENAMEX> definition , are chicken - mutilating circus freaks .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SONG</ENAMEX> founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremy Kahn</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvard</ENAMEX> junior , thinks of nerds and geeks more as `` nonconformists , '' albeit with a studious bent .
One of the group 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> projects is a `` procrastination hot line '' that students could call when they have an urge to delay studying .
The club plans to show nerdy movies , such as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Real Genius</ENAMEX> , '' in which physics whizzes pop corn with lasers ; and naturally , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the `` Revenge of the Nerds , ''</ENAMEX> a tale of college males with runny noses and ill - fitting pants .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of its `` more ambitious goals '' is to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaime Escalante</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> high - school mathematics teacher featured in the film `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Stand and Deliver</ENAMEX> , '' to come to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvard</ENAMEX> for a guest lecture .
Nerds and geeks sometimes find themselves a bit isolated at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Harvard</ENAMEX> .
So Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kahn</ENAMEX> says high priority is being given to creating a computerized matchmaking service `` where instead of being matched for eye color , you could be matched for similar intellectual interests . ''
For instance ?
`` I 'm a math major , but I want to know about psychobiology .
Hopefully , I 'd find someone in psychobiology who wanted to know more about mathematics . ''
It could work .
Meanwhile , finding a volunteer to write the computer program is n't a problem .
