A letter from Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kerry</ENAMEX> chides us <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> for implying that he had `` flip - flopped '' on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX> .
He correctly says he has been down on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> for some time , hence his criticism of administration mishandling of the attempted coup .
Our <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 12</ENAMEX> editorial should have been more precise .
It meant to convey our hope that the Senator and other members of the congressional left are broadening their dislike of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> to include other notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Central American</ENAMEX> drug runners .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sandinistas</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> , for example , also are part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> - Medellin cartel nexus .
In his letter and on the basis of his losing vote <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> aid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> opposition , Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerry</ENAMEX> makes clear he has not made that intellectual leap .
We were wrong .
