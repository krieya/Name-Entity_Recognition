Wh- what whatever I took you had duplicates of .
Who 's coming
oh , okay ,
I usually try to take <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> instead of -- right -- instead of ordering double prints .
yeah
so and there 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> more that 's %uh -- very cute -- packed up in an envelope
The birthday the %um oh yeah and the playground and the haircut
you got the general idea
then the fan and %uh fan fan fa- did the outdoor and the apples on the floor
and that 's probably
oh y-
what
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sara</ENAMEX> running through the the %um fruit order
Hold on a second .
only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> person at a time
yeah
she got into your fruits
yeah
yeah
Did %um did the outdoor pictures come out fuzzy ?
No ,
yeah
not not great .
I do n't know
is it could there be a reason for that ?
There could be
I do n't know what it is .
It could be a lens does n't adjust well
I 'm
Because it 's always the outdoor pictures .
right
and this
I took a lot of outdoor pictures now .
But they 're not all bad
I do n't know .
oh really ?
yeah
maybe it 's %huh could be the how you face the sun
yeah
and also I think the sunnier the more bright the sun is the fuzzier it comes out for some reason .
could be when it 's too bright it just does n't handle it
yeah
mhm
okay
how are the real ones
good
go enjoy .
Anybody coming ?
how are the real ones
goo- just great
yummy ?
I decided for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">a half an hour</ENAMEX> I can tell you all the that do n't come out on the letter
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">One minute</ENAMEX>
your little daughter she 's
Which one ?
very
the little one very
yeah
oh yes
today she Excuse me . Today she colored up the walls .
I 'm not used to looking out for her
and there she is with a red crayon being
oh
Well , what what gives you that idea ?
The look in her eyes
She is quite
very mischievous looking very
you have %huh
this is quite
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brachalov</ENAMEX> g- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brachalov</ENAMEX> got up in the middle of the night
yeah
and she was wet
yeah
so she tells me even with the diaper yeah so she she tells me she 's all wet .
So we have to take off the pajamas
so she tells me put them in the sun .
In the middle of the night ?
yeah
So it 's not like you know
she I see that she 's beginning to she takes the knowledge that she picks up in one place and she applies it in another place .
uh-huh
I th- I think one of the most intelligent things she 's said so far is one time in the middle of no place , we never discussed it or anything says to me Poppy pants mommy skirt
oh she figured that out .
I thought I thought that was pretty intelligent
What else does she say ?
The other day she 's telling
she she <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recha</ENAMEX> 's her %uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX> 's her doll so she says Sarah you want to go to the store ?
okay
Come into the carriage .
Come

and then you felt like you were hearing a tape recording of yourself .
Very much %uh very much

yeah
uh-huh
%eh she started saying whenever I would ask her where 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX> 's bottle I do n't know
I do n't know
so then I do n't know every time I 'm about to answer I realize how many times I really was about to say I do n't know .
mhm
Like if she 'll ask me where are my crayons where are my where are the crayons . Instead of saying I do n't know , I 'll say %hm well let 's look for them because she parrots back at me I do n't know .

and I
yeah
she wanted to name her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX>
but she thought it would be too confusing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah Chimalback</ENAMEX>
so she named her Channa <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX>
yeah
uh-huh

Your brothers are working hard in day camp ?

That 's what they said anyway .
You could ask them .
okay
%um I wanted to ask you did they
you know you have this lazy susan in your cabinet
yeah
Is that a common item
do they still sell them ?
It 's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX>
yeah
yeah
you want <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> ?
probably <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tupperware</ENAMEX> sells it also .
who
I was thinking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tupperware</ENAMEX> probably also sells it no
I do n't recall seeing it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tupperware</ENAMEX>
but maybe
uh-uh
if they have like a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - tiered one yeah because that would save a lot of space
and you know my cabinets are very high
and things are always
I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> that I have is a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> - tier that I took apart .
oh really
yeah
because my the shelves are relat- %eh %uh
oh
your shelves are high ?
not so high
but they 're yeah they 're pretty high one from the other .
yeah
And so so what happens is to maximize the space everything 's on jumbled on top of everything else
uh-huh
okay
I can look
and then it 's behind
and it 's very far
it 's just i-
whatever
yeah
all right
okay
and so they also I wanted to ask you do you go to these secondhand stores some or you go only when you have a free .
Sometimes
What
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brecha</ENAMEX> could use some <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brecha</ENAMEX> could use some winter jumpers
Wint- jump
She has polo shirts
jumpers
because she has polo shirts galore
I always look for jumpers
but it 's not a common thing because most kids wear pants .
It 's not common .
right
uh-huh
okay
All right
but what size is she
it 's not
she has
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> t <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> t ?
n- no
for sure <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> t even <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> t
and I could always hem it
okay right
th- all the dresses that she 's wearing the smallest is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> t the biggest is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> t .
okay
jumpers
all right
we can look for them
but %uh know I could always hem them
yeah
maybe some are
or if not I mean
yeah
sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Osh Kosh</ENAMEX> makes
If they have it
oh yeah
I got one nice one
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mindy</ENAMEX> my sister - in - law <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mindy</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX> was born gave me a very nice blue yeah uh-huh standard I think it 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Osh Kosh</ENAMEX> stuff g- %um jumper
so it 's a she has a ton of polo shirts because the ones from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> still fit her .
oh uh-huh
so you know I

you did n't get wider on top
uh-huh
well I was a little kid
you had a dress that Oma bought you
and it kept you kept growing
but it did n't get tight on you on top .
So finally I made it into a dropped waist dre-
it was a blue dress with a white ruffle .
I bought a blue and white checkered piece of material
and I made a drop
oh and you made a skirt
It was a dropped waist dress
and a ho-
