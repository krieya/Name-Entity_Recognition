I have n't written about soccer for a long time .
If I still do n't write anything , I will feel even sorry for myself .
I do n't think you can ever get all the people in a team together .
First <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cambiasso</ENAMEX> was injured .
Now he 's back , yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cruz</ENAMEX> has gone for treatment .
And do n't even start on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boba</ENAMEX> ; he 's always injured .
It would even be strange if he was not injured .
But it 's OK , as there 's a back - up for every person 's position , and the back - ups are all pretty strong .
Now if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inter Milan</ENAMEX> formed a second team of a lineup , it would be also very strong indeed .
Tonight they 're playing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisbon</ENAMEX> , and I expect I will get up and watch the game .
Since I went to school I have n't watched much soccer , and now my soccer cravings have kicked in again .
I 've seen a lot of matches this season , but I only watched up to the match where they lost to Bayern .
I believe they wo n't run into that kind of thing again tonight .
The reason they lost to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> in the first leg was actually still that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inter Milan</ENAMEX> were too arrogant .
They did n't give much thought to the strength of their opponents ,
But tonight it 's different , they 've lost before , they are n't allowed to lose again in this match ,
More importantly , if they can just win this match then they can go through early .
I do n't think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancini</ENAMEX> will have failed to understand the importance of this match .
In the club they take this match very seriously .
They think it 's as important as the fight for the lead over the weekend
