<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> is also confronting hostilities on its northern border , hostilities the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> government was hoping would end when it withdrew its troops from Southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five months ago</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> geurillas announced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> that they have captured an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> man and are holding him along with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> soldiers they nabbed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">9 days ago</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> group says that the man was spying for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's intelligence service .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> government insists that he is a private businessman .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Harding</ENAMEX> is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Harding</ENAMEX> how does this capture affect the talks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> ?
Well , it certainly is not going to help matters , but ultimately , of course , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> is deeply critical of the peace process .
They do not like the sort of deals that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> appears to be , at times , ready to make .
Though , I think that if they could stifle the entire peace process at the moment , then that is what they 'd like to do .
There are lot of claims and counter claims about this captured man and what he does .
What do we know for sure about him ?
It is very difficult to be sure at the moment .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> is saying <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> are saying another and when we are talking about a possible member of the secret services of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mossad</ENAMEX> , it is very hard for any one but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> to know for sure .
Clearly , this is a man who was travelling on some other passport somewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , whether or not an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> citizen , we do n't know it for sure .
Certainly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> say he is .
He would appear to be back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> , under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> guard .
Beyond that , we have these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> conflicting reports from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> .
I guess it 's a question of trying to choose which is the more credible , and that 's a very difficult call at the moment .
Well , whatever his identity and his aim , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> is using the information about him as a bargaining chip , it would seem .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Husain Nebrusi</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Hezbollah Information Bureau</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX> had this to say this morning .
We will not tell anything about the conditions of these <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> captured soldiers of the colonel unless we get something in return .
We are determined .
This is not a breach of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Geneva Convention</ENAMEX> .
I mean , I would be saying the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> prisoners , they were not allowed to even see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Red Cross</ENAMEX> as they did n't for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> .
We did n't even know the least information about them .
So , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew</ENAMEX> , when he says that they are looking to get something in return for information about these captured <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> , what in particular do they want to say ?
What are they hoping to achieve ?
Specifically , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> want <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</ENAMEX> prisoners that are currently being held in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> jails .
Many of them , as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> admits , as bargaining chit in this ' Hit the Tag Hostage war ' .
There are also a number of other men believed to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> and also a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> detainees who may or may not come into the equation even when this negotiating process over the fate of these hostages gets off the ground .
And it really struggles to get off the ground so far because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> is taking such a tough line .
Andrew , can you tell us about the ties between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> , particularly in the recent uprising .
I mean those who have criticized the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> withdrawal for its troops from Southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last spring</ENAMEX> have said that it showed that the armed uprisings have won the day and forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> pullout .
Now there have subsequently been accusations that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> has tried to influence the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> toward armed revolt .
Is there any evidence of this ?
Well , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> certainly would like to do that and they are , at the moment , extremely popular in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> territories because <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> taking a tough line at a time when many of them are critical of the more compromising route that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> appears to be taking .
There have been traditional differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> and some of the more extreme groups inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> areas , but at the moment , I think , the aim of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> and other groups is to get over those differences , unite and form a very strong overall group of extremist forces dedicated to destroying the peace process as it now stands .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Harding</ENAMEX> speaking to us from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
