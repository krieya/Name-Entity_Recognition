Chip 's Memory Is Here <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , Here <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tomorrow</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TWO</ENAMEX> COMPANIES plan to market a new chip with ceramic circuits that store data even when the power is off .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> 's most widely used data - storing chips have `` volatile '' memories -- their data disappear if they are n't fed a steady diet of electricity , so they need external power supplies .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Semiconductor Corp.</ENAMEX> and a start - up named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ramtron Corp.</ENAMEX> plan to start shipping so - called ferroelectric memories , which can remember data for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 10 years</ENAMEX> without any current flowing to them .
The chips use materials , such as lead zirconate titanate , to form microscopic switches that retain their data without electricity .
Developers caution that broad applications are <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</ENAMEX> away because the technology is n't fully refined .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ramtron</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colo.</ENAMEX> , plans to start shipping commercial quantities of simple ferroelectric chips in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> .
The company expects the chips eventually to be used in devices that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment , including floppy - disk and hard - disk drives .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Semiconductor</ENAMEX> is getting ferroelectric technology from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Krysalis Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albuquerque</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.M</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National</ENAMEX> says it agreed to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Krysalis</ENAMEX> 's assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips , including a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 - kilobit</ENAMEX> memory , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
Once production hurdles are overcome , the chips could take over a significant part of the market .
In addition to not needing an outside power source , they are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips .
Military buyers have shown interest , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National</ENAMEX> says , because ferroelectric chips resist atomic radiation .
And while <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's non-volatile chips -- such as electronically erasable programmable read - only memory chips -- ca n't be used in a computer 's central memory because they `` learn '' data slowly , ferroelectric chips accept data at very high speeds .
Showing Up in Court Without Being There
AN <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AUSTIN</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> , company plans to make it easy for you show up in court <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a thousand miles</ENAMEX> away without leaving town .
Witnesses often must travel long distances to give face - to - face depositions before lawyers and court reporters .
That means huge travel bills .
And telephone or videotape depositions just do n't match physical encounters .
That could change , thanks to lower long - distance rates and cheaper electronics .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Video Telecom Corp.</ENAMEX> , which markets videoconferencing systems , is working with court reporters to wire a nationwide network to allow depositions by live television .
The company installed a prototype system that connects <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> over digital phone lines .
And it is preparing to set up shop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> other cities where court - reporting agencies can tie conference rooms into the network .
While lawyers arranged individual tie - ups before , the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper .
An attorney will be able to use the network for an <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</ENAMEX> fee of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 200 and $ 400</ENAMEX> , depending on the quality of the picture , to take depositions from witnesses in any of the connected cities .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> Reverse Tack On Patent Protection
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">JAPAN</ENAMEX> 'S MISUSE of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> patents has been a sore point for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> chip makers .
Now at least <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> company is turning the courtroom tables .
Until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">now</ENAMEX> , most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> charges have been responses to suits against them .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hitachi Ltd.</ENAMEX> surprised <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's electronics industry when it accused <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Samsung Electronics Co.</ENAMEX> of using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hitachi</ENAMEX> technology to make dynamic random - access memory chips .
-LRB- A settlement was reached but was n't made public . -RRB-
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hitachi</ENAMEX> went on the offensive against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Motorola Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this month</ENAMEX> with a suit charging that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Motorola</ENAMEX> 's new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MC88200</ENAMEX> chip infringes on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hitachi</ENAMEX> patent .
Another recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hitachi</ENAMEX> suit accuses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Motorola</ENAMEX> of reverse engineering a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hitachi</ENAMEX> technology -- a turnabout from a nation of champion reverse engineers .
The moves illustrate the more aggressive attitude toward patent protection that patent experts say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> is starting to take .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hitachi</ENAMEX> made the reverse - engineering charges in an amendment to a counterclaim filed in a federal district court in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Motorola</ENAMEX> sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hitachi</ENAMEX> for patent violation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hitachi</ENAMEX> charges <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Motorola</ENAMEX> `` has engaged in fraudulent and inequitable conduct in the procurement of certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Motorola</ENAMEX> patents '' used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Motorola</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MC68030</ENAMEX> microprocessor chip .
Translation : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Motorola</ENAMEX> appears to have taken a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hitachi</ENAMEX> technology that is patented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hitachi</ENAMEX> says , and `` tried to make it look like a new technology . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Motorola</ENAMEX> either denied or would n't comment on the various charges .
Odds and Ends
COMPUTER chips that simulate human vision have been developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sharp Corp</ENAMEX> .
They mimic the brain by `` looking '' at an image , extracting the fundamentals -- boundaries , corners and lines -- and translating them into computer data .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sharp</ENAMEX> says the set of chips could improve fax machines , graphics computers or identification systems that recognize facial features ... .
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">N.V . Philips</ENAMEX> unit has created a computer system that processes video images <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</ENAMEX> times faster than conventional systems .
Using reduced instruction - set computing , or RISC , chips made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intergraph</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huntsville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala.</ENAMEX> , the system splits the image it `` sees '' into <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> digital representations , each processed by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> chip .
