The enterovirus detection biochip developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DR. Chip Biotechnology</ENAMEX> takes <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">only six hours</ENAMEX> to give hospitals the answer to whether a sample contains enterovirus , and if it is the deadly strain Entero 71 .
Worldwide , biotechnology is a rising star of the industrial stage .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , in recent years <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Economic Affairs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Science Council</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Health Research Institutes</ENAMEX> have been strongly pursuing " biochip " research programs .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> biochip companies have also been set up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
Just what are biochips ?
What use are they to mankind ?
Why do so many people have such confidence in their future ?
What is the current state of this field in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> ?
And what are the prospects for future development ?
Let 's take a closer look .
In just <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years '</ENAMEX> time , or <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few decades</ENAMEX> , the following scenario could become a reality :
When you 're feeling under the weather , all you need to do is buy a diagnostic biochip from the chemist 's shop , put a drop of urine onto it , and you will find out what is wrong with you - a health check will be as easy as a pregnancy test today .
Everyone will carry with them a biochip bearing a record and analysis of their own DNA .
From it one will not only be able to see one 's own physical condition , but even to predict what diseases one will have in the future .
It will be like an ID card , needed when looking for work , buying insurance or even seeking a partner for love and marriage .
Laboratories will no longer need all kinds of large instruments , for all stages of their experiments will be carried out on little biochips , saving time , effort and money .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Today</ENAMEX> , the scenes outlined above may just seem like pipe dreams .
But these dreams could yet come true , and the key to that happening is those little biochips .
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A dream come true ?</ENAMEX>
Developments such as the sequencing of the human genome and the rapid development of genetic engineering have spawned biotechnology industries like bioinformatics , biomaterials and pharmaceutical engineering , which have emerged as the rising stars of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">21st - century</ENAMEX> industry .
As part of the government 's efforts to promote the biotechnology industry in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1999</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Industrial Technology Research Institute</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ITRI</ENAMEX> -RRB- set up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Biomedical Engineering Center</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BMEC</ENAMEX> -RRB- to actively develop biomedical engineering technologies .
Biochips are one of the core technologies in the field .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BMEC</ENAMEX> general director Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnsee Lee</ENAMEX> says that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ITRI</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - year</ENAMEX> R-AMP-D program in biochip applications and technology is now in its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">second year</ENAMEX> .
Its initial objectives are mainly focused on developing sensor chips to screen for infectious diseases , while later goals will be to develop technologies to test for genetic diseases and cancers .
As well as this new research establishment , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the two years</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1998</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> commercial companies have been set up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> to make biochips : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U - Vision Biotech</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taiwan Genome Sciences</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DR. Chip Biotechnology</ENAMEX> .
Of these , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DR. Chip</ENAMEX> attracted much attention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">this year</ENAMEX> when it developed a chip to detect enteroviruses , a deadly epidemic of which has gripped <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fever chips</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DR. Chip Bio-technology</ENAMEX> was set up in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1998</ENAMEX> .
Vice president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Shin - hwan</ENAMEX> states that the company successfully applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Economic Affairs</ENAMEX> for funding to help it pursue a development program for enterovirus detection chips and test technology .
Today , the enterovirus chip is in the testing phase , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DR. Chip</ENAMEX> is collaborating with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taipei Veterans General Hospital</ENAMEX> to obtain samples with which to establish the accuracy of the chip .
What is so remarkable about the enterovirus detection chip when compared with traditional test methods ?
There are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</ENAMEX> known forms of non-polio enterovirus .
The detection chip does not simply determine whether a person is infected with enterovirus , but can also differentiate between different virus groups , for instance showing whether a sample contains the deadly Entero 71 virus , or Coxsackie A16 , which is easily confused with Entero 71 .
In addition , the chip and its accompanying PCR kit greatly reduce the time required for testing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Shin - hwan</ENAMEX> notes that traditional bacterial and viral cultures take seven to ten days to prepare , and even with the newer molecular biology testing techniques it takes <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</ENAMEX> to get a result .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DR. Chip</ENAMEX> has developed methods to reduce the sample preparation time , which enables a result to be obtained in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">only six hours</ENAMEX> when used in combination with their enterovirus chip .
Furthermore , the initial results of joint trials by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">DR. Chip</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chang Gung University</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Cheng Kung University</ENAMEX> suggest that the chip is over a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</ENAMEX> times more sensitive than traditional test methods .
" In addition to enterovirus , we plan to develop chips to detect other infectious diseases such as hepatitis B , hepatitis C and HIV , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Shin - hwan</ENAMEX> .
Apart from the enterovirus chip , which is already at the testing stage , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the ITRI 's Molecular Biomedical Technology Division</ENAMEX> is also conducting research and development on biochip applications and technology .
Research program director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pan Chao - chi</ENAMEX> states that at present they are actively developing a " fever chip " with a wide range of applications .
Pan explains that in clinical practice , the causes of fever are difficult to quickly diagnose .
A " fever chip " bearing the DNA of common fever - causing viruses and bacteria could be used to determine the cause of the fever and the type of pathogen involved would be a valuable tool .
However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pan</ENAMEX> points out that because of the difficulties in substantially reducing the time needed for sample preparation , the usefulness of such a fever chip is still limited , so that it can not yet be widely promoted .
Where the real money is
At present , most applications for biochips are in academic research and the development of new pharmaceutical drugs .
Demand for them is growing rapidly .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnsee Lee</ENAMEX> says that according to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> market research estimates , the worldwide annual consumption of microarray chips is currently around <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</ENAMEX> ; in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> this is expected to grow to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2 million</ENAMEX> .
Based on a market price per chip of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 1,000</ENAMEX> , the size of the world market in biochips could grow to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 1.2 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</ENAMEX> , and to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 40 billion</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next decade</ENAMEX> .
Thus some people have set their sights on the biochip market , and believe that following <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's success in the semiconductor field , the island could go on to be a major center for contract manufacture of biochips .
Be that as it may , the small number of biochip companies so far established in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> still find their market in domestic research establishments and pharmaceuticals manufacturers .
Although they are also actively developing overseas markets , what interests them most is not biochips per se , nor are they content merely to be contract manufacturers .
" The chips are only a tool , and the big money is not in chip sales .
What counts is the R-AMP-D behind them . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Huang</ENAMEX> , executive vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U - Vision Biotech</ENAMEX> , reveals that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U - Vision</ENAMEX> , which was set up in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1999</ENAMEX> , has signed a contract with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Zen - Bio</ENAMEX> to jointly develop human adipocyte cDNA microarray chips .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> states that research in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> has revealed that adipocytes -LRB- fat cells -RRB- are active regulators of the energy balance in the body , and play an important role in disorders such as obesity , diabetes , osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease .
Thus it is hoped that research into human adipocytes can help in the search for drugs and other therapies to treat these disorders .
Apart from this , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U - Vision</ENAMEX> is also conducting a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one - year</ENAMEX> bacterial genome project , which aims to map the genome of a certain drug - resistant bacterium as a basis for developing new vaccines and drugs .
Drug development
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taiwan Genome Sciences</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TGS</ENAMEX> -RRB- , which was set up in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1999</ENAMEX> as a joint venture by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Uni-President Enterprises Group</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuen Foong Yu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tuntex Groups</ENAMEX> , only entered the biotechnology fray in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April of this year</ENAMEX> .
CEO <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Kuo</ENAMEX> says the investors came to the view that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> needs to develop its biotechnology industries , and therefore they combined their resources to make a long - term investment in the field .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TGS</ENAMEX> 's strategy is to invest in a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> genome research companies , and to sign technology transfer agreements and chip production contracts with them .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuo</ENAMEX> comments that contract production of chips is merely a service activity and a source of income for the company - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TGS</ENAMEX> 's ultimate goal is in doing R-AMP-D work to identify gene sequences as targets for developing new drugs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuo</ENAMEX> states that at present , the number of known target sequences for disease - treating drugs is only around <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> , but as the human genome is mapped out this number can be expected to increase tenfold .
Currently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TGS</ENAMEX> has its sights set mainly on doing research into diseases which are especially prevalent in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> , such as liver and stomach cancers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A chip revolution</ENAMEX>
However , the potential uses for biochips go far beyond the medical applications outlined above .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnsee Lee</ENAMEX> , who as well as heading up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Biomedical Engineering Center</ENAMEX> is also general director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Union Chemical Laboratories</ENAMEX> , a research institute under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ITRI</ENAMEX> umbrella , says that due to biochips ' advantages of miniaturization , parallelism , speed and the ability to reveal the " big picture , " they have a very wide range of applications .
They can not only be used as a research tool in biological , medical and pharmaceutical research and development , and as a clinical diagnostic tool for doing health checks , testing for infectious pathogens , screening blood and so on , but they can also find uses in such areas as defense applications , police forensic work , environmental testing and food testing .
Biochips come in two main types : the microfluidics chip or " lab - on - a - chip , " and the microarray chip or " DNA chip . "
Microfluidics chips bring together biotechnology , microelectronics , micromachining and other technologies to integrate the functions of multiple laboratory instruments onto a single chip in miniaturized form .
Meanwhile on microarray chips , biological molecules such as gene segments , oligonucleotides , proteins or antibodies are bound to the chip surface in an array of tiny spots , and a single chip may carry many tens of thousands of such spots .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BMEC</ENAMEX> researcher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pan Chao - chi</ENAMEX> uses the example of blood screening for a blood bank to illustrate the difference between the two kinds of chips .
To test a blood sample using a microarray chip , the sample must first go through many preparatory steps such as purification , nucleotide extraction , copying , amplification and labeling before being put onto the chip where the " hybridization " reaction takes place .
Finally , the results are analyzed using a detection system .
Hence these chips are only suitable for use in the laboratory .
In contrast , with a lab - on - a - chip system , all the laboratory preparation stages will be done on the chip itself , so that the user need only place a drop of blood directly onto the chip to obtain a result .
At present , microfluidics technology is not yet mature , and no such chips have been launched as commercial products anywhere .
But , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pan Chao - chih</ENAMEX> : " This is the way future biochip development will go . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The poor man 's chip</ENAMEX>
Future prospects also seem infinite for microarray chips , which are already widely used in laboratories and research establishments .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Huang</ENAMEX> notes that DNA chips are an indispensable research tool in molecular biology .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> little biochip , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</ENAMEX> of gene segments can be arranged to simultaneously detect the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</ENAMEX> of genes .
In other words , whereas in the past researchers had to investigate each gene individually , today , using biochips , they can obtain test results for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</ENAMEX> of genes at once .
In particular , biochips not only can speed the pace of research , but can also replace laboratory animals such as rats and rabbits in many experiments , with tests being carried out directly on human genes on the chip .
Thus as research tools biochips are not only convenient and quick , but also more humane .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Konan Peck</ENAMEX> , an assistant research fellow at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Academia Sinica 's Institute of Biomedical Sciences</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBMS</ENAMEX> -RRB- , says that biochips need to be made more widely available as a molecular biology research tool .
With this in mind , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peck</ENAMEX> has developed nylon - based biochips which have been called " the poor man 's biochip , " since they cost <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</ENAMEX> less than glass chips .
Apart from the material itself being cheaper , the nylon chips use a visible - spectrum colorimetric system to display results , so that they can be read using an ordinary optical scanner , which costs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 - 70 %</ENAMEX> less than using a special laser detector .
The nylon membrane biochips currently produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TGS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U - Vision Biotech</ENAMEX> are all derived from the technology developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Konan Peck</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cutting edge</ENAMEX>
Can <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> really repeat its success in the semiconductor industry , to become a major production center for biochips ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BMEC</ENAMEX> director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnsee Lee</ENAMEX> observes that the level of scientific and technical know - how required for biochip production is very high , so that the opportunities for contract manufacture are limited .
However , due to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's early entry into biochip research and development , and the high state of development of its semiconductor industry , the island is well supplied with relevant technology and skills .
Thus , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> , " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> should have opportunities to enter this field not merely as a contract manufacturer . "
The potential and importance of biochips is plain to see , but in this new , interdisciplinary industry , there are still many obstacles and difficulties to overcome .
Apart from the fact that the technology is not yet mature , and that generally accepted , mutually compatible international standards have not yet emerged , the biggest bottleneck for biochips at the moment is the many thousands of patents which have been taken out in the field , which limit the avenues available to each player .
" Because this area is a patents minefield , it 's impossible to create a product which from start to finish does n't infringe on anyone else 's patents , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnsee Lee</ENAMEX> .
In his view , this problem may be resolved in the future by the exchange of patented technologies between players .
In other words , at this stage companies must actively carry out research and development , and obtain international patents , in order to have bargaining chips in future negotiations .
At present , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">BMEC</ENAMEX> has over <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> patents pending in the areas of microfluidics biochips , chip surface processing technology and probe design and applications .
Pushing the envelope
Although at their present stage of development , biochips are already a great help to researchers , they are still far removed from ordinary people 's lives .
But one day they will play an important role in all our lives .
" Applications and commercialization are our goal , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnsee Lee</ENAMEX> .
He says that only if research results are commercialized does research produce an economic payback .
Equally , to have a really broad market biochips need to go beyond the laboratory researcher , and into hospitals , clinics and homes , and to individual users .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> points out that before biochips will be worth commercializing , sample preparation needs to be made convenient , reading results must be simple and easy , the chips ' speed and accuracy must be high , and their cost must be low .
He predicts that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one to two years</ENAMEX> , biochips will be suitable for use in supplemental tests , and after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">around three years</ENAMEX> for high - throughput screening ; in five years time it should be possible to develop them into general screening tools which will be as easy to use as the pregnancy test kits on the market today .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBMS</ENAMEX> associate research fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Konan Peck</ENAMEX> agrees that in the foreseeable future , diagnostic chips will enable everyone to learn their current state of health and know what diseases they may develop in the future .
But in a situation where testing technology is ahead of medical treatment technology , the medical problems so discovered may not be treatable .
Mankind is always challenging his limits , and when , in the near future , biochips lift the veil of many diseases , the next challenge will have only just begun .
