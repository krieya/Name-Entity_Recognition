Adrenaline is high on the flight deck of this carrier at war .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Soon after dawn</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this fourth day</ENAMEX> , confirmation of the ship 's first strike .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Fourth day</ENAMEX> of combat operations <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> bore fruit for the air wing and the ship team here .
We had <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F aircraft</ENAMEX> drop laser - guided bombs , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fs</ENAMEX> drop <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Joint Direct Attack Munitions</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J - DAM</ENAMEX> weapons into eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> of an unknown number of strikes we 'll conduct during our watch in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Operation Enduring Freedom</ENAMEX> . ''
They 'll come back high - fiving and feeling pretty good about it but it is a bit of a somber event that they 're going through out here .
But the biggest thing you 're seeing is the intensity .
Reporter :
The fighter jets dropped their ordnance in a coordinated atack on a convoy near the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghan</ENAMEX> city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Choft</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> says the convoy was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> troops .
There was an attack on a convoy of leadership that was identified through various intelligence means .
That was done within <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the last 24 hours</ENAMEX> .
Reporter :
But the strikes prove controversial .
Local <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghans</ENAMEX> in the convoy say it was a group of elders on their way to the inaugural ceremony for interim <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghan</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamid Karzai</ENAMEX> .
Analysts believe some tribal warlords may have taken advantage of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> firepower by accusing rival leaders of being <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taliban</ENAMEX> and misguiding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence .
The consequence of injuring or hurting someone who is friendly or nonparticipant in combat is very difficult to deal with , and we go to extreme details in -- and do a lot of training as well to make sure that does n't happen .
We have dropped ordnance <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , and I 'm sure we 'll continue to drop ordnance , and do it with precision , do it with accuracy , and do it on call when needed first time every time .
Holy , holy , holy .
Reporter :
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` John C. Stennis ''</ENAMEX> ends its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">first week</ENAMEX> of operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Arabian Sea</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</ENAMEX> is only <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</ENAMEX> away .
Though a choir rehearses in the chapel for a Christmas event , for the crew , it is another workday , their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">first day</ENAMEX> off wo n't be for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">another three weeks</ENAMEX> .
It is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">another day</ENAMEX> for me .
When I 'm out here , I do n't look at a calendar , I do n't think about it .
I stay busy at work .
Reporter :
But there are other chances for the SMIP to gather like this moment of pride to honor sailors who earned a promotion in rank .
It is called a frocking ceremony .
There is a sense of respect that you 'll agree as you walk around this crew is there .
As they take care of one another the whole community comes together .
they follow together as a team or they win together as a team , and I always encourage them to take care of themselves , because if they do n't take care of themselves , then it kind of all falls apart at the seams .
Reporter :
Last time we saw this sailor he was washing dishes in the galley .
Now he 's been promoted , and pilots <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah `` Clutch '' Joiner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russ `` Gladys '' Knight</ENAMEX> say their final good - byes .
Goggles down , let 's go .
Reporter :
Before boarding a cargo flight off <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Stennis</ENAMEX> . ''
They 'll be home in time for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</ENAMEX> .
I 've been here for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four and a half years</ENAMEX> .
It is probably time to go , but I 'm going to miss them .
They 're pretty much my family right now , or my family away from my family .
Reporter :
Savoring <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">every last minute</ENAMEX> on the ship , Commander <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knight</ENAMEX> rushes to the flight <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">only seconds</ENAMEX> before the door closes .
Had is the best tour of my life .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">19 years</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> , it has been the best tour of my life .
Reporter :
For the rest of the crew , there is <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five more months</ENAMEX> to go in this deployment , and no one knows how long <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's new war on terrorism will keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS John C. Stennis ''</ENAMEX> engaged in battle , on highest alert as a carrier at war .
We continue with the pride and professionalism we have shown to date , we ca n't do anything but be successful .
Please make sure you take care of your ship .
Take care of yourselves .
