As we heard from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Gregory</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's main themes in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these last days</ENAMEX> of the campaign is getting rid of partisan gridlock in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , which was exactly what the President was talking about <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> -- an attempt to reopen debate on a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 240 billion</ENAMEX> tax cut plan , saying the version <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> passed is unacceptable , because it is unfair , according to the President , to children and seniors .
Instead of meeting us on common ground , instead of working with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> or congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> leadership closed its doors to compromise -- literally closed the doors to compromise .
They crafted their own partisan tax package and passed it <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</ENAMEX> on a party - line vote .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> leaders for their part said reopening the tax debate is not now realistic and the tax cut bill is probably tombed .
They are angry that the President is threatening to veto it saying it 's wrong to have political budget battles right before the election .
