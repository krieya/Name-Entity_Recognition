When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nucor Corp.</ENAMEX> begins shipping steel from the world 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> thin - slab plant <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</ENAMEX> , it will begin testing the competitive mettle of its giant competitors .
The new technology , which creates a very thin piece of steel , radically reduces the costs of making flat - rolled sheets .
An ebullient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Iverson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nucor</ENAMEX> 's chairman , says the company 's plant eventually will make <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a ton</ENAMEX> of steel in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">1.5 man hours</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">four to six man hours</ENAMEX> at a conventional mill .
`` We 've had the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> , and people from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> visiting us , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iverson</ENAMEX> beams .
`` Everyone in the world is watching us very closely . ''
Especially his neighbors , the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> steelmakers .
Already , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USX Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Armco Inc.</ENAMEX> are studying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nucor</ENAMEX> 's technology to see if they can adopt it .
Says the chief executive officer of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Midwest</ENAMEX> steel company : `` It 's damn worrisome . ''
The once - staid steel industry is about to be turned topsy - turvy by a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990s</ENAMEX> technology revolution .
New , efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller , less cash - rich companies to make steel at a fraction of what Big Steel paid <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">decades ago</ENAMEX> .
It also enables minimills finally to get a toehold in the flat - rolled steel market -- the major steelmakers ' largest , most prized , and until now , untouchable , market .
But such thin - slab technology is only the beginning .
Eager engineers espouse direct - steelmaking and direct casting , which by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 1990s</ENAMEX> will enable production without coke ovens and blast furnaces .
Those massive structures , while posing cost and environmental headaches , effectively locked out all but deep - pocketed giants from steelmaking .
`` There 's a revolution ahead of us that will ultimately change the way we market and distribute steel , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Dennis</ENAMEX> , vice president , manufacturing and technology , for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the American Iron Ore and Steel Institute</ENAMEX> .
It is n't that major steelmakers have blithely ignored high technology .
In fact , they 've spent <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</ENAMEX> to boost the percentage of continously cast steel to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60.9 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> , from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39.6 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years before</ENAMEX> .
Moreover , their balance sheets are rich with diversity , their old plants shuttered , and work forces lean .
But that wo n't suffice .
`` It 's no longer enough to beat the guy down the street .
You have to beat everyone around the world , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis</ENAMEX> .
He wants to see steelmakers more involved in computers and artificial intelligence .
The problem : They 're saddled with huge plants that require costly maintenance .
And try plying new dollars free in a market that is softening , hurt by a strong dollar and concerned about overcapacity -- the industry 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darth Vadar</ENAMEX> .
`` The technology revolution is going to be very threatening to established producers , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Marcus</ENAMEX> , an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber Inc</ENAMEX> .
`` They 've got too much invested in the old stuff and they ca n't get their workers to be flexible . ''
No one expects minimills to eclipse major integrated steelmakers , who remain the undisputed kings of highest - quality steel used for autos and refrigerators .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nucor</ENAMEX> 's plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crawfordsville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ind.</ENAMEX> , ultimately will produce <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only one million tons</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</ENAMEX> , a drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 - million - ton</ENAMEX> - a - year flat - rolled steel bucket , and it will be <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> before such plants can compete in the high - profit market .
Still , flat - rolled is the steel industry 's bread and butter , representing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the 80 million tons</ENAMEX> of steel expected to be shipped <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
Moreover , the process is n't without its headaches .
Because all operations are connected , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">some days</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nucor</ENAMEX> plant does n't produce anything .
`` At this point , the minimill capacity wo n't make a great dent in the integrated market , but it does challenge them to develop new markets , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James McCall</ENAMEX> , vice president , materials , at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Battelle</ENAMEX> , a technology and management - research giant based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> .
Indeed , with demand for steel not growing fast enough to absorb capacity , steelmakers will have to change the way they do business .
In the past , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Armco</ENAMEX> 's chief economist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Corey</ENAMEX> , steelmakers made a product and set it out on the loading dock .
`` We said : ` We 've got a product : if you want it , you can buy it , ' '' he says , adding : `` Now we 're figuring out what people need , and are going back to make it . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Armco</ENAMEX> 's sales representatives visit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the General Motors Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Fairfax</ENAMEX> assembly plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas City</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mo.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three days</ENAMEX> a week .
When they determined that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> needed parts more quickly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Armco</ENAMEX> convinced a steel service center to build a processing plant nearby so shipments could be delivered within <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</ENAMEX> .
Cementing such relationships with major clients -- car and appliance makers -- is a means of survival , especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and flirting with plastic and aluminum makers .
For example , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> began talking about plastic - bodied cars , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the American Iron and Steel Institute</ENAMEX> began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by simply redesigning how a car door is assembled .
But steelmakers must also find new markets .
After letting aluminum - makers take the recycling lead , a group of the nation 's largest steelmakers started a recycling institute to promote steel cans to an environmentally conscious nation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Battelle</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCall</ENAMEX> thinks steelmakers should concentrate more on construction .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Weirton Steel Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Weirton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">W. Va.</ENAMEX> , for example , is touting to homeowners fashionable steel doors , with leaded glass inserts , as a secure and energy - efficient alternative to wooden or aluminum ones .
Other steelmakers envision steel roofs covering suburbia .
Still others are looking at overseas markets .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">USX</ENAMEX> is funneling drilling pipe to steel - hungry <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</ENAMEX> , the nation 's largest steelmaker reactivated its overseas sales operation .
Producers also are trying to differentiate by concentrating on higher - profit output , such as coated and electrogalvanized products , which remain beyond the reach of minimills .
Almost all capital - improvement programs announced by major steelmakers within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</ENAMEX> involve building electrogalvanizing lines , used to produce steel for such products as household appliances and car doors .
But unfortunately , that segment is much smaller than the bread - and - butter flat - rolled steel .
`` It 's like everyone climbing out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the QE II</ENAMEX> and getting into a lifeboat , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Jacobson</ENAMEX> , an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AUS Consultants</ENAMEX> .
`` After a while , someone has to go over the side . ''
Although he does n't expect any bankruptcies , he does see more plants being sold or closed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Crandall</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Brookings Institute</ENAMEX> , agrees .
`` Unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar , it 's unlikely that consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills . ''
Not to mention the incursion of imports .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> steelmakers , which have led the recent technology developments , are anxiously awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> .
Moreover , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> can expect more competition from low - cost producing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Pacific Rim</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Latin American</ENAMEX> countries .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> steelmaker recently announced plans to build a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nucor</ENAMEX> - like plant .
`` People think of the steel business as an old and mundane smokestack business , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iverson</ENAMEX> .
`` They 're dead wrong . ''
