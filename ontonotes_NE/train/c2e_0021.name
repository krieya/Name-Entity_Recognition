Topic : -LSB- CJPT -RSB- Roach : Risk Capital Will Be the Next Bubble .
Posting station : BBS Unnamed space station -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Mon Jan 22</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">21:09:59</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2007</ENAMEX> -RRB- , Dump .
â–¡ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Morgan Stanley 's</ENAMEX> leading economist , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Roach</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Several</ENAMEX> major lessons of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</ENAMEX> rather reasonably explain the main developing trends in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year 's</ENAMEX> markets , namely that the current situation in the financial markets embodies the effects of all these developments interacting with one another .
In particular , in an era of excess current capital , risk capital high - income company bonds , structural credit products , emerging market securities and even staple commodities will be the next bubble .
Global rebalancing .
This is a topic that I have spent much of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last five years</ENAMEX> trying to get people to be concerned about .
To put it simply , the rebalancing theory holds that if the gap between countries with trade surpluses and deficits continues to expand , it will harm the sustained growth of the world 's economy .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two years</ENAMEX> , regular account deficits in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> averaged more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">800 billion dollars</ENAMEX> annually ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> accepted nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</ENAMEX> of the earned surplus reserve of the world 's other countries , the equivalent of needing to bring in <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">some 35 billion dollars</ENAMEX> per average business day in outside financial burden .
In a nutshell , the rebalancing plan the world so urgently needs is nothing more than a thorough reshaping of the global savings mix - that is , an improvement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> savings rate , which has been stagnant for a long time , and a lessening of excessive savings in other countries -LRB- especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
If the world 's savings mix does not change , the rebalancing theory holds that the situation will be very harmful to outside financing in deficit economic systems .
As for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> , this will augur low exchange rates for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollar , and an expansion of effective interest rates on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - dollar capital .
But this did not happen in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</ENAMEX> .
Although as the end of the year approached the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollar dropped somewhat , and effective interest rates continued to climb , this movement was still very far from the radical adjustments predicted by the framework of the rebalancing theory .
This phenomenon has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> possible explanations : <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> is that other factors cropped up and intervened ; the other is that the theory basically does not stand up .
I choose the former ; I believe the reason lies in the prolongation of the period of excess current capital worldwide and the policy of central banks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> of buying up <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollars .
So long as these forces are in play , the effects on financial markets recognized by the rebalancing theory will continue to be softened .
Globalized tracks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> was an important milestone in the globalization process .
Benefiting from an acceleration in the pace of transnational integration , global trade for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time accounted for a record - setting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % - plus</ENAMEX> of global GDP in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1998 to 2006</ENAMEX> , the increase in global trade accounted for fully <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42 %</ENAMEX> of the overall increase in the world 's total output value .
This kind of trade concentration has the potential for a huge macroeconomic impact on global growth .
The rapidly exploding supply of goods and services from low - production - cost developing countries is equivalent in terms of function to a strong anti-inflationary counterblast blowing on the developed world .
Despite rapid rises in energy costs , it is estimated that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</ENAMEX> the CPI inflation rate in the industrialized countries was only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 %</ENAMEX> , about the same as inflation levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</ENAMEX> , which were affected by energy factors , but each year 's " core " elements did not change much .
Although the labor and product markets in most large industrial nations are gradually improving , sustained low inflation is increasingly becoming a global force , exerting an effective counterbalance effect on internal pressures that have always contributed to inflation in developed countries .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> Real Estate Bubble Shock .
Like the stock market bubble <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six years ago</ENAMEX> , another prime - assets bubble burst in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</ENAMEX> ; this time it was the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> real estate bubble .
Just as the bursting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2000 - 01</ENAMEX> stock market bubble led to mild collapse , I am worried that people are discarding too quickly the risk of a similar situation occurring in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2007</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , adjustment of the housing market has just begun ; taking the number of workers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> home construction industry as an example , current figures are only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</ENAMEX> below the cumulative increase over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last five years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</ENAMEX> , over-indebted <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> consumers with their insufficient savings are using their increasingly overvalued houses to support their excessive consumption ; and now housing prices are turning soft , people are losing their rights to redeem their mortgage , and consumer demand will face greater pressures .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</ENAMEX> , in the presence of a dim outlook for housing and consumer markets and high sensitivity to forecasts of ultimate market demand , capital expenditure plans may slacken ; orders for core capital products declined consecutively in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November and December , 2006</ENAMEX> , indicating that the adjustment in this area may already be under way .
Just like the stock market bubble <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six years ago</ENAMEX> , widespread public opinion holds that any damage done by the recent asset bubble will be kept within the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">U.S.</ENAMEX> housing construction industry .
I believe this is a classic example of not learning our lesson .
The Staple Commodities Cycle .
The view that commodity markets have supercycles ran into a serious challenge in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</ENAMEX> .
Oil prices slipped by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 25 %</ENAMEX> from their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-July</ENAMEX> peak and the price of natural gas fell by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 30 %</ENAMEX> , and prices for major metals like copper , which are sensitive to economic trends , showed signs of weakening at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</ENAMEX> .
The main premise of the supercycle theory hangs on an extremely reliable shortage of staple commodities ; this shortage was created because in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 20 - odd years</ENAMEX> there has been a shortage of capital to invest in building new capacity for acquisition and processing .
Whereas the advance of globalization will spur sources of new demand from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and other commodity - intensive economic systems , asymmetry between supply and increasingly fierce demand causes exponents of supercycles to issue the highest commodity price forecasts in history .
In my view , this does not give adequate consideration to latent demand cycles in commodity markets .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> real estate market shock is an example of this ; a sluggish market will cause demand for many materials sensitive to the homebuilding industry to drop sharply .
However , the real demand cycle may depend on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , an economic system that accounts only for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 5 %</ENAMEX> of the world 's GDP , but whose increased consumption of oil and key metals accounted for fully <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> of total global growth <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
Influenced by the slowing of exports to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> , combined with the deliberate cool - down in the overheated investment sector , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's growth will slow <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
These demand factors will be adequate to deliver a decisive blow to the supercycle view of the supply - driven commodity market .
But will the lessons of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</ENAMEX> be the key to success in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2007</ENAMEX> ?
Of course things are not as simple as that .
We can undoubtedly draw some important lessons and tips from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year 's</ENAMEX> economy , but there is another important thing here ; I still believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> main engines driving global growth will slow down under the influence of the burst real estate bubble in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> and the cool - down in investments in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
Even though I do not believe the global economy is in for a hard landing , if global growth slips <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> percentage point below the average of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49 %</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last four years</ENAMEX> , I will not think it unexpected .
My greatest concern is that people continue to treat lightly the continually booming risk assets markets ; they include high - yield corporate bonds , institutional credit products , emerging market securities and even staple commodities , and this is going to be the next bubble .
However , like the stock and real estate markets , the economy tells us that the extreme case of the asset markets can always last longer than we anticipate , particularly in a time of excess current capital , but if the risk assets bubble lasts <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">another year</ENAMEX> , it may cause more problems .
