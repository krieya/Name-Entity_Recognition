This will expand the scale of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> stocks , improve the stock market structure , and promote the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> bond market .
And more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> funds will also appear in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
