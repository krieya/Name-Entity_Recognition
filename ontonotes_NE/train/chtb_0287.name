<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Xinhua News Agency</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 23rd</ENAMEX> , by reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Futian Yang</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Zijin Mountain Observatory</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the China Academy Of Sciences</ENAMEX> announced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> that a nation - wide observation network for the collision of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Shoemaker - Levy 9 Comet</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> had been built in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and a large - scale astronomical observation plan had been formulated as well .
According to experts , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> , which orbits the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Sun</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> , is the largest planet in the solar system .
This incident of observing of the comet colliding with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> possesses extremely important significance in researching and forecasting comets colliding with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> astronomy arena also places great importance on this phenomenon of the comet colliding with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> and will closely focus attention on its development and changes .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few days</ENAMEX> , under the support of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chinese Academy of Sciences</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Natural Science Foundation</ENAMEX> , a seminar on the plan to monitor comet <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Shoemaker - Levy 9</ENAMEX> colliding with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Jupiter</ENAMEX> convened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX> and more than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">forty</ENAMEX> astronomers from all over the country attended .
Experts think that this rare and important astronomical phenomenon requires continuous global observation , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is located at an important longitudinal position between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , so , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's observational material from is an indispensable and irreplaceable component in the international joint observation .
At that time , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> will put all advanced astronomical equipment to use to carry out observation , including <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.16 - meter</ENAMEX> reflecting telescopes , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.26 - meter</ENAMEX> infrared telescopes and radio telescopes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 - meter</ENAMEX> telescopes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">decimeter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">centimeter</ENAMEX> wave bands , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 - meter</ENAMEX> wave band telescopes and advanced optical telescope terminal equipment will also be used .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nanjing Zijin Mountain Observatory</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than forty years</ENAMEX> of experience in the observation and research of comets and asteroids , and its planet research office is the only scientific research organization in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> conducting long term research on comets and asteroids , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">since 1988</ENAMEX> also started researching the issues of the solar system 's celestial bodies colliding .
This station 's planet experts also attended many international scientific seminars on the dangers of comets and asteroids colliding with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> .
