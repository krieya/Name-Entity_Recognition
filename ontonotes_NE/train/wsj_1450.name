<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Bakersfield Supermarket</ENAMEX> went out of business <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last May</ENAMEX> .
The reason was not high interest rates or labor costs .
Nor was there a shortage of customers in the area , the residential <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Inwood</ENAMEX> section of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> .
The business closed when the owner was murdered by robbers .
The owner was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Israel Ortiz</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">29 - year - old</ENAMEX> entrepreneur and father of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">his first year</ENAMEX> of operating the store he bought for $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">220,000</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortiz</ENAMEX> was robbed at least twice at gunpoint .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time he was shot in the hand as he chased the robbers outside .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> time he identified <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> robbers , who were arrested and charged .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two weeks later</ENAMEX> -- perhaps in retaliation -- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortiz</ENAMEX> was shot <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> times in the back , during what police classified as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> robbery attempt .
That was his reward for working until <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">11 p.m.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</ENAMEX> a week to cover his $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,000</ENAMEX> a month rent .
For providing what his customers described as very personal and helpful service .
For creating a focus for neighborhood life .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Israel Ortiz</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of entrepreneurs and their employees who will be injured or killed by crime <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 2 %</ENAMEX> of all retail - sales workers suffer injuries from crime each year , almost twice the national average and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four</ENAMEX> times the rate for teachers , truck drivers , medical workers and door - to - door salespeople .
Only a few other occupations have higher reported rates of criminal injury , such as police , bartenders and taxi drivers .
Yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem .
Recent data from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> provide more of the picture .
While by no means the highest crime community in the country , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small - business development .
A survey of small businesses there was conducted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Interface</ENAMEX> , a policy research organization .
It gave <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,124</ENAMEX> businesses a questionnaire and analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">353</ENAMEX> responses .
The survey found that over a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - year</ENAMEX> period <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</ENAMEX> of the firms said employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Seventeen percent</ENAMEX> reported their customers being robbed .
Crime was the reason that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 %</ENAMEX> reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</ENAMEX> said they were considering moving .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than one - third</ENAMEX> of the responding businesses said they suffer from drug dealing and loitering near their <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">premises</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronx</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> commercial firms is burglarized each year .
Industrial neighborhoods fare even worse , with burglary rates twice the citywide average .
Crime is clearly more deadly to small - scale entrepreneurship than to big businesses .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two decades ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Small Business Administration</ENAMEX> reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yale</ENAMEX> Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Reiss</ENAMEX> 's landmark study of crime against <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</ENAMEX> small businesses drawn from national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IRS</ENAMEX> records .
He found that monetary crime losses , as a proportion of gross receipts , were <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</ENAMEX> times higher for small businesses than for large ones .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> study 's companies averaged <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</ENAMEX> employees ; their <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> crime losses averaged <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 15,000</ENAMEX> , with an <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">additional $ 8,385</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> cost in security -- enough money to hire <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</ENAMEX> more worker .
The costs of crime may also be enough to destroy a struggling business .
Whatever the monetary crime losses , they may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury .
After repeated gun robberies , some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> couple recently sold their liquor store after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">34 years</ENAMEX> in business that included <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> robbery deaths and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</ENAMEX> robberies or burglaries on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">premises</ENAMEX> .
These findings illustrate the vicious cycle that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Institute of Justice</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James K. Stewart</ENAMEX> calls `` crime causing poverty . ''
Underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities , contributing to the poverty of local residents .
Small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs , if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses .
This may help explain why small businesses create <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</ENAMEX> of all jobs nationally , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 22 %</ENAMEX> of jobs in a crime - ridden city like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
Bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> study found that the cost of security measures in firms with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than five</ENAMEX> employees was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 1,000</ENAMEX> per worker , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one - third</ENAMEX> that amount for firms with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10</ENAMEX> employees .
The shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing low - crime business environments .
Private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass to regulate access to these quasi-public places .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> , in fact , revenues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> largest guard companies , primarily serving such big businesses , have increased by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 62 %</ENAMEX> .
Few small neighborhood businesses , however , can afford such protection , even in collaboration with other local merchants .
In the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates , small business generally relies on the public police force for protection .
This creates several problems .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> is that there are not enough police to satisfy small businesses .
The number <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> proposal for reducing crime in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> survey was to put more police on foot or scooter patrol , suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two - thirds</ENAMEX> of the respondents .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 22 %</ENAMEX> supported private security patrols funded by the merchants themselves .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms , which can make urban police less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small businesses .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only half</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> small businesses surveyed , for their part , are satisfied with the police response they receive .
Some cities , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , have experimented with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional patrols funded by local businesses .
But this raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship .
Another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small - business areas .
For cities losing business to suburban shopping centers , it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits .
Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such `` hot spots '' of pedestrian density .
With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Institute of Justice</ENAMEX> support , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> police and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Crime Control Institute</ENAMEX> are currently testing the effects of such a strategy , comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols .
Small - business patrols would be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small - business person is scheduled to testify against a robbery suspect .
While no guarantee , an increased police presence might even deter further attacks .
It might even have saved the life , and business , of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Israel Ortiz</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman</ENAMEX> is a professor of criminology at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of Maryland</ENAMEX> and president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Crime Control Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C</ENAMEX> .
