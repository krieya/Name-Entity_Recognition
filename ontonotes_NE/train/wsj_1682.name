<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX> LIES LOW after the stock market 's roller - coaster ride .
Lawmakers , haunted by charges that some of their comments contributed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash , generally shy away from calls for sweeping new legislation .
But a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House Energy and Commerce</ENAMEX> subcommittee will quiz <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> will go before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate Banking</ENAMEX> panel <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">The market 's wild week</ENAMEX> may speed along the market - reform legislation that has been pending for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> in the aftermath of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash .
It may also expedite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> 's modest pending changes in junk - bond disclosure rules and intensify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's look at plans for giving new tax breaks on dividends and raising taxes on short - term trades by pension funds .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> work well together on the plunge , despite the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> secretary opposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> 's nomination to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SEC</ENAMEX> post .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BAKER</ENAMEX> FALTERS in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Mideast</ENAMEX> amid <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Israeli</ENAMEX> paralysis and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> politics .
Despite seeing his plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Israeli</ENAMEX> - Palestinian elections wither , the cautious secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">state</ENAMEX> is so far unwilling to cut <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economic or military aid to force <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> cooperation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> nonetheless remains furious both at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamir</ENAMEX> , for backing down on the elections , and at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamir</ENAMEX> 's rival , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX> , for political ineptitude in forcing a premature cabinet vote on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> 's plan .
Meanwhile , some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials fear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PLO</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> is getting cold feet and may back off from his recent moderation and renunciation of terrorism .
He is under intense fire from other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> groups ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> is pushing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmad Jibril</ENAMEX> , whose terrorist band is blamed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pan Am</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</ENAMEX> bombing , as an alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON" E_OFF="2">DARMAN'S</ENAMEX> MANEUVERS on the budget and capital gains hurt him in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> were angered by the budget director 's rejection of Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> 's effort to expedite a deficitcutting measure by stripping it of the capital - gains tax cut as well as pet <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> projects .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> now blames the clash on miscommunication , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel</ENAMEX> , who carried the offer to him , observes , `` I was speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> at the time , and quite loud so I could be understood . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> ridicules the budget chief on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> floor .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> counterpart <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> , asked to interpret <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> 's threat to make permanent the across - the - board <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm - Rudman</ENAMEX> cuts that took effect <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> , says , `` I do n't even bother to interpret them . ''
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> suggests such tensions will dissipate quickly .
`` If I can show signs of maturity , almost anybody can , '' he jokes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">HHS</ENAMEX> OFFICIALS expect Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> to continue a ban on research using fetal tissue .
Before he was confirmed , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> said he had `` reservations about any blanket prohibitions on medical research . ''
But now , an official says , he is `` surrounded by right - to - lifers , '' who contend that any breakthroughs in fetal - tissue research could increase the demand for abortions .
COOPERATION WANES on weapons development between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> pull out of a proposal to build new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> frigates ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> have each withdrawn from missile projects .
Defense experts say joint projects are increasingly squeezed by budget pressures and the desire to save domestic jobs ; some also fear rising protectionism as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> unity nears .
BOTH SIDES NOW :
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> lieutenant governor candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddy Dalton</ENAMEX> tries to have it both ways on the abortion issue .
Though she opposes abortion in almost all cases , she airs a TV commercial using pro-choice buzzwords .
`` A woman ought to have a choice in cases where her life or health are in danger and in cases of rape or incest , '' she proclaims .
HOT TOPIC :
Interest in the abortion issue is so great that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hotline</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> , computer - distributed political newsletter , comes up with a spinoff product called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Abortion Report</ENAMEX> dealing solely with its political implications .
CONSERVATIVES EXPECT <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> to solidify their majority on a key court .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> vacancies to fill on the prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">D.C. Circuit Court</ENAMEX> , which handles many important regulatory issues and is often considered a warm - up for future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> nominees .
Conservatives now hold only a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</ENAMEX> - 4 edge .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> slot is expected to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">EEOC</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarence Thomas</ENAMEX> , a black conservative ; after mulling a fight , liberals now probably wo n't put up a major struggle against him .
Other conservatives thought to be on the administration 's short list include <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Uhlmann</ENAMEX> , who was passed over for the No. <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> job at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Breger</ENAMEX> , chairman of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> agency on administration .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration would also like to nominate a woman ; <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> possibility is former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justice Department</ENAMEX> official <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria Toensing</ENAMEX> .
MINOR MEMOS :
In the wake of the failed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> coup , a bumper sticker appears : `` Ollie Would Have Got Him . '' ...
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcia</ENAMEX> , on trial for bribery and extortion , puts statements in the Congressional Record attributing missed votes to `` scheduling conflicts . '' ...
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> fund - raising letter from Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX> is made to appear personally written , and its opening line is , `` Please excuse my handwriting . ''
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burns</ENAMEX> confesses in an interview : `` That 's not my handwriting .
