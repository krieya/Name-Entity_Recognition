Slowing sales of its profitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jeep</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cherokee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wagoneer</ENAMEX> sport utility vehicles are forcing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> to temporarily idle its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , assembly plant for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1986</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 5,500</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</ENAMEX> workers will be laid off for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</ENAMEX> beginning <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 23</ENAMEX> , and overtime has been eliminated at the plant for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth quarter</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler</ENAMEX> spokesman said .
That 's a significant change from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> when the plant worked substantial overtime only to have sales fall short of the company 's bullish expectations .
Sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cherokee</ENAMEX> , the best - selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jeep</ENAMEX> , and the lower - volume <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wagoneer</ENAMEX> were actually up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 %</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of last month</ENAMEX> .
But that 's less than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler</ENAMEX> officials had hoped when they set ambitious production schedules for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> plant <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> .
Even when it became clear <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</ENAMEX> that demand was n't coming up to expectations , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler</ENAMEX> officials `` resisted '' cutting output because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cherokee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wagoneer</ENAMEX> are `` very profitable vehicles , '' the spokesman said .
Instead , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler</ENAMEX> officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late May</ENAMEX> slapped $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> cash rebates on the vehicles , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> such incentives on the popular four - door <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cherokee</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler</ENAMEX> bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jeep</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> .
The incentives boosted sales for a while , but the pace had cooled by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> .
The result : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler</ENAMEX> dealers had a bloated <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">82 - day</ENAMEX> supply of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cherokee</ENAMEX> as of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of last month</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">161 - day</ENAMEX> supply of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Comanche</ENAMEX> pickup , which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> also builds .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">60 - day to 65 - day</ENAMEX> supply is considered normal .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jasper Jeep - Eagle</ENAMEX> , one of the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Jeep</ENAMEX> dealerships in the country , inventories have continued to swell .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Lowe</ENAMEX> , general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jasper</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga.</ENAMEX> , dealership , said new rebates of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">500</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> on the models have stimulated sales , but not enough to significantly cut dealer stocks .
`` If people are n't buying , you have to close plants , '' he said .
Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler</ENAMEX> said it will idle for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX> assembly plant that builds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LeBaron</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dodge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Daytona</ENAMEX> models .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chrysler</ENAMEX> officials said the plant is scheduled to resume production on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 20.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,300</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</ENAMEX> workers will be affected .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , said it will idle for yet another week its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Linden</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , assembly plant , bringing to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</ENAMEX> the total time that plant will be idled during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> said the assembly plant , which builds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> Corsica and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beretta</ENAMEX> compact cars , originally was scheduled to reopen <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> but now will not resume production until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 30</ENAMEX> .
The shutdown affects <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</ENAMEX> workers and will cut output by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 4,320</ENAMEX> cars .
Sluggish sales of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beretta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corsica</ENAMEX> spurred <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> to offer <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 800 rebates</ENAMEX> on those cars .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corsica</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beretta</ENAMEX> make up the highest - volume car line at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> , but sales of the cars are off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.6 %</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</ENAMEX> , and fell a steep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34.2 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early this month</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GM</ENAMEX> has scheduled overtime at its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lordstown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Janesville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wis.</ENAMEX> , assembly plants , which build the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cavalier</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> said it will shut down for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</ENAMEX> its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kentucky Truck Plant</ENAMEX> because of a `` shortage of dealer orders . ''
The shutdown will idle <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</ENAMEX> employees and eliminate production of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1,300</ENAMEX> medium and heavy duty trucks .
The assembly plant is scheduled to resume production on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 30</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</ENAMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto makers plan to build <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">143,178</ENAMEX> cars <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.7 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">162,190</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</ENAMEX> and flat with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">142,117</ENAMEX> car output .
