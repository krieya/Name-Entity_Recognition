<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> consumer prices rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , according to provisional estimates by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Statistics Institute</ENAMEX> .
The agency noted that because of a strike by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> personnel the provisional estimate does n't correspond exactly to the consumer price index usually published .
The agency noted , however , the estimate will likely be confirmed .
The institute did n't estimate <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> price growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</ENAMEX> rise by the consumer price index would put growth at either <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">178.8</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">178.9</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.3 % or 3.4 %</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year - earlier</ENAMEX> level of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">173.1</ENAMEX> .
The index was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">178.5</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> and is based on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</ENAMEX> equaling <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> .
