<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> may be <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's public enemies , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> entertainment giants could end up becoming partners in a number of ventures as part of a settlement of their acrimonious legal dispute over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> producers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Peters</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX> studio and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> signaled they are close to a settlement <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , asking a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> Superior Court to postpone a hearing scheduled for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner</ENAMEX> 's request for a preliminary injunction blocking Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> from taking the top posts at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc</ENAMEX> .
In separate statements , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides said they want to have `` further discussions . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> is acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Guber - Peters Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> separate transactions valued at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 5 billion</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> , which is being acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Time Warner</ENAMEX> , has filed a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> breach - of - contract suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> producers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year</ENAMEX> exclusive contract with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> that requires them to make movies exclusively at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX> studio .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides in the legal battle have hurled accusations of duplicity at each other for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</ENAMEX> , and both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> have accused each other of trying to sabotage each other 's prospects for success in the entertainment business .
But it may amount to little more than posturing ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> have continued on - again , off - again settlement talks over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few weeks</ENAMEX> , and people familiar with the talks say the matter could be resolved within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</ENAMEX> .
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions .
But the people familiar with the talks said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner</ENAMEX> is n't expected to get any cash in the settlement .
Instead , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> is likely to agree to let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner</ENAMEX> participate in certain of its businesses , such as the record club of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS Records</ENAMEX> unit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner</ENAMEX> has surpassed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> as the largest record company , but it does n't have a powerful world - wide record club like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides are also discussing certain business ventures involving cable rights to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbia</ENAMEX> 's movies .
In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> is expected to agree to swap <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbia</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</ENAMEX> stake in the sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burbank</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , studio that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbia</ENAMEX> share , in exchange for the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MGM</ENAMEX> studio lot that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner</ENAMEX> acquired with the purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lorimar Telepictures Corp</ENAMEX> .
Still , it may be tough for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> to have a smooth partnership in anything , in the wake of sworn affidavits filed over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last week</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> , for example , came from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS Records</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Yetnikoff</ENAMEX> , who will head a committee that will oversee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> 's entertainment division , including both records and movies .
In his affidavit , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yetnikoff</ENAMEX> accused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven J. Ross</ENAMEX> of having an `` antiSony , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP" S_OFF="5">anti-Japanese</ENAMEX> bias '' and said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> had tried to talk him out of letting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS Records</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> for that reason .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> , who will be chairman and co-chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Time Warner</ENAMEX> after the merger is complete , denied that in his own affidavit , and called Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yetnikoff</ENAMEX> 's remarks `` vicious '' and his claims `` reckless , irresponsible and baseless , '' saying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner</ENAMEX> under his leadership has started a number of businesses in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> also said he enjoys `` warm professional and personal relationships '' with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> executives including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akio Morita</ENAMEX> , `` who has visited my home here . ''
But despite the acrimony between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yetnikoff</ENAMEX> , officials of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Time</ENAMEX> side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Time Warner</ENAMEX> have reportedly been increasingly interested in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunities .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Time</ENAMEX> executives such as the company 's president , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N.J . Nicholas</ENAMEX> , who will eventually be co-chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Time Warner</ENAMEX> alongside Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> , have no personal relationships or ego at stake in the fight over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> - Peters duo , and were never directly drawn into the fray .
Talks between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides could unravel , of course , as they have more than once since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> announced its plans to hire Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> .
But both sides appear to be more willing now to meet each other 's terms to resolve the issue .
And although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner</ENAMEX> has said it wanted the producers to fulfill the terms of their contract , the producers said in sworn court declarations that they did n't believe the relationship could be repaired after the acrimony of the legal battle .
Any settlement is also expected to exclude Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> from any of the projects they were working on at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> - Peters duo have <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> projects in various stages of development and production at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner</ENAMEX> , including `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bonfire of the Vanities</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Bright Shining Lie</ENAMEX> . ''
But that does n't mean Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> might not eventually get their hands on some of their projects ; studios develop <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of movies but produce <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 10 to 20</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</ENAMEX> .
Once a studio chooses not to actually make a movie that is in development , producers are typically free to take it elsewhere .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> also almost certainly would n't be able to participate in future sequels to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Batman</ENAMEX> , '' the blockbuster hit they produced for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Warner</ENAMEX> .
But in acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Guber - Peters Entertainment</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> will actually get a piece of the profits from `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Batman</ENAMEX> , '' since the publicly held concern gets certain revenue from the movies Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> produce .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> producers own a combined <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</ENAMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Guber - Peters</ENAMEX> .
