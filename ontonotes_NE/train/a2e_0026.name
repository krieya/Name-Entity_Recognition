<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paqueta</ENAMEX> wants to finish <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saad Al - Harthi</ENAMEX> -LRB- the butcher -RRB- in soccer and educationally .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Night Star</ENAMEX>
6 x <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paqueta</ENAMEX>
Away from the club colors and loyalties .. and striving for a explanation and clarification . So far I have not found a convincing explanation for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> incidents involving <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> player , the star <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saad Al - Harthi</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> is the matter of his call up to the national team after he clearly excelled at his club , then being put aside by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paqueta</ENAMEX> , outside the formation , even on the benches in the stadium .
He did not play even as a reserve , nor was he unshackled and returned to complete his university studies of which <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">less than two months</ENAMEX> are left .
Acquiring an education remains the most important , and is the weapon that covers the professional player , especially as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Harthi</ENAMEX> had postponed it more than once , all during his participation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> national team ...!
So read on with me .
Article <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</ENAMEX> , clause <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Professional Regulations</ENAMEX> stipulates .. that the professional player undertakes to continue his education and raise his cultural level
and what supports the need to look into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Harthi 's</ENAMEX> return is that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paqueta</ENAMEX> already has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> strikers beside <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Harthi</ENAMEX> and all of them took part in the last <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> games ...!
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> incident is the report raised by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al - Masibih</ENAMEX> to His Highness the President of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Union</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Harthi 's</ENAMEX> diligence and his readiness to represent the homeland , which raises a wider question mark about why this report concerned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Harthi</ENAMEX> alone ?
Has anything happened in the past that would contradict it ?
The answer from all the fans is , of course , no ..!
Or is there someone who ordered that this report be submitted ..?
What are his motives ..?
I know for sure that someone will summarize everything I referred to above place it in the category of preferences .
And then I will not , will not care , as long as I want to transmit a fact that we are in great need of players who are skilled with their brains and their legs .
So liberate the minds of those with skilled legs so that we would enjoy a generation blessed with a civilization of progress and consciousness and awareness
Let us all repeat together with our hearts before our tongues " Long live the Green , long may it live "
From under the door --
His last title that stuck to him and which he retained is " <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FIFA</ENAMEX> international expert "
So what will he win from the title " the Legend of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Gulf</ENAMEX> " apart from proving the saying " not getting tired of titles " after the overwhelming public popularity ?
What a sad media that which reduced the meeting of our national team with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> to the confrontation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Shlhoub</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalfan</ENAMEX> ..!*
The invisible reason behind Jasim 's decisive victory in getting the " Legend of the Gulf " title is his insistence on thanking the eight media personalities who voted for him !*
A question occurs to me .
How come a player for whom voted 55 % of an awesome number of the public does not get the title , while a player with 45 % is given the title on the basis of no more than eight media personalities voting for him ?
How ?
Since the " one and only " media started criticizing the coach Paqueta heavily .. can we innocently ask here whether this media has become a " middleman " striving for Paqueta 's dismissal and his return to their team ..?
What supports it is the delay in their team contracting a coach ..!
I found the novel -LRB- The Searcher and the Searched For -RRB- clearly in the tyrannical individualism of Al - Shlhoub and al - Qahtani .. and each of them searching for the other ..!
The emblem of the leadership did not suite him -LRB- neither in form mor in content -RRB- *
Paqueta puts his earpiece in his ear and talks on the telephone throughout the match *
This can only have two explanations .
The first is the presence of a technical manager in the stands , -LRB- he was n't there -RRB- ...!
The second is the presence of another person dictating to him while he executes ..!!.
An article copied from the famous writer and the satellite TV voice of Nasr International , Mr. Khaled Al - Shaalan .
This is life as seen by states ....
If it pleased someone for an hour , it made him unhappy for ages .
A Very Ordinary Native Country
Night Star , here is an advice for free : do not try and tire yourself with Khaled Al - Shaalan .
The man suffers from unnatural fanaticism and the problem is that there are those who support him .
If you scrutinized all his articles and his appearance on the channels and his transfer from one channel to another then you would know this man 's disease .
Encouragement is a nice thing .
However fanaticism , the turning of facts on their head , the schadenfreude , the mockery and the lying and innumerable , uncountable issues are present in this sick person ;.
I advised you and it 's your choice .
