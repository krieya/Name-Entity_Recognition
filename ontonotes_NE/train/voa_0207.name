<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Cuban</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel Castro</ENAMEX> is setting up a lavish extravaganza on the island nation to welcome <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the new millennium</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</ENAMEX> late for much of the rest of the world .
Many experts contend most of the world was at least technically wrong by bringing in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the new millennium</ENAMEX> with massive celebrations <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
These experts point out that the Gregorian calendar started in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1 AD</ENAMEX> and therefore , centuries ' millennia start with a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> , not a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</ENAMEX> .
They say this makes <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year of the third millennium</ENAMEX> .
For those observing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of 2001</ENAMEX> as a true dawn of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the twenty - first century</ENAMEX> , the parties and fireworks are fewer and less elaborate than the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</ENAMEX> celebrations .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> though , where President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> had his country sit out <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year 's</ENAMEX> revelry , they 'll be making up for it as major festivities are set .
