If you have money , there 's no need to talk about it .
But among the working class , if a couple 's basic monthly salary was greater by just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one thousand</ENAMEX> or so , the pressure from a mortgage would definitely be a lot less .
In addition , mortgage procedures are becoming increasingly simple and the conditions are also favorable .
Of course , this means to push up housing prices .
My parents have discussed with me whether they should quickly haul out their savings to buy a house .
It 's because my mother says that money is becoming more worthless over the time , especially for the working class like them whose primary income is the salary .
My parents have a few properties and have only rented out one house for business use .
Nowadays , the rent one gets by renting out a house is not high either , so they are n't expecting to earn much from the rent , but rather are hoping the properties will maintain their value .
If they want to buy another property now , they will definitely have to borrow from the bank .
I think perhaps they should wait until next year when housing prices tumble .
Then it will be relatively worthwhile .
Does anybody think that housing prices could fall next year ?
