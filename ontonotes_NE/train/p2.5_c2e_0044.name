<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tmac</ENAMEX> 's problem is actually very simple , that is : do n't be selfish , be motivated .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">KB</ENAMEX> shot <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26</ENAMEX> times , and he 's just had a knee surgery this summer .
Is he really not worried about getting injured again ?
That is being unselfish , and that is being motivated .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tmac</ENAMEX> gets the highest salary in the team , so he should n't care too much about himself .
If he 's like what he is doing right now -- neither willing to break through at the risk of being injured , nor willing to take the responsibility of the last shot on his own shoulders like a real leader of the team -- then we get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tmac</ENAMEX> we 've got now , and we might hate what 's happened to him , but we 're angry that he 's not fighting back .
That <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35</ENAMEX> - second flash of brilliance just proves that he has the ability to create miracles .
A real great star wants to keep on creating miracles , keep on breaking records , and keep on pushing the limits
