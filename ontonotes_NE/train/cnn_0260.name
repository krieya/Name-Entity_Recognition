We 're getting late word <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geraldo Rivera</ENAMEX> may not be be kicked out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> after all .
Originally <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Central Command</ENAMEX> said the veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox News</ENAMEX> correspond was being expelled because he compromised the location of the unit he 's been embedded with .
Now a spokesman from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Central Command</ENAMEX> is saying and I 'm quoting `` Frankly , we have bigger and more important things to do . ''
During a live broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geraldo</ENAMEX> drew a map in the sand showing the location of the unit in relation to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> .
Says he 's not aware he 's being expelled but says if so , it is because some bitter former colleagues of his at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MSNBC</ENAMEX> blew the whistle on him .
It sounds to me like some rats at my former network , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> , are spreading some lies about me .
You know , they ca n't compete fair and square on the battlefield so they 're trying to stab me in the back .
It is not first time .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Central Command</ENAMEX> on the other hand says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivera</ENAMEX> is being kicked out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> because `` he gave away the big picture stuff . ''
All of this now under review , whether or not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geraldo</ENAMEX> stays or goes .
We 'll continue to monitor that front on the store yix another veteran war correspondent is being fired for his controversial conduct in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> is terminating freelancer reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Arnett</ENAMEX> for statements he made to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> media .
We showed you the statements <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
He said the coalition 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> war plan had failed because of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> resistance .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> he appeared on on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today</ENAMEX> '' show and said he was sorry .
I want to apologize to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> people for clearly making a misjudgment over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</ENAMEX> by giving an interview to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> television .
Now , I said in that interview essentially what we all know about the war , there have been delays in implementing policy , there has been surprises , but clearly by giving that interview to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> television , I created a firestorm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> , and for that I am truly sorry .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnett</ENAMEX> had been covering the war for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Geographic</ENAMEX> , which also fired him as TV reports were given exclusively to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MSNBC</ENAMEX> .
Late word from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> that the tabloid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Daily Mirror</ENAMEX> just hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Arnett</ENAMEX> to be its correspondent in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> .
But the question remains Did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Arnett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geraldo Rivera</ENAMEX> cross the line ? or were they within their rights as reporters ?
We posed that question to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Wolf</ENAMEX> , a contributing editor for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">`` New York ''</ENAMEX> magazine , a media columnist , an important article in the new issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">`` New York</ENAMEX> . ''
He 's joining us now live from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> .
What do you say to the question , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> ?
Well , you know , I think I 'm --
