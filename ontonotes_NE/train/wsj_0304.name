The head trader of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical Banking Corp. 's</ENAMEX> interest - rate options group has left the company , following valuation errors that resulted in a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 33 million</ENAMEX> charge against its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">third - quarter</ENAMEX> results .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Edelson</ENAMEX> resigned recently , but <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> individual close to the situation said the resignation was forced .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelson</ENAMEX> could n't be reached for comment .
A separate inquiry by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical</ENAMEX> cleared Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelson</ENAMEX> of allegations that he had been lavishly entertained by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> money broker .
That inquiry has n't resolved similar allegations involving another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical</ENAMEX> options trader .
In other personnel changes stemming from problems in its options unit :
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Kennedy</ENAMEX> , a trader in swaps contracts for the bank , to assume Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelson</ENAMEX> 's duties and to be trading manager for derivative products , including swaps and interest - rate options .
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Wakeman</ENAMEX> , vice president in charge of options research who discovered the valuation errors and was asked by senior management to straighten out the mess , resigned to take a position in asset and liability management at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Continental Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wakeman</ENAMEX> , whom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical</ENAMEX> tried to keep , did n't return calls for comment .
Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical</ENAMEX> confirmed that it took an undisclosed charge in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the second quarter</ENAMEX> for losses on forward - rate agreements involving foreign currency written by its branch in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">second - quarter</ENAMEX> charge was `` not material '' and that no personnel changes were made as a result .
The spokeswoman said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> situation was `` totally different '' from problems in the interest - rate options unit .
According to individuals familiar with the situation , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> loss stemmed from a computer program for calculating prices on forward - rate agreements that failed to envision an interest - rate environment where short - term rates were equal to or higher than long - term rates .
While the incidents involving interest - rate options and forward - rate agreements are unrelated , some observers say they echo a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> incident in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bankers Trust New York Corp.</ENAMEX> restated the value of its foreign exchange options contracts downward by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 80 million</ENAMEX> .
These complex products require close monitoring because each must be valued separately in light of current market conditions .
In an interest - rate options contract , a client pays a fee to a bank for custom - tailored protection against adverse interest - rate swings for a specified period .
In a forward - rate agreement , a client agrees to an exchange rate on a future currency transaction .
Some competitors maintain the interestrate option loss , in particular , may have resulted more from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical</ENAMEX> 's taking large and often contrarian positions than a valuation problem .
Started <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical</ENAMEX> 's interest - rate options group was a leading force in the field .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1987 to 1988</ENAMEX> , the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical</ENAMEX> 's option contracts outstanding mushroomed to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 37 billion</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 billion</ENAMEX> .
More importantly , the volume of options written exceeded those purchased by almost 2 - to - 1 .
With such a lopsided book of options , traders say , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical</ENAMEX> was more vulnerable to erroneous valuation assumptions .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said the bank has examined its methodologies and internal controls .
`` We consider our internal controls to have worked well , '' she said , adding that some procedures have been strengthened .
Its valuation methodologies , she said , `` are recognized as some of the best on the Street .
Not a lot was needed to be done .
