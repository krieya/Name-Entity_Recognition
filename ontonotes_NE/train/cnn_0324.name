Senators and a good teacher believes in the possibilities of every boy and girl .
The good teacher sees what is possible .
A good teacher believes in the responsibility of every school to bring out the best in every student , and 2001 , we passed what 's called the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">No Child Left Behind</ENAMEX> legislation .
I love that phrase , because it 's a commitment of our nation to make sure that not only does every child excel , but no child gets left behind .
Members of both parties , both <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> came together to pass this law .
Inherent in the law is the vision of high standards , and money to meet the standards .
An historic reforms .
All of which put the education decisions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> in the hands of teachers and principals and local officials .
But we also said that as we seek excellence for every child , we must design accountability systems at the state level to determine whether or not each child is learning .
In order to make sure no child gets left behind , we must understand whether or not each child is learning to read and write and add and subtract .
If there are , there will be plenty of praise .
If not , we will work to design programs to make sure no child gets left behind .
That 's the crux of the law .
Every state met the law 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 31st</ENAMEX> deadline for submitting their accountability plans for approval .
I 'm pleased to announce that Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Page</ENAMEX> has approved plans from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington State</ENAMEX> , which bring the -- which bring the total number of approved plans to 16 covering <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 million</ENAMEX> children in public schools across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> .
Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Page</ENAMEX> and his department will continue working with the rest of the states to get the plans approved as quickly as possible .
People are responding to the challenge at the local level .
People are beginning to develop the accountability systems to show your states and your communities that you 're doing your job , leaving no doubt in the minds of the parents and taxpayers and citizens , some of whom praise public schools , some are critical of public schools , that you 're performing .
They will understand why you 're here being honored in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> as one of the top <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</ENAMEX> teachers around our country .
Education reform depends on good laws and good plans but you and I know it ultimately depends on good teachers .

By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this September</ENAMEX> , states will assess the programs they expect to make by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2006 school year</ENAMEX> .
