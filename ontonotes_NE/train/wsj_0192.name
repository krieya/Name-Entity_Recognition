The record corn - buying binge by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> is causing serious bottlenecks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> grain pipeline .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling to find enough river barges and trains to move the recently harvested <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Midwest</ENAMEX> crop to ports for loading onto <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> ships .
River barge rates have soared <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> this fall from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> .
Railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business .
And some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</ENAMEX> as exporters scrounge to find enough of the crop to meet their obligations to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Soviet Union</ENAMEX> bought <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly 310 million bushels</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> corn in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> , which is the most ever sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Soviet Union</ENAMEX> wants much of it delivered by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> , which would be a strain in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">most years</ENAMEX> .
But it is particularly difficult <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this autumn</ENAMEX> because of low water levels on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Mississippi River</ENAMEX> , on which flows much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> corn that is shipped overseas .
`` We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Dunton</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> transportation expert .
`` It is going to be real tight . ''
Because of persistent dry weather in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the northern Plains</ENAMEX> , the water level on the upper section of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Mississippi River</ENAMEX> is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges their tows push at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> time .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</ENAMEX> , many barges probably wo n't be able to operate fully loaded south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</ENAMEX> is beginning to reduce the flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Missouri River</ENAMEX> , which feeds into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Mississippi River</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Army Corps</ENAMEX> is cutting the flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Missouri River</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about two weeks earlier</ENAMEX> than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it .
Barge rates on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Mississippi River</ENAMEX> sank <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> on speculation that widespread rain <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Midwest</ENAMEX> might temporarily alleviate the situation .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Army Corps of Engineers</ENAMEX> expects the river level to continue falling <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</ENAMEX> .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX> , the water level of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Mississippi River</ENAMEX> is already <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.5 feet</ENAMEX> below normal and it could drop <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an additional 2.5 feet</ENAMEX> when the flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Missouri River</ENAMEX> is slowed , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Army Corps</ENAMEX> spokesman said .
Similar levels hamstrung barge shipments <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> in the wake of the worst drought in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</ENAMEX> .
So far , the grain industry 's budding logistical problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> .
Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Board of Trade</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> the price of the corn contract for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> delivery slipped <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.5 cents</ENAMEX> a bushel to settle at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.375</ENAMEX> a bushel .
Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> drought .
With the harvest winding down , however , some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver .
Farmers are in the best position of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</ENAMEX> to push up corn prices .
Because the drought reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> stockpiles , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise .
In parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> , for example , some grain elevators are offering farmers $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.15</ENAMEX> a bushel for corn .
Many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least 20 cents</ENAMEX> a bushel , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyle Reed</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chicago Central -AMP- Pacific Railroad Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waterloo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> .
It is n't clear , however , who would win a waiting game .
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> corn stockpiles shrank by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly half</ENAMEX> in the wake of the drought , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> projects that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly one - fifth</ENAMEX> of the harvest will still be in storage before the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> corn harvest begins .
Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation .
`` The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Biedermann</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Allendale Inc.</ENAMEX> research director .
Although much of this country 's export corn goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> by barge , it is possible for exporters to sidestep <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Mississippi River</ENAMEX> by shipping a larger - than - normal amount of corn by train to the port .
Ports in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Atlantic Coast</ENAMEX> can also relieve pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> railroad , for example , is already increasing its grain hauling service from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> .
And it is n't clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> will stay on its record buying pace .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> orders were compressed into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the month of October</ENAMEX> because of delays .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Soviet Union</ENAMEX> usually begins buying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> crops earlier in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fall</ENAMEX> .
But its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems .
In other commodity markets <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> :
ENERGY : Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading , but much of the action was in heating oil .
Prices rose on the news that a sizable <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">West German</ENAMEX> refinery was damaged in a fire , tightening an already tight <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> market .
Heating oil for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> delivery ended at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">58.64 cents</ENAMEX> a gallon , up <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">one cent</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">West Texas Intermediate</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> delivery advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">22 cents</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">19.94</ENAMEX> a barrel .
Gasoline futures continued a sell - off that began <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> .
PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> delivery gold fell $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.20</ENAMEX> an ounce to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">377.60</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> silver declined <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.50 cents</ENAMEX> an ounce to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.2180</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> platinum was down $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.70</ENAMEX> an ounce at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">494.50</ENAMEX> .
Precious metals , gold in particular , currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William O'Neill</ENAMEX> , vice president of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Elders Futures</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
`` The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities , '' he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , the stock market rose strongly , creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders , he said .
Silver and platinum , which have more of an industrial nature than gold , were even weaker , he said .
Silver is also under pressure of `` extremely high '' inventories in warehouses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> , he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , these stocks rose by <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">170,262 ounces</ENAMEX> to a record of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">226,570,380 ounces</ENAMEX> , according to an exchange spokesman .
COPPER : Futures prices partially recovered <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> 's declines because <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chilean</ENAMEX> miners voted to strike .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> contract rose <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.20 cents</ENAMEX> a pound to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.14</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chile</ENAMEX> , workers at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> copper mines , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Los Bronces</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Soldado</ENAMEX> , which belong to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Exxon</ENAMEX> - owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Minera Disputada</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> voted to begin a full strike tomorrow , an analyst said .
Reasons for the walkout , the analyst said , included a number of procedural issues , such as a right to strike .
The analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks .
In the case of copper , he said , the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal .
Also contributing to the firmness in copper , the analyst noted , was a report by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> purchasing agents , which precedes the full purchasing agents ' report that is due out <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> and gives an indication of what the full report might hold .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Purchasing Management Association of Chicago</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> index rose to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51.6 %</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three previous months</ENAMEX> of readings below <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> index was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47.1 %</ENAMEX> .
A reading below <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy , while a reading above <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> points to expansion .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> report raised the possibility that the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October</ENAMEX> survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Association of Purchasing Management</ENAMEX> would also show a reading above <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> .
