<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Up to 20</ENAMEX> people have been killed in a massacre by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Colombian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Marxist</ENAMEX> guerillas .
The tactics are more commonly associated with right - wing paramilitaries , but as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremy Mcdermott</ENAMEX> reports , the guerillas now seem to be adopting them too .
Everybody was watching the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbia</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Paraguay</ENAMEX> football match when guerillas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Falk</ENAMEX> swept into several hamlets in the south - western province of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kalca</ENAMEX> .
Mirroring the tactics of the right - wing death squads , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Falk</ENAMEX> arrived in the communities with lists in hand and dragged those they found on the list into the street and executed them .
The paramilitaries have long used the policy of massacres to cut away support for their guerilla enemies .
The guerillas are now adopting the same tactics as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Colombian</ENAMEX> civil conflict enters <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">its 37th year</ENAMEX> .
