`` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Cosby Show</ENAMEX> '' may have single - handedly turned around ratings at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> since its debut in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huxtable</ENAMEX> family still keeps <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</ENAMEX> of viewers laughing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> on the network .
But some of the TV stations that bought `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cosby</ENAMEX> '' reruns for record prices <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> are n't laughing much <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> .
The reruns have helped ratings at many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">187</ENAMEX> network affiliates and independent TV stations that air the shows .
But the ratings are considerably below expectations , and some stations say they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire .
Meanwhile , stations are fuming because , many of them say , the show 's distributor , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Viacom Inc.</ENAMEX> , is giving an ultimatum : Either sign new long - term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cosby</ENAMEX> '' to a competitor .
At the same time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Viacom</ENAMEX> is trying to persuade stations to make commitments to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Different World</ENAMEX> , '' a spin - off of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cosby</ENAMEX> '' whose reruns will become available in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Viacom</ENAMEX> denies it 's using pressure tactics .
`` We 're willing to negotiate , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Gillespie</ENAMEX> , executive vice president of marketing .
`` We 're offering this plan now because we feel it 's the right time . ''
But , says the general manager of a network affiliate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Midwest</ENAMEX> , `` I think if I tell them I need more time , they 'll take ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cosby</ENAMEX> ' across the street , ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Viacom</ENAMEX> 's move comes as the syndication market is being flooded with situation comedies that are still running on the networks .
One station manager says he believes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Viacom</ENAMEX> 's move is a `` pre-emptive strike '' because the company is worried that `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cosby</ENAMEX> '' ratings will continue to drop in syndication over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few years</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cosby</ENAMEX> '' is down a full ratings point in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the week of Oct. 2 - 8</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the same week a year ago</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">A.C. Nielsen Co</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillespie</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Viacom</ENAMEX> says the ratings are rising .
And executives at stations in such major markets as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Providence</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">R.I.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raleigh</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.C.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ky.</ENAMEX> , say they may very well not renew `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cosby</ENAMEX> . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Lobo</ENAMEX> , the general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WTVJ</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> - owned station in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> , for example , says the show has `` been a major disappointment to us . ''
`` At the prices we were charged , there should have been some return for the dollar .
There was n't . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Kuvin</ENAMEX> , the general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WHAS</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> affiliate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisville</ENAMEX> , says `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cosby</ENAMEX> '' gets the station 's highest ratings and he 's `` pleased . ''
But he adds , `` I feel pressured , disappointed , uncomfortable and , frankly , quite angry with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Viacom</ENAMEX> .
