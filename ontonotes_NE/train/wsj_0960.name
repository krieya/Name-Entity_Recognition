The recent bids for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Airlines</ENAMEX> have led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline managements .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> is scheduled to vote <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> on an anti-airline - takeover bill that would block , for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 50 days</ENAMEX> , any bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</ENAMEX> or more of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> airline , even a straight cash purchase .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Transportation</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Skinner</ENAMEX> , who earlier fueled the anti-takeover fires with his quasi-xenophobic attacks on foreign investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> carriers , now says the bill would further disturb the jittery capital markets .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Bartlett</ENAMEX> , who has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Airlines</ENAMEX> workers in his district , says the bill is `` good politics , but bad law . ''
It is ironic that at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's partial airline deregulation is being emulated by governments from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> , so many in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> favor an incumbent - protection program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> airline , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> .
