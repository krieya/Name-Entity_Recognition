<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Common Cause</ENAMEX> asked both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Ethics Committee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> to investigate <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</ENAMEX> in political gifts by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> businessman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Keating</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> senators who interceded with thrift - industry regulators for him .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> is currently the subject of a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 billion</ENAMEX> federal anti-racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> thrift he controlled , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lincoln Savings -AMP- Loan Association</ENAMEX> , and driving it into insolvency .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Wertheimer</ENAMEX> -- president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Common Cause</ENAMEX> , the self - styled citizens lobby -- said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> Sens. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis DeConcini</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Cranston</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Glenn</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Riegle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wertheimer</ENAMEX> based this on a statement by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> that was quoted in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> story in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April</ENAMEX> : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> question ... had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause .
I want to say in the most forceful way I can : I certainly hope so . ''
In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeConcini</ENAMEX> 's office in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1987</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> senators asked federal regulators to ease up on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lincoln</ENAMEX> .
According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting , the regulators said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lincoln</ENAMEX> was gambling dangerously with depositors ' federally insured money and was `` a ticking time bomb . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> had complained that the regulators were being too zealous .
The notes show that Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeConcini</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 's</ENAMEX> regulations `` grossly unfair , '' and that Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> insisted that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> 's thrift was `` viable and profitable . ''
For <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next two years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bank Board</ENAMEX> , which at the time was the agency responsible for regulating thrifts , failed to act -- even after federal auditors warned in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1987</ENAMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> had caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lincoln</ENAMEX> to become insolvent .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lincoln</ENAMEX> 's parent company , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Continental Corp.</ENAMEX> , entered bankruptcy - law proceedings <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this April 13</ENAMEX> , and regulators seized the thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</ENAMEX> .
The newly formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX> , successor to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bank Board</ENAMEX> , filed suit against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> and several others on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 15</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> has filed his own suit , alleging that his property was taken illegally .
The cost to taxpayers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lincoln</ENAMEX> 's collapse has been estimated at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 2.5 billion</ENAMEX> .
Details of the affair have become public gradually over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</ENAMEX> , mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers .
In the midst of his <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> re-election campaign , Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riegle</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Banking Committee</ENAMEX> , returned $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">76,000</ENAMEX> in contributions after a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> newspaper said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> had gathered the money for him <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about two weeks</ENAMEX> before the meeting with regulators .
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeConcini</ENAMEX> , after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> of fending off intense press criticism , returned $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">48,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only last month</ENAMEX> , shortly after the government formally accused Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> of defrauding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lincoln</ENAMEX> .
In addition , Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> disclosed that he belatedly had paid $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">13,433</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Continental</ENAMEX> as reimbursement for trips he and his family took aboard the corporate jet to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> 's vacation home at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cat Cay</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1984 through 1986</ENAMEX> .
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter `` fell between the cracks . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> , his family members and associates also donated $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">112,000</ENAMEX> to Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> 's congressional campaigns over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</ENAMEX> , according to press accounts .
But Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> broke off their friendship abruptly in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , because the senator refused to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> wanted .
`` He became very angry at that , left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp , '' Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> recalls .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> newspapers disclosed that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> gave $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">850,000</ENAMEX> in corporate funds to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> tax - exempt voter registration organizations in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> at the behest of Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX> , who conceded that soliciting the money was `` a pretty stupid thing to do politically . ''
In addition , Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX> received $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">47,000</ENAMEX> in campaign donations through Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> party received $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">85,000</ENAMEX> in corporate donations for a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> get - out - the - vote drive that benefited the senator 's re-election campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</ENAMEX> .
Also in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> newspapers disclosed $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">200,000</ENAMEX> in corporate donations by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Council on Public Policy</ENAMEX> , a political committee controlled by Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> .
That was in addition to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">34,000</ENAMEX> in direct campaign donations arranged by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> senator .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wertheimer</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Ethics Committee</ENAMEX> should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation , as was done in the case of former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Wright</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson Abney</ENAMEX> , staff director of the ethics panel , would n't comment .
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riegle</ENAMEX> said he would cooperate with any inquiry , but that his conduct had been `` entirely proper . ''
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> said he had been `` deeply concerned '' at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper , but decided it was `` entirely appropriate '' for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent .
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and `` I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Senate Ethics Committee</ENAMEX> . ''
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeConcini</ENAMEX> said , `` When all is said and done , I expect to be fully exonerated . ''
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX> , who had already volunteered his help to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Bureau of Investigation</ENAMEX> in any investigation of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> , portrayed his role in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> as prodding regulators to act .
`` Why did n't <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bank Board</ENAMEX> act sooner ? '' he said .
`` That is what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Common Cause</ENAMEX> should ask be investigated .
