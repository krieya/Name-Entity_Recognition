President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has signed into law a bill allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> exports of food and medicine to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> .
Nevertheless , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> says he is not satisfied with the measure .
It purports to allow the export of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> products to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> , yet it makes it virtually impossible for family farmers to arrange the financing that enables such sales to take place .
The new law bars the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> government and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> banks from providing funds for such exports at the insistence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> 's congressional critics .
The law also prevents Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> or his successor from easing restrictions on travel to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communist</ENAMEX> country .
