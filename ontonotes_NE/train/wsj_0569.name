If a TV weatherman gets butterflies facing the camera again after a questionable forecast , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald H. Straszheim</ENAMEX> surely understands .
The chief economist of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> finds himself in such a position as he buzzes the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Midwest</ENAMEX> on his first road trip since backpedaling on a major prediction .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> expects he will take some heat , and he 's right .
Since the last time he traveled this way <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several months ago</ENAMEX> , he has recanted a series of bold forecasts of a recession .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1988</ENAMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> commentary announced that `` the economy is likely to fall into recession in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1989</ENAMEX> . ''
The forecasts were widely disseminated , and , in a splashy ad campaign launched in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1988</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> urged investors to buy bonds .
It said long - term interest rates , then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above 9 %</ENAMEX> , could drop to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 1989</ENAMEX> , so bonds , which benefit from falling rates , would be a good buy .
The firm also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 %</ENAMEX> and later to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 %</ENAMEX> .
But this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> -- just when many market economists , including some at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> , believed that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> was about to be proved right -- he took a detour if not a U-turn .
He softened the talk about a recession .
Now , in fact , he is predicting economic growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.9 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.1 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> , a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some four dozen</ENAMEX> top forecasters surveyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Blue Chip Economic Indicators</ENAMEX> newsletter .
And , just recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> cut the recommended bondholdings back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> .
While such changes might sound minor , they are n't : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> manages or oversees <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 300 billion</ENAMEX> in retail accounts that include everything from mutual funds to individual annuities .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> well - known colleagues who believe Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> was right the first time are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Bostian Jr.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Gary Shilling</ENAMEX> , both of whom run their own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> research firms .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bostian</ENAMEX> said in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> that his macroeconomic index signaled recession .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shilling</ENAMEX> , who was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch 's</ENAMEX> chief economist from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</ENAMEX> , has heralded a recession for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> .
`` My own personal opinion is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don</ENAMEX> threw in the towel just about the time he should have doubled his bet , '' he says .
Now a rocky stock market and weak corporate profits may further threaten the economy .
And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> conceded after a recent drop in manufacturing jobs that `` it may prove to be the case that we got whipsawed -- that we pulled the recession forecast at just the wrong time . ''
He adds , `` That 's the forecasting business . ''
However risky the business , it 's brisk <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> .
Pestered by bosses , brokers , clients and media people and pushed by their own egos , Wall Street economists are forecasting about everything from broad economic trends to the dinkiest <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> indicator .
But the surprisingly durable <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven - year</ENAMEX> economic expansion has made mincemeat of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</ENAMEX> forecast .
This is n't the quiet economic science practiced in the universities .
This is the commercial version .
Carrying the new message on the road , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> meets confrontation that often occurs in inverse proportion to the size of the client .
No sophisticated professional expects economists to be right all the time .
Some smaller clients do n't seem to notice his switch .
But with some clients , the talk can heat up a bit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis O'Brien</ENAMEX> , the treasurer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Commonwealth Edison Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> , adopts a polite approach , waiting for an opportunity to ask about the forecast .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">A good half - hour</ENAMEX> into breakfast at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Palmer House</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Brien</ENAMEX> looks up from his plate after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> says something about people who believe interest rates are about to nosedive .
`` I 'm <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of them who hope they will , with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion</ENAMEX> in debt on the books .
Is that the forecast ? '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Brien</ENAMEX> asks , trying to pin down the economist .
He does n't fully succeed , although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> lists an array of interest - rate scenarios .
In a chilly conference room at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Alliance Capital Management</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> , in contrast , the firm 's money managers seem ready to pin Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> to the wall .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Harrison</ENAMEX> , the manager , shoves Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> 's handout back at him : `` Do we want to go through this ?
Or can we ask you why you changed your forecast just when it 's about to be right ? ''
Swiveling in his chair , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> replies that the new outlook , though still weak , does n't justify calling a recession right now . ``
It 's all in this handout you do n't want to look at .
We could still have a recession '' at some point .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> 's recurring themes is that the state of the economy is n't a simple black or white .
Sometimes , like now , it 's gray .
This somewhat - ambiguous assessment moves <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Alliance</ENAMEX> portfolio manager to ask : `` So , what is this -- a Stealth recession ? ''
Another challenges <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch 's</ENAMEX> bond recommendation <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
`` We 're not running that ad campaign any more , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> snaps in a rare show of irritation .
He adds , `` I think it was a fairly decent call . ''
Explaining his change of mind , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> says later , `` It 's hard to pin this on one factor . ''
He says the economy , and especially the employment numbers , look much better than he expected ; interest rates have generally declined ; inflation has n't run amok .
`` Our business is constantly looking at all these things , '' he says .
His new forecast calls for `` a soft landing . ''
And it may be right , judging from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week 's</ENAMEX> report that inflation - adjusted gross national product rose at a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rate in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third quarter</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shilling</ENAMEX> understands Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> 's problems .
`` There 's unbelievable pressure on economists to forecast these numbers , '' he says . ``
You make a forecast , and then you become its prisoner . ''
It is indeed hard to back away from a widely publicized forecast , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> is fidgeting with the handcuffs on this trip .
His approach to the recantation is direct but low - key .
`` For some time , we had forecast negative <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">third - and fourth - quarter</ENAMEX> growth .
We pulled that forecast , '' he begins matter - of - factly in a meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Piper , Jaffray -AMP- Hopwood Inc.</ENAMEX> officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> , the first stop .
