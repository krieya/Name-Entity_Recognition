<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> has been critical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration for not sending enough aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> , so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> to assist its legislature , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sejm</ENAMEX> , in democratic procedures .
Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Domenici</ENAMEX> calls this effort `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> gift of democracy . ''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Poles</ENAMEX> might do better to view it as a Trojan Horse .
It is the vast shadow government of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</ENAMEX> congressional staffers that helps create such legislative atrocities as the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,376</ENAMEX> page , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 - pound</ENAMEX> reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> .
Maybe after the staffers explain their work to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Poles</ENAMEX> , they 'd be willing to come back and do the same for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> people .
