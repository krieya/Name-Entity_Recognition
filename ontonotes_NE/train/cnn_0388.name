We now return to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">People in the News</ENAMEX> . ''
Reporter :
For <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Stewart</ENAMEX> seems business is everything , and everywhere .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> has found the road to fortune wherever she has traveled .
I think the temptation for any successful entrepreneur to go global .
Reporter :
Her marketing vision also included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KMart</ENAMEX> a company that recently emerged from bankruptcy .
Okay , girls .
Reporter :
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> is associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kmart</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> and been very successful .
The goal had been to bring affordable style to the masse .
There 's a reason she was successful , and the stuff that she 's created people like .
It 's good , it 's useful , it 's appealing , it 's attractive and it 's cheap .
Reporter :
Even as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kmart</ENAMEX> struggled through financial difficulties , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> stuck by the company .
It 's hard to run out on a partner that 's down .
That 's not our style .
Reporter :
Now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> is hoping people do n't run out on her .
The celebrity indicted on charges stemming from the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ImClone</ENAMEX> stock .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ImClone</ENAMEX> CEO <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Waksal</ENAMEX> shared a broker who now also faces charges of obstruction of justice and perjury .
Her defense has been that she had a standing sell order at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">60</ENAMEX> and when the stock fell below <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</ENAMEX> the broker was supposed to , you know make the trade .
She 's been standing with that story .
The broker standing by that story .
The only reason it 's not holding is because there are other people that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> that investigated and did n't find proof that was actually the case .
Reporter :
After <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> was charged by federal authorities <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> , her lawyers issued a statement in which they said , quote , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Stewart</ENAMEX> has done nothing wrong .
The accusation that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Stewart</ENAMEX> sold the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ImClone</ENAMEX> shares based on inside information proved to be false .
If she lied , then that is the obstruction of justice charge .
That 's the criminal side .
That 's where the prison time comes in .
Reporter :
For <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> , the fallout from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</ENAMEX> taken a tremendous toll .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Stewart</ENAMEX> told me that the investigation itself had cost her <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 400 million</ENAMEX> , in decline in her stock , legal fees , and lost business opportunities .
Reporter :
Ironic , considering the sale of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ImClone</ENAMEX> stock resulted in a gain of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 50,000</ENAMEX> .
She 'll never fully recover .
You know , it 's almost like e.g. you get off the hook , but are you really off the hook because people always believe you were guilty .
And it 's hard to win back that sort of brand equity that she 's lost .
Reporter :
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> is vowing to clear her name of the charges .
She is so focused and so determined that this investigation , while terribly upsetting , has not been something that 's stood in her way .
As only she would , she said , Look , I do n't lose any sleep .
I still sleep my <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">three or four hours</ENAMEX> a night .
Reporter :
He says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> is still taken aback by the reaction to her legal troubles .
I think she 's been stunned at how much joy so many people have taken at her misfortune .
She does n't quite understand that the perfectionism that made her so famous also makes people say , Oh , is n't it fun to see someone like that have a big , big problem ?
Reporter :
A perfectionism reflected in even the smallest details of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> 's life .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX> does n't like to talk about how unpleasant things have been , but you can get signals of it in surprising ways .
When we sat down to lunch , she had put out these beautiful chop sticks which I commented on .
She said , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , the person with the thinnest chop sticks has the highest social status , and of course , I had to get the thinnest chop sticks .
Then she paused and said , That 's why people hate me .
Reporter :
Love her or hate her , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Stewart</ENAMEX> has tied every aspect of her image to her business .
Even her daily calendar turned into a marketing tool .
She said to me once that my life is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">`` The Truman Show ''</ENAMEX> and meant I 'm always on .
From the time I get up until I go to bed , the whole world is watching .
Hello , everyone .
Did you --
