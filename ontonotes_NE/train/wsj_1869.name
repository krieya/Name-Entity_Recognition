<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> have settled on a proposal that would cut the capital - gains tax for individuals and corporations .
At the same time , a small group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon .
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Packwood</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ore.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the lead sponsor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GOP</ENAMEX> proposal , said he intends to unveil the plan <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along , particularly this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">month</ENAMEX> 's bill to raise the federal borrowing limit .
He gave <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> - to - 1 odds that a capital - gains tax cut of some sort would be approved <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , though it probably wo n't be included in the pending deficit - reduction bill .
He added that he expects to talk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> who also wanted to cut the gains tax about drafting a joint proposal .
For individuals , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> plan would exclude from income <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than one year</ENAMEX> .
The exclusion would rise <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> percentage points for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</ENAMEX> the asset was held until it reached a maximum of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</ENAMEX> .
The exclusion would apply to assets sold after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 1 , 1989</ENAMEX> .
As an alternative , he said , taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index .
For corporations , the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than three years</ENAMEX> would be cut to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</ENAMEX> from the current top rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34 %</ENAMEX> .
That rate would gradually decline to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as little as 29 %</ENAMEX> for corporate assets held for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> plan would also include a proposal , designed by Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Roth</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Del.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX> plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax - free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> home and to pay education and medical expenses .
Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs but would be subject to tax .
For their part , the group of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> are working on a plan that , like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> proposal , would grant larger exclusions to assets the longer they were held by individuals and companies .
Newly acquired assets would get a bigger break than those currently held .
An extra exclusion would be given to long - held stock in small and medium - size corporations just starting up .
No one in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> is considering the capital - gains plan passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> .
That plan would provide a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> exclusion to assets sold over a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2 1/2 - year</ENAMEX> period ending <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 31 , 1991</ENAMEX> .
After then , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> measure would boost the tax rate to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</ENAMEX> and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation .
Senators are focusing on making a capital - gains differential permanent .
Separately , Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ill</ENAMEX> . -RRB- of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> said he did n't want the capital - gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit .
The current debt limit expires <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 31</ENAMEX> .
He also urged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> negotiators to rid the deficit - reduction bill of all provisions that increase the budget deficit , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">House</ENAMEX> - passed capital - gains provision .
