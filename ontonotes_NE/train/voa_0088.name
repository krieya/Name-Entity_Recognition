With just <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</ENAMEX> left until the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> presidential election , both major party candidates campaigned in regions that could go either way .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W Bush</ENAMEX> campaigned in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> , a state with a large population of retired people .
I need your help .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last days</ENAMEX> of this campaign , I need you all to work your neighborhoods and talk to your friends and turn out to vote .
And while <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> campaigned in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> campaigned for him in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> , another state where the election is too close to call .
If you kind of like having safer streets and a cleaner environment , and knowing your national government is supporting school reforms at work and helping more people get access to health care while we grow the economy , you got to vote for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Lieberman</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> also said that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> could even determine the outcome of the election nationally .
