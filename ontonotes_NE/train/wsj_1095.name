<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Cox 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 13</ENAMEX> editorial - page article `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Toward More Crippling Lawsuits</ENAMEX> ... '' misses the point .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Americans With Disabilities Act</ENAMEX> is about eliminating discriminatory barriers .
When we look closely at our own history , it is clear that our constitutionally mandated civil rights have evolved not through the goodness of people 's hearts but through legislation and constitutional amendments .
This is how <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> women won the right to vote .
And it is how <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">African - Americans</ENAMEX> and other minority groups were guaranteed their equal rights as citizens in this nation .
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 43 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> with disabilities , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Americans With Disabilities Act</ENAMEX> provides the missing piece .
Disabled <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> have had their civil rights guaranteed in all federally funded programs since <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 504</ENAMEX> was passed as a part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Rehabilitation Act</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> act simply extends these guarantees to the private sector .
Those who fear a plethora of suits paralyzing our legal system need only look at the record on <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Rehabilitation Act</ENAMEX> .
Without legal recourse , there are no guarantees of civil rights for anyone .
