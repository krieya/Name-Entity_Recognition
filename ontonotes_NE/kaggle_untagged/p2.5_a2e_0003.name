I can not assume the personality a Lebanese , especially one from Hezbollah , but I will describe some of the daily features of the demonstrations .
The crowd mixture of demonstrations is made up of Shiite Lebanese and some Christian followers of Aoun .
Of course , we do not forget our Syrian brothers .
A demonstrator is paid the sum of twenty American dollars daily , equivalent to 75 riyals per day .
If we multiply that by 30 days , it would be equivalent to the salary of a Saudi employee in a phone kiosk , maybe more .
You do the math .
It is notable that the demonstrations came just in time to ruin the holiday season in Lebanon , especially in the area of central Beirut , known by the Saudis as Solidaire .
Investments in Solidaire are by Christians and Sunni Muslims .
There are no Shiite investments , neither in tourism nor in Solidaire .
Their investments are only in the mountain restaurants on the South .
Our Gulf brothers are afraid to eat in Shiite restaurants .
The timing of the July war came at the beginning of the tourist season .
Parking lots in Solidaire turned into camps .
The time of demonstrations came in winter , so the demonstrators needed heat .
They could only find wood in the public parks , which were totally ruined .
Lebanese people gather in the evening around water - pipes , and a majority of them smoke hashish .
Syrians line up with carts selling bread and eggs .
Look at the female demonstrators from Hezbollah .
They look like they are from an actress ' agency .
Imagine how the mercenary hashish - smoking demonstrators might bring down the government .
I will return , God willing , with the latest field reports , the subject is not political .
