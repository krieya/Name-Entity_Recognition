The same part of the world , high winds , high seas , three fishermen rescued near Vancouver by a Royal Caribbean cruise ship .
The men held on the sinking vessel until the passenger ship was able to reach them .
A cruise line spokesman said if it were not for the fisherman 's protective suits , they probably would not have stayed warm enough to survive .
The same part of the world in which we had that other incident the other day , about 52 degrees that water temp .
That is chilly .
