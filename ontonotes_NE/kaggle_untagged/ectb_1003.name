Early in December the China Textile In - stitute , located at Tucheng in Taipei County , celebrated its 40th anniversary with a dynamic multimedia show .
The CTI 's 40 - year history has borne witness to the rise and decline of Taiwan 's textile industry .
Forty years ago , Taiwan was just crossing the threshold of industrialization .
The textile industry was the darling of the nation , just like the electronics industry today .
Although it has lost its former kudos , the textile industry is still an indispensable part of Taiwan 's industrial landscape .
For the last decade , the CTI has been working hand in hand with the industry , quietly sowing the seeds of research and development in many places .
Can those seeds germinate to create a second spring for Taiwan 's textile industry ?
As the latest bout of winter weather hits Taiwan , do you want to go up Mt. Hehuan to see the snow ?
You could put on a jacket containing highly insulating melt - spun ceramic fibers .
When the wind sends a fine driving rain slanting across the water , are you still unwilling to forgo the pleasure of sea angling ?
Why not wear some micropore breathable rainwear , with an outer layer which is completely waterproof , but an inner layer which is dry and comfortable on the skin ?
Tencel , made from wood cellulose , has given the lie to the notion that man - made fibers never degrade , and is set to become one of the most important fibers of the coming environmental century ; and the shrimp and crab shells which were once tossed away are now being processed to extract chitin , which when used to treat clothing can inhibit bacteria and mold and prevent unwanted odors , and which can also be used as a dressing for burns which both reduces inflammation and encourages new tissue growth . . . .
What sunset industry ?
Ceramic fibers , stainless steel , shrimp shells - at first glance there seems to be no connection with spinning and weaving .
But in fact these are among the latest products and trends quietly taking shape in the textile industry .
With the rise of new industries such as electronics , aerospace and biotechnology , the areas of application for textile products have expanded ever wider , from being simply coverings for the human body to finding their way up into space and down into the earth .
" There are only sunset products , not sunset industries . "
These words from competitiveness guru Michael Porter hit the nail on the head when it comes to Taiwan 's textile industry 's current efforts to transform itself into a high - tech , capital - and information - intensive sector .
" Twenty years ago , the polyester uniforms worn by schoolchildren in Taiwan turned dreadfully stiff when you tried to wash them ; cotton clothes shrank ; nylon made your skin red and itchy ; stockings would ladder if you so much as looked at them ; and decent clothes had to be expensively dry cleaned , " recalls CTI president Yao Hsing - chuan .
If clothes in Taiwan today are getting ever lighter , softer , warmer , more wrinkle - free and easier to keep clean , and if their colors are bright , fresh and stain - resistant , this is not thanks to the magic wand wielded by Cinderella 's fairy godmother , but is the result of the unceasing efforts towards research , development and upgrading put in by the textile industry over the years .
" Upgrading " has been a word on the lips of everyone in the textile industry in recent years .
But the adverse environment in which the industry has had to operate has made the pace of that upgrading halting and hesitant .
" In the early 1980s , making ready - to - wear garments for export was pretty much a sure - fire money - spinner .
Everything sold like hot cakes , just like electronics today , " says Yao Hsing - chuan .
But around 1987 , under strong US pressure , the NT dollar appreciated , and exporters lost their competitive price advantage .
Next , there was a series of rises in land and labor costs .
Garment making is labor - intensive , and the combination of internal and external pressures led to wholesale factory closures .
Many firms moved production to mainland China or Southeast Asia , and Taiwan 's remaining domestic textile industry was dramatically reshuffled .
With the departure of the ready - to - wear industry , Taiwan lost its " garment kingdom " status .
But looking from another perspective , the Taiwanese manufacturers who spread all over Southeast Asia , mainland China and Latin America were still very much a force to be reckoned with , and in their new locations they continued to source raw materials and semi-finished goods from Taiwan .
With their support , the upstream portions of the industry - fiber making , yarn spinning , weaving , dyeing , finishing and garment design - were able to stay in Taiwan and prosper .
In September 1998 , while the industry was still reeling from the effects of the Asian financial crisis , construction began of the long - planned specialist industrial parks in Yunlin and Changhua Counties .
These were the peak of the large investments made in Taiwan 's textile industry over recent years .
But overcapacity and shrinking demand caused by the crisis had hit the industry hard .
By mid-1999 things were looking up again , but then massive power failures in the wake of the 21 September earthquake wiped out nearly NT$ 10 billion worth of textile orders .
Taiwan 's biggest currency earner
Nevertheless , thanks to its solid foundations built up over 40 years , the textile industry is still a pillar of Taiwan 's economy .
In 1999 , Taiwan 's textile exports are expected to be worth US$ 14.5 billion or 12 % of the island 's total exports , behind only electronics -LRB- 17.6 % -RRB- and IT / telecom products -LRB- 12.3 % -RRB- .
Moreover , after deducting the cost of imported raw materials etc. , the textile industry is Taiwan 's biggest foreign currency earner , bringing in over US$ 10 billion each year .
For instance , polyester is the most widely used man - made fiber , and little Taiwan produces no less than 17 % of the total worldwide supply , making it the largest supplier .
The island 's total production of man - made fibers ranks third globally , behind the USA and mainland China .
At present , the largest category among Taiwan 's textile exports is finished cloth , which accounts for more than 60 % of Taiwan 's textile exports by value .
" The textile industry has deep roots in Taiwan , and there are many processes to be gone through from the fiber to the finished garment .
Thus there are many key technologies which can be developed , and the industry can sustain a large workforce . "
CTI acting vice-president Wu Chung - fu observes that the advanced countries still devote substantial efforts to developing textile technologies , and naturally this is something Taiwan should not lightly give up .
We ca n't give it up , but neither can we rest on our laurels .
With Southeast Asia and mainland China catching up fast , Taiwan 's textile industry will only have a future if it can quickly transform itself and develop towards high - tech products .
The CTI , which a decade ago began a timely change in its role to one of a specialist R-AMP-D center working in partnership with firms , has become the leading R-AMP-D center for Taiwan 's several thousand textile industry companies .
The development of new " nylon 66 " fibers is a case in point .
Grace Kuo , a vice-president at Ta Ching Hwa Enterprise Co .
-LRB- TCH -RRB- , as yet the only company in Taiwan to manufacture nylon 66 filament , recounts that ten years ago her husband and a group of friends who had worked many years at Formosa Chemicals and Fiber Corporation wanted to set up in business for themselves .
At that time , a huge amount of nylon 66 fiber - 600 tonnes per month - was used by the local textile industry in the manufacture of specialty apparel such as women 's tights , swimwear and underwear .
But Taiwan had no manufacturing capability in the fiber , and relied entirely on imports .
This aroused their interest in entering the field .
David and Goliath
Grace Kuo comments that nylon 66 was a new fiber with good elasticity , high strength and a soft , bulky feel , along with good resistance to ultraviolet light .
Adding just 15 to 20 % of nylon 66 to a fabric transforms it , making it thoroughly suited to modern - day demands for " healthy , comfortable " clothing .
The big international manufacturers had realized this and adopted an oligarchic strategy : as well as making it difficult for others to obtain the raw materials , they were very careful not to reveal any of their manufacturing know - how .
But thanks to the expertise the TCH team had built up over many years in the textile fibers field , within the first year after the company was set up they succeeded in drawing filaments from nylon 66 granules .
" As soon as we did that , Dupont cut their prices , hoping to squeeze us right out of the market , " says Grace Kuo with a smile .
But after going head - to - head with TCH for several years , Dupont realized how resilient the company was , and since then the two firms have begun to cooperate .
Currently , TCH is the world 's fifth - largest manufacturer of nylon 66 filament , supplying 8 % of the global market .
It stands as another example of a Taiwanese company successfully taking on the big boys in international markets .
The original use of nylon 66 was in tights and swimwear , but these are far from being the only applications for such a superior new fiber .
But because the filaments are so thin -LRB- only half the thickness of a human hair -RRB- , they can easily break at the yarn spinning stage , and at the dyeing stage the yarn absorbs only the smallest dye molecules .
Hence firms around the world are still feeling their way forward on how to use this fiber .
For this reason , TCH approached the CTI to conduct a series of cooperative development projects .
To date they have successfully developed various new yarns blended from nylon 66 and other fibers such as acrylic or polyester , and have staged numerous seminars and visited many firms to teach users how to weave and dye the new fabrics and how to design for them .
Why go to such lengths to popularize new fibers ?
Grace Kuo says the textile industry today needs to take a lead from the electronics industry , and constantly strive for innovation : " What consumer today does n't already have a wardrobe full of clothes ?
If you want to persuade her to spend , you have to keep putting out products which look novel at the first glance and feel great at the first touch .
Only then can you create demand and stimulate consumption , " she avers .
Behind the quest for innovation and change , there needs to be a great deal of R-AMP-D work , along with a keen nose for the market .
But 95 % of Taiwan 's textile firms are small or medium - sized enterprises .
They do not have the facilities or staff to carry on R-AMP-D , and they lack the perspective to take a broad view of worldwide trends .
Hence in the upgrading process , organizations like the CTI will play an increasingly important role .
Flexibility v. perfectionism
However , G - Fun Industrial Corporation general manager Tsai Chiu - hsiung , who worked at the CTI for many years before setting up in business for himself in late 1998 , has had a different experience .
While at the CTI , Tsai headed a project to develop the technology for making breathable waterproof fabrics .
At that time , he says , few manufacturers in Taiwan were both interested in the technology and competent to apply it .
Later , when his team had developed the process , many firms expressed an interest .
But once they had acquired the technology , many lost money or even went out of business - the results were far from ideal .
" At that time I felt very frustrated .
It was clearly a good process , but after buying the technology for a nominal sum , many companies did n't value it , " says Tsai Chiu - hsiung .
On the one hand , the market for breathable waterproof fabrics was not yet mature , and too many companies entering all at once knocked the bottom out of the market ; on the other , manufacturers in Taiwan still lack the concept of dedicating production equipment to one product .
For fear of putting all their eggs in one basket , many firms are in the habit of producing whatever they can get orders for : today it may be waterproof fabric , tomorrow cloth for tarpaulins , and next month purses .
Their product mix is very varied , with frequent switching .
This makes quality control difficult , so that when firms are faced with a technically demanding product , defects may easily arise .
Worse , they are often unable even to identify the cause .
" ' Flexibility ' helps SMEs survive in difficult times , but it is not conducive to the perfectionist attitudes needed when upgrading . "
Tsai Chiu - hsiung , who urges companies to " know when to give things up , " has now been in business for himself for a year , and his is the only firm in Taiwan which specializes in applying breathable waterproof coatings to fabrics .
With more orders than he can handle , he is now preparing to build a new factory at Touliu in Yunlin County .
G - Fun 's micropore breathable coating is a compound containing special water - soluble granules which create tiny pores in the fabric surface .
Sweat can evaporate through these pores without being absorbed by the fabric , improving comfort compared with traditional hydrophilic fabrics which when worn in the rain start sticking to the body after a time .
G - Fun is also co-operating with the CTI to develop waterproof fabrics with both micropore and hydrophilic characteristics .
At present , most of the company 's orders come from Europe and the USA , and are made into upmarket leisurewear such as climbing or golf apparel which sells for as much as NT$ 8,000 per garment .
Like TCH , G - Fun also hopes its products can help Taiwan 's textile industry upgrade .
" The 21st century will be an age of leisure , and Taiwanese sport and leisurewear fabrics have long held first place worldwide .
If they can all be given better breathability and water resistance , this will greatly increase their added value , " says Tsai Chiu - hsiung .
Fabrics treated by G - Fun are currently a third cheaper than the same grades of fabric from Japan , and Tsai hopes he can attract Taiwanese firms to make greater use of them .
A short - term view
Another type of new fabric which is in great demand is wicking fabric , based on fibers with a special cross-section .
The leading volume producer of wicking fibers in Taiwan is Chung Shing Textile Company .
Its president , William Shang , explains that conventional fibers have a round cross-section , but by changing the fibers ' physical properties it is possible to produce them with various cross-sectional profiles such as X or Y shapes , which create capillaries along the fibers .
These not only quickly wick sweat away from the skin , but also regulate body temperature and allow garments to dry quickly after washing .
However , the fibers ' special properties can easily be destroyed in the various processes they go through such as yarn spinning , weaving , dyeing and finishing , so that making finished garments requires a high degree of technical sophistication .
Chung Shing has launched a fabric named Coolplus to compete with Dupont 's equivalent product , Coolmax .
" Developing new fibers is the most important element in upgrading the textile industry , " says Shang .
However , he acknowledges that although many new products are being developed in Taiwan , on closer inspection they are all copies of products first developed elsewhere , and so fall some way short of real innovation .
But whereas it used to take Taiwanese companies several years of trial and error to figure out how to make such products , the gap between them and their European and American competitors is growing ever smaller .
When new products appear overseas it now only takes Taiwan two to three years to bring out an equivalent .
William Shang observes that when most Taiwanese firms see something new at an overseas exhibition they will bring back a sample , inspect it under a high - powered microscope to determine the weaving method and have it chemically analyzed to find out the composition of the fibers and finishing chemicals .
With Taiwan 's long years of manufacturing experience , it is then not difficult to reproduce the product with 70 - 80 % accuracy .
However , Shang does not see this as a viable long - term strategy .
" The best strategy for the long - term is still to put more effort into basic scientific research , " he says .
For example , he read in Time magazine that because spiders produce the best natural fibers in the world , being both lustrous and resilient , US scientists transferred spider genes into silkworms to produce " super silkworms . "
The technique succeeded , but because the Americans were not very interested in producing clothing textiles , they did not commercialize it .
When it comes to this kind of combination of lateral thinking and advanced technology , Taiwan still has some way to go .
Shang , currently chairman of the CTI 's technology committee , is well aware of where the obstacle to R-AMP-D lies : " Innovative ideas take time to mature , and you have to accept a high degree of uncertainty .
But our environment does not allow this . "
He notes that industries in Taiwan always pursue short - term profits , so there is never much interest in technologies which are too forward - looking and can not immediately produce saleable products .
As one of 18 industrial institutes under the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the CTI has some state funding .
But with ever greater budgetary constraints and pressure to cover its own costs , development projects mostly concentrate on firms ' current needs , and stress the sales and profit they generate .
Under such circumstances , epoch - making innovations are unlikely to emerge .
Standardizing colors
Because innovation is so hard to achieve , the highly innovative Sinocolor Book color reference system , which was launched at the CTI 's 40th anniversary celebration , has been greeted with great admiration by many .
The system 's inventor , Hsu Yun - peng , only had a junior high school education , but had researched color matching for 18 years in a dyeing factory .
Discovering that imported color matching software was of little practical use , Hsu , who did n't know a word of English , taught himself to program and wrote an improved version of the software .
Writing color matching software earned Hsu Yun - peng a lot of money , but this was not his main purpose .
His real aim was to produce a color reference system that was genuinely easy to use , to overcome the lack of color standardization which had long plagued the dyeing industry .
To pursue this goal he quit his job , moved to the suburbs of Kuishan in Taoyuan County , and began to spend 18 hours a day studying the problem .
Quite apart from the difficulties of keeping his family fed , he often was n't even sure how old his three children were and what year of school they were in .
Finally he used a three - dimensional model to create a regularly graded , finely differentiated color reference system covering 20,000 colors , each with clear " color coordinates . "
These features are unmatched by any of the systems currently in common use worldwide , which only define up to 3,000 colors .
The textile industry 's efforts to upgrade are gradually showing some results , but looking at the situation overall , CTI president Yao Hsing - chuan is still somewhat worried .
He comments that the majority of companies still have the traditional mindset of pursuing low - cost , high - volume production .
Taiwan is the world 's third biggest producer of man - made fibers , but it only produces a small range of mass - market fibers for apparel fabrics , to the almost total neglect of the hundred or so other high - added - value , special fibers on the market such as high - strength fibers for bullet - proof fabrics , elastic fibers or superalloy aerospace fibers .
Again , when it comes Taiwan 's biggest export item , finished fabrics , these too are largely limited to apparel fabrics , with few companies getting involved in other areas despite their potential .
For instance , Taiwan has been struck by many landslides in recent years , and requires large quantities of geotextiles - heavy - grade textiles laid under or around civil engineering structures to prevent erosion by groundwater movement .
The currently planned high - speed rail system alone is expected to require several million yards of geotextiles .
But Taiwanese companies are inexperienced in this area , and sending products overseas for quality certification tests is time consuming and complicated , so local companies can only stand and watch as the entire market goes to imported products .
Bullet - proof fabrics ?
Geotextiles ?
Are these part of the textile industry ?
Indeed they are .
Yao Hsing - chuan says that textile industry products have three main fields of application : apparel , furnishings and industrial .
At present , over 95 % by value of ROC textile industry output is accounted for by apparel products with low added value .
By contrast , in the USA textiles for clothing and industrial applications are produced in equal quantities , and industrial textiles include a wide variety of different products , many of which are technically demanding and command profit margins with which most apparel products can not compare .
Hence the CTI has already made it one of its major goals to encourage firms to shift their orientation towards industrial textiles .
The development of stainless - steel fibers is one success story in this area .
From false teeth to space suits
Dotted among the paddy fields of Taichung County 's Houli Rural Township are many metal - clad buildings which house a variety of factories producing such products as plastics , furniture and electronic components .
Among them is King 's Metal Fiber Technologies Company , the only firm in Taiwan which draws fibers from stainless steel .
King 's president Rocky Chang is known to all as Dr. Chang , and is indeed still a practicing dentist .
A decade or so ago , while he was studying in Australia , he developed an interest in metallurgy , and hoped to develop the use of metals in tooth implants .
Later he learned that stainless steels have an enormously wide range of applications in the textiles , industrial and military fields .
But he could not find a partner to work with in Australia , so he returned to Taiwan and began collaborating with the CTI .
Today , not only is King 's on a par with the large overseas manufacturers in terms of filament drawing technology , but to assist local downstream manufacturers in using its products , it has also set up metal fiber yarn spinning and fabric weaving plants , and is making efforts in the area of nonwoven fabrics .
Stroking the silver - gray ringlets which are twice as fine as human hair , Chang says that these soft , flexible fibers of high - grade steel can not only make fashion fabrics glisten with a mysterious modern sheen suitable for a millennium party , but - thanks to metals ' outstanding capacity to shield and conduct electromagnetic waves , and their ability to withstand high temperatures and acid or caustic environments - they also have a wide range of applications in many industries .
For instance , at a recent international furniture show in Taipei , King 's exhibited sound insulating panels containing metal fibers , which hi - fi buffs can install to produce an excellent sound studio effect .
Cellphone cases of metal fabric can shield users from the electromagnetic radiation the phones produce ; and in the clean rooms of silicon wafer fabs , where dust particles attracted by static electricity on clothing are the biggest bugbear , there is a host of applications for anti-static fabrics , from workers ' clothing and footwear to trolleys , conveyor belts and wall coverings .
Rocky Chang says that before King 's started producing metal fibers , the market was divided up between a few foreign companies which charged high prices and produced only small quantities of products .
Furthermore , when Taiwanese users had difficulties with production they did not know who to turn to for help .
Looking into the future , Chang hopes that as a key material , stainless steel fiber can have a " locomotive " effect , encouraging various industries in Taiwan to develop a range of different products .
Time to get weaving
Developing industrial textiles requires an understanding of different industries ' needs , and also requires new channels of distribution .
For instance , cellphone cases have to be sold through electronic goods shops , while car airbags have to be sold into automotive distribution channels .
For entrepreneurs who have previously only sold into the clothing trade , this is a challenge .
How to promote " cross-industry cooperation , " and get people in the textile industry to look beyond their own industry 's boundaries and become effective partners for the electronics , construction , medical supplies and other industries is the next task for the CTI to tackle .
As CTI president Yao Hsing - chuan observes , what has enabled Taiwan 's textile industry to survive through the ups and downs of its history is the highly motivated attitude of its entrepreneurs .
It is this ambition which is the best guarantee of the industry creating a second spring .

An unusual fashion show at the China Textile Institute 's 40th anniversary celebration : the focus is not on showing fashionable new styles , but on introducing the latest fruits of textile product development in the ROC .
The stainless steel fibers in the fabrics worn by these models have potential applications not only in avant - garde fashions , but also in industrial conveyor belts and even space suits .

Eight years ago , this was just a textile testing center with a handful of single - storey buildings and a staff of less than 20 .
But president Yao Hsing - chuan -LRB- left -RRB- , has single - handedly transformed it into today 's China Textiles Institute , with a staff of nearly 300 .
With him is Ho Yu - lan , formerly director of the Taiwan Textile Federation and now consultant to the CTI .
