I 'm getting older , and my mom is worried about me getting married ; I 've seen a few to ogle at , but I 've cut them off , and also some have cut me off .
No success so far .
Finally somebody introduced me to one ; we made a schedule for the weekend to go to a classmate 's house for dinner , and also meet the new date .
She looked not bad ; she was a former co-worker of our classmate 's wife ; her appearance was proper , and eating and all was no problem ; I 'm just an ordinary older WSN .
mm chatted and chatted , and discovered that she and my female cousin were classmates , that was really exciting .
Then ... nothing more until after March , when I came back from a business trip ...
My schoolmate 's wife is not too bright , and she was unable to help me ask mm out about her opinion , and I was also embarrassed to ask , and all my schoolmate could do was invite us to dinner again .
mm was very happy to come to dinner , but I am rather shy -LRB- so my cousin says -RRB- .
So I did n't talk to her , and after dinner we all sang K , then my classmate 's wife suggested I see mm home .
She refused , and after that I never got together with mm again ...
That was my first time ... for a blind date ...
