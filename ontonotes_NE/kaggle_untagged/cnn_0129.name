Armed conflict in the Balkans puts an international spotlight on a Serb leader .
Bob Glascoff looks at Slobodan Milosevic 's rise to power , and his recent political setback , in today 's edition of `` Headliners . ''
In December of 1990 , Slobodan Milosevic is elected President in Serbia 's first free elections in 50 years .
Milosevic headed Yugoslavia 's state - run gas company and was President of a major Belgrade bank climbing the political ladder as a Communist technocrat .
He used his rising popularity amongst the Serb people to oust former mentor Ivan Stambolic and take over as President of the Serbian republic .
His brutal efforts to create a Serb - dominated Yugoslavia earned him the nickname `` Butcher of the Balkans . ''
Many speculated that Milosevic , whose parents and uncle committed suicide , might be mentally unbalanced himself .
Constitutionally barred from serving a third term as Serbian President , he clung to power by having the federal parliament elect him President of Yugoslavia .
Milosevic was defeated by opposition leader Vojislave Kostunica in presidential elections this year , but refused to accept the results .
Faced with massive demonstrations and Russia 's backing of Kostunica , he agreed to step down in October .
With `` Headliners , '' I 'm Bob Glascoff .
