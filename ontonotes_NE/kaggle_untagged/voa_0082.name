United Nations has restored full membership to Yugoslavia , eight years after it lost its voting rights .
VOA 's Breck Ardery reports from the UN .
The General Assembly enthusiastically approved Yugoslavia 's membership by acclamation after receiving a positive recommendation Tuesday , from the UN Security Council .
Assembly President Harry Holkerry made the official announcement .
I therefore declare the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia admitted to membership in the United Nation .
The action ends eight years of isolation of Yugoslavia at the United Nations .
When Yugoslavia began breaking up in 1992 , the General Assembly stripped the nation of its voting rights and ruled Yugoslavia must reapply for UN membership , but it never did until a few days ago when the new democratically elected President of Yugoslavia , Vojislav Kostunica sent a formal request to the United Nations .
US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said , President Kostunica is to be congratulated .
We congratulate President Kostunica on his leadership in bringing peaceful and democratic change to Yugoslavia .
We congratulate his colleagues in the brave democracy movement that brought the will of the people to power in Belgrade .
President Kostunica has sent a special envoy to the United Nations , Goran Slevonovich , who told the General Assembly the new government in Yugoslavia will work with its neighbors to overcome problems .
To that end , Yugoslavia will be a trustful neighbor and a conscientious member of the international community and will invest its best efforts to promote peace and stability in the region , as well as worldwide .
Mr. Slevonovich also thanked those nations that supported the democratic movement in Yugoslavia in what he called a hard and often uphill battle .
