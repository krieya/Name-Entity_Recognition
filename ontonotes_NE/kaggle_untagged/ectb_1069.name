Middle age and the changes it brings are like a revolving door .
Many people peacefully go through it , growing wiser and losing their rough edges .
A minority do n't know whether to advance or retreat and get caught in it like a trap .
Middle age is a time where one wears more hats than at any other time in one 's life , when one 's responsibilities are heaviest .
As a result , the crises experienced by a minority of middle - aged people can involve a lot of other people , so their impact can not be overlooked .
Middle age , those years between 40 and 60 , is both the time of life of greatest glory and the time of life that 's easiest to overlook .
In comparison to youth or old age , the middle years are often thought of as the time when power , ability , wealth , and physical strength are all at or near their peak , so that one has no excuse for feeling melancholy .
Even if there are problems , it is commonly thought that one should be able to resolve them by oneself , notes Chiu Chia - li , director of the Hwo Chyuan Pastoral Counseling Center , who has worked on many middle - aged cases .
Social bias makes many of the middle aged afraid to discuss their problems .
This is particularly the case for men , who generally find it difficult to talk about their feelings .
But by keeping everything inside , they may cause irreparable harm to their health .
In recent years cancer , sudden death and suicide have become all too common during middle age , which shows that the psychological problems of the middle - aged should not be overlooked .
How do you safely pass through the changes of the middle years ?
Here are a few suggestions :
1. Live well at every stage of life
Li Liang - che , a professor of psychology at National Chengchi University , looks at the question from the angle of developmental psychology .
He points out that the path of life is continuous : everyone moves from infancy and childhood , to youth and middle age .
Smoothly passing through any period of life helps make getting through the next period easier .
In other words , the people most at risk during middle age are those who have had difficulties earlier in life .
Foreign research shows that those with high social and economic status and with ample financial resources bear up better during crisis and have more ways to get out of trouble .
Is it too late to start talking about these problems when you are already middle - aged ?
Chang Der - chung , an associate professor in the Department of Living Science at National Open University who worked at a counseling hotline for over a decade , argues that any step in the right direction is worthwhile , no matter when you start .
Middle - aged problems are rather predictable , and they 're not hard to avoid .
Are you worried that your marriage is growing stale ?
Then no matter how busy you are , you 've got to set aside some time to be with your spouse .
Are you worried about losing your job ?
Then start developing a second skill and get into the habit of saving and managing your money .
Are you worried about how to care for your parents when they get old and sick ?
Then spend more time with them , and encourage them to get more exercise and take care of themselves .
There are so many things to be concerned about during middle age that you had better get an early start .
Otherwise , you 'll end up being overwhelmed .
2. Start over
In China it used to be said that middle age was the period when one was " heir to the ancient sages and the teacher of posterity . "
But now times are changing so fast that perhaps the lessons of past experience are no longer suitable for solving today 's problems .
To assume a posture of superiority based on one 's seniority will make one despised .
Hence , it is necessary to cast aside one 's old self and start over .
Chiu notes that many middle - aged who have worked diligently for years to attain management positions look down on the younger generation for being reckless and disorganized , but they do n't realize that creativity and energy may be ready to explode from underneath these flaws .
Stuck in the past and full of bitterness , they may end up getting discarded onto the scrap heap of history .
With each new era , role models change .
Until the new role models have been established , it is important to maintain flexibility .
For instance , today 's middle - aged Chinese women are the first to have obtained advanced degrees and to have come in contact with the women 's liberation movement .
They set high expectations for themselves , but their disappointments are likewise large .
Many women are torn between conflicting desires : to be good homemakers like their mothers and to have successful careers like their fathers .
Their candles are burning at both ends , because they are trying to live up to two old role models rather than establishing a new one for themselves .
Then there are men who insist upon being strict fathers and disciplinarians or staying at the same company until they retire .
And there are women who are determined to play the role of the traditional Chinese wife and mother .
Ignoring the changing times , they place tremendous pressure on themselves .
3. Turn the focus from outside to inside
Life is a process that moves from the " outward " to the " inward , " says Alice Lu , director of the International Family Life Education Center , getting to the heart of the matter .
Lu explains that as children people yearn for the affection of their parents ; as adolescents they want the affirmation of their peers ; and as adults , they set their sights on educational qualifications , finding a good job , making money , marrying a good spouse and so forth .
Everyone puts the emphasis on outward manifestations of success , and this emphasis on the glitter of outward achievement continues up to middle age .
" By middle age , people have gotten from the outside world just about all they can , " says Lu .
" What they have n't attained yet they probably wo n't attain ever , so it 's not worth getting all worked up about it .
This is the time of life when the doubts set in . "
Many middle - aged people begin to ask themselves , " Is this really what I want ?
What has been the point of all my hard striving ? "
When the doubts come , some people continue trying to find answers from outside , thinking that everything would be fine if they could just change jobs or wives !
But then they rashly switch jobs or foolishly get involved in an affair only to find that they 've just made things worse .
" In middle age you start to listen to what 's going on inside , " says Lu .
" It 's the time of life when you start to hone your skills at conversing with your soul . "
People ask themselves : Am I truly happy ?
Do I like the person I see in the mirror ?
Why ?
What dreams can I pursue ?
At this point , there is no longer any need to try to measure oneself against outside standards .
Instead it 's more important to accept oneself and attempt to find an inner balance .
" One need not compare one 's inner achievements with those of other people , " notes Chiu .
Everyone 's circumstances and personalities are different , and they place different expectations on themselves .
It 's not a matter of being better or worse than anyone else , and there 's no need to follow the currents of fashion .
Everyone is unique .
Morris Chang was in his fifties when he became an entrepreneur and founded Taiwan Semiconductor .
Many others at the same time in life have opted to take early retirement and find a guru in India , work as a volunteer , or do whatever else they want to do .
In the modern age when people value different things , you can find a purely personal kind of happiness and success .
4. Realistically strive for one 's dreams
When focusing inward , many dreams that have long been discarded will end up floating to the surface .
At such times , one should remember to ask oneself three questions :
" What do I want ? " " What can I do ? " And " What must I do and have ? "
Chang Der - chung reminds people to think clearly about their needs , and then think about the costs .
Will meeting these personal needs necessarily come into conflict with meeting one 's responsibilities ?
Is there some way that the two can be accomplished simultaneously ?
When facing problems at work in Taiwan , many people decide to change careers or even to pursue their fortunes in mainland China or Southeast Asia .
Pursuing some dream of really making it big , many men use up their savings , leaving their wives as the sole source of family support and suffering loneliness in a foreign land .
There 's no right or wrong here , and there 's no way to guarantee a venture will be successful , but beforehand one must at least be realistic and prepare oneself psychologically for all possible outcomes , so that one wo n't suffer losses larger than one can bear .
" It is indeed the case that when one is young , one 's quiver is full of arrows and opportunities abound , so that one can shoot at will , " says Chang by way of analogy .
" Once you get into middle age , you 've got to make every arrow count . "
Chang explains that everyone has dreams , and that continually working toward those dreams is an excellent method of relieving stress at any age .
Middle - aged people have heavy burdens , and sometimes they may feel as if they are suffocating under them .
" But accomplishing a lot of little changes can bring about a big change . "
If you make an effort to do what you can , you will immediately find that your burdens have been lightened .
Chang cites this example : Say you hate being tied up by your work , and would like to go back to school .
Why do n't you try a weekend class ?
Maybe that would help to alleviate your anxiety .
Or if you are a housewife , taking care of three generations and resentful that you ca n't go out and get the sense of accomplishment that comes with a full - time job , then maybe you could work as a volunteer in a community organization .
This would both put you into contact with other people and help you gain a sense of accomplishment .
And you can help to sweat off your middle - aged anxieties by making a habit of regularly exercising .
What 's more , do n't worry too much about time being short .
Remember that most modern people live long lives that can be divided up into many stages .
In middle age , when you discover that your personal desires are coming into conflict with the demands of your family or society , decide which of your problems are the most urgent .
Do n't try to accomplish all of your dreams at once .
Maintain an unhurried frame of mind and peacefully wait for opportunities to present themselves .
5. Change your perspective
In middle age , one 's life is already half over , and one has already amply tasted of life 's fruits , both the bitter and the sweet .
" I am thankful for the bad times , for they have given me more insight into life and a better opportunity to understand myself , " says Lin Hung - kuei , an I - kuan Tao devotee , who has studied the Book of Changes and fengshui .
Taking care of your parents , losing your job , illness and even being cheated out of money can be embraced as opportunities to experience life .
They are lessons that the middle - aged learn from to become more proficient at the art of living .
" By changing perspective , you can understand the insignificance of your problems , " points out Chiu Chia - li .
It is very important to adjust your frame of mind .
You should n't think that there is only one way that you can be .
As long as you can accept yourself , then everything is all right .
As for losing your job in middle age , some people make NT$ 100,000 and it 's not enough .
Other's find that NT$ 20,000 is more than enough to support the family .
The problem is that by insisting on making NT$ 100,000 a month , you may pass by a suitable job that pays NT$ 20,000 .
Chang also notes that when people come to forks in the road when they reach middle age , they may look around in all directions and feel at a loss , but they 've got to encourage themselves to keep pressing ahead .
" Even if you feel uncertain , it should be a positive feeling of uncertainty . "
At the very least , you 've got to work hard at establishing a sense of direction .
When Li Liang - che starts feeling sorry for himself , he uses the age - old method of considering those who are even worse off .
Those people who are always complaining about their lot in life should take a walk around a cancer ward , " Li says .
Then they 'll realize how lucky they are . "
Chiu Chia - li , on the other hand , encourages the middle - aged not to close themselves off .
They must get out and make friends , so as to get things off their chests and find support from each other .
This makes it easier to get through the bad times .
Finally , there is something that may seem a little cliched but is often very useful - namely the realization that things will get better , that tomorrow is another day .
" Whether you are depressed or going berserk , it 's important to remember that hormones are raging inside the bodies of the middle - aged , " says Chang .
Much like rebellious adolescents , they may merely need to pass through into another stage for the sky to become blue again .
Do n't give up hope too early , and do n't be afraid of asking for assistance .
When you feel at a loss emotionally , the experts will be able to help .
