On August 25 President Chen Shui - bian wrapped up his first overseas trip since taking office , swinging through three countries in Latin America and another three in Africa .
While in the Dominican Republic to attend the inauguration of President Hipolito Mejia , Chen had a chance to meet with the leaders of many different nations .
The president signed joint communiques with Nicaragua , Gambia , and Chad , and agreed to provide US$ 4.6 million worth of loans to the Dominican Republic to serve as a guarantee to help the latter secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund .
" We can not use pressure from Beijing as an excuse for our diplomatic setbacks , " said Chen , who used concrete actions to demonstrate to ROC 's allies that our country has no intention of pulling back from its diplomatic partnerships ; on the contrary , the ROC will be working even harder than before .
Chen Shui - bian left on August 13 for a 13 - day trip that included state visits to the Latin American nations of the Dominican Republic , Nicaragua , Costa Rica , as well as the west African nations of Gambia , Burkina Faso , and Chad .
Before boarding the plane on the 13th , Chen Shui - bian delivered a short speech in which he stated , " Taiwan must stand up and be counted . "
The purpose of this trip , said Chen , is to share Taiwan 's experiences with other countries , and he also indicated the hope that this trip would help to solidify Taiwan 's diplomatic relations .
The entourage was the largest ever to accompany an ROC president abroad , and included : Chuang Ming - yao -LRB- secretary - general , National Security Council -RRB- , Tien Hung - mao -LRB- minister of foreign affairs -RRB- , Lin Hsin - yi -LRB- minister of economic affairs -RRB- , Chen Po - chih -LRB- chairman , Council of Economic Planning and Development -RRB- , Chen Hsi - huang -LRB- chairman , Council of Agriculture -RRB- , Chung Chin -LRB- head of the Government Information Office -RRB- , Jeffrey Koo -LRB- chairman of the National Association of Industry and Commerce -RRB- , Wang Yu - tseng -LRB- chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce of the ROC -RRB- , and Lin Kun - chung -LRB- chairman of the Chinese National Federation of Industries -RRB- .
There were also many legislators in the delegation , including Hung Chi - chang , Helen Chu , Feng Ting - kuo , and Li Yin - yun .

The total size of the delegation came to nearly 200 people , including more than 50 journalists .
The president kept to a very tight schedule during the trip .
After a brief stopover in Los Angeles on the 13th , Chen continued on and reached the Dominican Republic on the 14th .
He attended the presidential inauguration there on the 16th , and was able to meet with the leaders and representatives of friendly nations from around the world .
On the 17th he continued on to Nicaragua , where he met with President Arnoldo Aleman and delivered a speech to the Nicaraguan National Assembly .
On the 18th , presidents Chen and Aleman signed a joint communique before Chen Shui - bian departed for Costa Rica , where he received the Great Cross of Juan Mora Fernandez , a gold medal which is the nation 's highest award .
On the 20th he flew across the Atlantic Ocean to Gambia to meet with Gambian President Yahya Jameh before heading on to Burkina Faso and a dinner with President Blaise Compaore .
On the 23rd Chen delivered a speech to the Gambian parliament .
The next stop on the itinerary was Chad , where Chen dined with Chad 's President Idris Debi .
On the 25th Chen and Debi signed a joint communique and held a press conference before heading back to Taiwan slightly ahead of schedule to oversee efforts to deal with the powerful Typhoon Bilis .
Chen 's stopover in Los Angeles was a sensitive subject , for Chen had originally planned an informal meeting with several members of the US Congress .
After furious protests from Beijing and discouragement from the US State Department , however , Chen canceled the plan just the day before arriving in Los Angeles .
A crowd of 500 to 600 Taiwanese living in the United States showed up to greet the president at his hotel and protest against the US government 's " caving in to Beijing at the expense of Taiwan . "
When Chen arrived on the 14th in the Dominican Republic , he was greeted at the airport by over 100 representatives of the Taiwanese business community there , and more than 700 Taiwanese residents threw a party for the president that night at his hotel .
The next day , Chen took advantage of the upcoming presidential inauguration to meet with leaders from a number of countries with which the ROC has diplomatic relations , including the vice-president of El Salvador and the second vice president of Panama .
On the 16th Chen attended the inauguration of President Hipolito Mejia .
The ROC contingent was larger than any other at the ceremony .
The ROC currently has diplomatic relations with 29 countries , half of which are located in Latin America and the Caribbean .
In recent years , however , mainland China has continually upgraded its trade links with the ROC 's diplomatic partners .
The allegiance of a number of these countries may be put to the test in the coming years by various political and economic considerations .
In the case of the Dominican Republic , for example , supporters of President Mejia announced to the media on the eve of President Chen 's arrival that mainland China was planning to build a large thermal power plant in their country .
In addition , the Dominican Republic is seeking a seat on the UN Security Council in 2002 , and will certainly be lobbying for Beijing 's support .
This situation could affect relations with Taiwan .
On the bright side , Taiwan has scored a few points of its own in this diplomatic tug of war .
When Chen arrived in Costa Rica on the 18th , his hosts departed from the pattern of the past few years by promising to support the ROC s bid for membership in the United Nations .
Costa Rica 's President Miguel Rodriguez also accompanied President Chen on a tour of a Taiwanese export processing zone , an orchid farm run by Taiwan Sugar Corporation , and a vocational training school .
President Chen departed on the 20th for Africa , where the ROC has eight diplomatic partners .
Chen Shui - bian is the first ROC president ever to travel to western Africa .
There is little two - way trade between Taiwan and any of the three countries on Chen 's African itinerary .
Instead , agricultural and economic assistance constitute the mainstays of our diplomatic ties with these countries .
Taiwanese agricultural specialists stationed in Burkina Faso have converted 1,000 hectares of desert to arable land , while Taiwanese specialists sent to Gambia have successfully transplanted tomatoes , green beans , okra , and various leafy vegetables from Taiwan and raised them on Gambian soil .
In addition to this type of technical assistance , Taiwan has also assisted with various infrastructure projects .
Taiwan 's most notable contribution to Gambia 's infrastructure is the main terminal at the airport .
Gambian President Yahya Jameh declared his support for admission of the ROC to the United Nations , and as a gesture of goodwill declared that all holders of ROC passports would henceforth automatically be granted 90 - day landing visas upon arrival in Gambia .
President Chen 's trip yielded many positive results and generated a lot of very favorable media coverage , but it was not problem - free .
First , as the president was preparing to depart Taiwan , the Nicaraguan foreign minister publicly called upon the ROC to make good on the previous administration 's promise of US$ 100 million in assistance .
This remark sparked controversy in Taiwan , where some accused the new government of pursuing the same " checkbook diplomacy " practiced by its predecessor .
Chen Shui - bian responded that while the new administration has not made plans for any new promises of foreign aid , neither will it fail to honor the promises made by its predecessor .
Foreign Minister Tien Hung - mao stated that the purpose of Chen 's trip was to consolidate Taiwan 's diplomatic ties , and to strengthen friendships by building upon the existing foundation .
Tien stressed that the president would not sign any new foreign aid agreements .
President Chen received a very warm welcome in Nicaragua , but the local press still mentioned " checkbook diplomacy " in reporting on the visit .
The ROC 's ambassador to Nicaragua , Antonio Tsai , bluntly argued in a briefing with Chen that Taiwan 's foreign assistance to Nicaragua was being misused .
According to Tsai , the assistance has been used to build a presidential palace and a new headquarters for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Opposition politicians charge that the aid has done nothing for everyday people , and Western nations have also been critical .
A second problem connected with the trip was the question of who would act in the president 's stead while he was out of the country .
Concern over this issue prompted President Chen to state before his departure that he would remain commander - in - chief of the military forces , and that he would maintain hot lines to every cabinet - level agency .
The president said that there was no need for an acting president because he had taken painstaking precautions to ensure domestic political stability during his absence .
So is Taiwan 's diplomacy a way of giving back to the international community ?
Or is it checkbook diplomacy ?
Ambassador - without - portfolio Lu Yi - cheng wrote an article in which he argued that foreign aid has always been universally recognized as a regular tool of diplomacy as well as a humanitarian necessity , and there is no reason why Taiwan should have to steer clear of it .
He pointed out that the world 's developed nations spend an average of 0.24 % of GNP on foreign aid , as opposed to 0.17 % in Taiwan 's case .
In view of Taiwan 's economic strength , argued Lu , our foreign aid expenditures need not be reduced ; in fact , they should even be raised somewhat .
The ROC has been criticized a lot in recent years for pursuing checkbook diplomacy , so there was no surprise when this issue cropped up in connection with the president 's trip .
The question of an acting president , however , has never before been a matter of concern .
This situation is to some degree a reflection of the fact that the public still has doubts about the new administration 's ability to govern .
This is an important point that is worth keeping in mind .
