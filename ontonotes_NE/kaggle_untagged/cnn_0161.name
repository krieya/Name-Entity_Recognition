The first official parliamentary vote results in the Yugoslav republic of Serbia show President Vojislav Kostunica 's reform government winning in a landslide victory .
The official electoral commission says the Democratic Opposition of Serbia won about 65 % of the vote , compared to 13 % for Slobodan Milosevic 's Socialist Party .
That 's based on returns from just under a third of polling stations .
Kostunica defeated Milosevic in September 's presidential elections .
Milosevic will be swept out of the powerful Serbian government , leaving him vulnerable to U.N. war crimes prosecution .
Final official voting results could take until Wednesday .
