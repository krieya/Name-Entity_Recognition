Paralympics Offer Stage for Taiwan Performers
Closing ceremonies for the 2000 Sydney Paralympics were held on October 29 .
Nearly 4000 athletes from more than one hundred and twenty countries participated .
This event , a manifestation of the ideal that " the flame burns in the body , mind , and spirit of every individual , " broke down international barriers and was an admirable example of the global village in operation .
The ROC team took one gold , two silvers , and four bronzes , marking the first time any Taiwan athlete has returned from an Olympic games with a gold .
Also , as part of the events , Taiwan 's Crescent Moon Dance Troupe , made up of handicapped persons , was the only foreign troupe invited by the Australian government to participate in the Paralympic Arts Festival .
But even more important than these honors was the spirit of overcoming all obstacles and facing life with courage that shone through during the Paralympics .
The just - completed Paralympics were enriched by ethnic flavorings .
The opening ceremony on October 18 was in the form of a welcoming for aboriginal elders .
Amidst a festive atmosphere , the athletes entered the stadium by categories - one group in wheelchairs , another on crutches , another led by guide dogs .
The events at the 12 - day Paralympics were packed with spectators .
The 1.1 million tickets sold show the extent to which everyone took the games seriously .
The host government even set up a huge TV screen in Darwin , which is the port of entry for the most visitors to Australia , to broadcast the games live .
The games were also a platform for the idea of the welfare state caring for disadvantaged groups , and for emphasizing how handicapped persons can break through barriers and limitations .
On October 14 , Taiwan 's Crescent Moon Dance Company created a sensation with their performance " Standing on the Highest Peak , " performed in traditional vests and short skirts as worn by indigenous people in Taiwan .
After the 10 - minute performance ended , the hall was rocked by thunderous applause .
The standing ovation lasted three minutes , and some people were even moved to tears .
The Crescent Moon Dance Company has only been in operation for four years .
Organized by a group of amputee women on a nonprofessional basis , it is the world 's first dance troupe of its kind .
As its manifesto reads : " One with no voice may nonetheless sing .
One with no wings may nonetheless soar .
One with no limbs may nonetheless dance .
The crescent moon and the full moon are the moon just the same , and equally beautiful . "
The troupe also delighted Sydney citizens with a performance at the Sydney City Hall on October 19 .
In the competition , host country Australia took the most medals , including 64 golds
.
Among the ROC 's medals , the gold - the first ever for Taiwan - was won by Chiang Chih - chung .
With a throw of 57.28 meters , Chiang shattered the world record for the javelin in the F12 visually - impaired class .
Chiang , a member of the Bunun indigenous people , received a traditional hero 's welcome home from the Bunun of Sanmin Rural Township in Kaohsiung County .
During the festivities , which were both moving and fun , tribal elders sang warrior songs and praised Chiang for his glorious deeds .
Meanwhile , the ROC table tennis team twice made it to the finals , but fell just short of the gold each time .
In the wheelchair men 's doubles class 5 event , Chou Chang - sheng and Lin Yen - hung took the silver , while Chou won another silver in the men 's singles .
The men 's class 9 team for persons with non-leg - related disabilities and the women 's wheelchair team of combined classes 4 and 5 took bronzes in team events , while Li Ching - chung -LRB- men 's judo class 1 -RRB- and Lu Li - hua -LRB- women 's powerlifting class 1 -RRB- garnered individual bronzes .
Among Asian countries , South Korea turned in the best performance , taking five gold medals .
This was due in part to the fact that the ROK government has provided special coaching in wheelchair table tennis to soldiers injured in service .
Indeed , many handicapped competitors from other nations besides the ROK were retired veterans .
Their pensions allow them free time to train , and through athletics they bring meaning to their lives and glory to their countries .
Taiwan team members , on the other hand , come from a variety of backgrounds , and train out of personal interest .
They must give up working if they wish to train full - time .
The South Korean team of veterans , by overcoming their injuries to give a display of athleticism at the international level , have emerged from the shadow of war and transformed their handicaps into glorious results .
This example should provide food for thought to the disabled and sports communities in the future .
