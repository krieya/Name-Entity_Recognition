Cracking Down on Black Gold
-LRB- Teng Sue - fen / tr. by Christopher MacDonald -RRB-
At the end of December there was an - other piece of good news concerning the new government 's crackdown on crime .
Fugitive Huang Wen - chung , wanted for complicity in the slaying of former Kaohsiung County Council speaker Wu Ho - sung , was arrested in Phuket after a two - year investigation and with the cooperation of the Thai police authorities .
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob - affiliated individuals from running for public office .
It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics .
Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .
On December 15 the Ministry of Justice released the results of the first six months of its campaign against black gold -LRB- i.e. collusion among politicians , crime syndicates and big business -RRB- .
In the period up to December 10 , prosecutors around Taiwan dealt with more than 2,000 cases concerning black - gold offenses , brought charges against 30 elected officials and representatives , and found over NT$ 2.59 billion in misappropriated public funds .
The following cases , currently under investigation , have attracted particular attention : the alleged involvement of Linkou mayor Tsai Tzung - yi , Yingko Township chief Hsu Yuan - ho and Linkou council deputy chairman Chou Yeh - feng in the operation of an illegal waste dump at a disused brickyard ; alleged fraud by Nantou County commissioner Peng Pai - hsien in connection with construction projects ; allegations of corruption against Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen - chien ; and the suspected embezzlement of post-921 earthquake relief funds by Hsinchu municipal council speaker Cheng Cheng - kuang .
Cases in which charges have already been brought include : the alleged misuse of public funds for overseas trips by Miaoli County commissioner Fu Hsueh - peng , along with county councilors Lo Hsing - chun and Hsieh Ching - chuan ; alleged breaches of the Securities Transaction Law by leading brokerage owner You Hwai - yin ; alleged financial fraud by national legislator Lin Jui - tu ; and alleged corruption by Tainan mayor George Chang in connection with a canal dredging project .
On December 6 the Executive Yuan passed a draft amendment to the Public Officials Election and Recall Law , tightening the criteria for those seeking public office so as to prevent mob affiliates from securing legal immunity as elected representatives .
Under the new provisions , anyone convicted and sentenced to jail under the Organized Crime Statute is barred for life from seeking election to an official post , while those indicted for a capital offence or for crimes carrying sentences of ten years or more are barred pending the verdict of the court .
Political parties become liable for the records of their candidates and face fines of NT$ 500,000 to NT$ 5 million if they nominate candidates who have prior convictions for electoral fraud or election violence .
These revisions to the law will immediately affect a number of parliamentary incumbents , including legislators Kuo Ting - tsai and Wu Tze - yuan , both of whom face disqualification from re-election .
The new provisions have received cross-party support in the legislature , though some deputies want further consultation concerning the exclusion from elections of those charged with but not yet convicted of the relevant offences , as this may deprive them unfairly of their rights .
Ho Chih - hui , secretary - general of the KMT caucus in the legislature , says that the party supports barring those convicted of involvement in organized crime from public office , but feels that the Executive Yuan needs to clarify just what " involvement " constitutes in this context .
Also , at the end of December and after much consultation within the opposition alliance , a preliminary agreement was reached on the draft amendment to the Farmers ' and Fishermen 's Associations Law , which has been under lengthy review in the legislature .
According to the agreement , restrictions on those seeking association membership and sub-committee posts will be relaxed , but the rules will be tightened for those running for the posts of director or general secretary , excluding or removing from office anyone who is in default for more than a year on loans from these and other such financial organizations .
However , the amendment remains stuck in the legislative queue for the time being .
In addition to the Ministry of Justice , the Criminal Investigation Bureau has also scored some successes in the past few months in its campaign against crime syndicates .
In early November the leader of the Four Seas Gang , Yang Kuang - nan , who had been arrested in Shanghai by mainland authorities , was transferred to Taiwanese custody in the transit lounge at Macau Airport and brought back to Taiwan for questioning .
Yang had fled to the mainland in November 1997 , after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with a loan - shark operation , and has been a key target for the police ever since .
Good news has also been coming in from local prosecutors ' offices around Taiwan .
Prosecutors in Taitung have been investigating county councilors for alleged corruption involving public grants and construction projects , and after half a year of the investigation 19 representatives have been indicted , including the current speaker and deputy speaker of the county council , along with 41 members of the previous two sessions of the council .
This sets a judicial record for the number of elected representatives facing charges in a single case .
Meanwhile , prosecutors in Changhua have been investigating electoral fraud from the time of the presidential election , and are seeking sentences of two months to three years for over 200 people , including the head of Yuanlin Township , for breaking the Election and Recall Law .
The Ministry of Justice has achieved a measure of success so far in its crackdown on black gold , but in order to win public support it has had to stress to investigators the need to observe due process and respect suspects ' rights .
The ministry has also required prosecutors to use discretion when collecting evidence about suspected financial impropriety by officials - for which there is a low rate of conviction - so as not to obstruct the work of civil servants or damage their morale .
