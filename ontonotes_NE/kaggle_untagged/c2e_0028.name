Ding Yunhong , who came from mainland China and then immigrated to Windsor , Ontario , by way of the US , will attend the public hearing for judgment on his accusation of the federal government at 10:00 a.m. next Monday -LRB- January 8 -RRB- at the federal appeal court in Toronto .
During Ding Yunhong 's application for citizenship , a CIC official accused him of violating the law such as going to the US without notification , failing to report children upon landing , and attending school while collecting unemployment benefits .
Ding Yunhong gave explanations and responses to these accusations one by one , believing that this government official 's abuse of power had constituted infringement of his rights protected by the Canadian constitution and laws .
After filing complaints with CIC several times with no results , Ding Yunhong filed a complaint against the Canadian government with the federal court in Toronto on July 22 , 2004 .
After receiving the complaint , the civil court prosecuted the case on October 1 , 2004 .
On December 3 of the same year , Ding Yunhong became a Canadian citizen .
However , he believed he had suffered enough humiliation and damage during the application process and therefore further filed his complaint with the federal appeal court to demand justice .
He said that getting involved in the lawsuit with the government and court had subjected him and his family to tremendous pains and that he had suffered long - term depression because of that , but he could not do nothing for any injustice and discrimination imposed on him and will continue to fight .
