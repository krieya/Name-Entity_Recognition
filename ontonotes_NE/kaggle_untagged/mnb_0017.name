Finally tonight , humor as perspective , and for that , we depend on the staff and crew of `` Saturday Night Live '' who this weekend took on the deadlocked election .
Here now a sampling .
Good evening , America .
I 'm Vice President Al Gore .
And I 'm the Governor of Texas , George W. Bush .
As you know , this election has been the closest in history , and the results is still in dispute .
That 's right .
It 's in dispute because some people do n't know when they got beat .
Like in Florida , I got 2,910,198 votes , and he got a measley 2,909,827 .
Eat it , Gore .
It 's also in dispute because some people in this race can not accept losing a popularity contest .
Ay if you 'll check the national popular vote , you 'll see that I Al Gore have been proven to be ipso facto , the most popular man in America .
Heck , I 'm this close to having teenage girls throw their panties at me .
But listen .
We may have our differences , but I do n't want to be dividers .
We want to be unificators .
Unificators .
So a solution has been found that 's both fair and consistent with the will of the American people .
We 're both going to be President .
Heck , you all did n't know who you wanted anyway .
It 's true .
It 's going to be great .
Hey , C.J. , roll that tape .
On November 7 , George W. Bush and Al Gore ran for President , but there was no clear winner , so they decided to govern together .
Could they share the White House without driving each other crazy ?
Man , that was cool .
