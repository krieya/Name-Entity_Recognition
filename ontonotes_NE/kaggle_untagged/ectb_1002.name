My Heart is in Macau :
" Local Portuguese " Carlos Marreiros
-LRB- Jackie Chen / tr. by Brent Heinrich -RRB-
Around the time of the Macau handover , questions that were hot in the Western media were , What is " Macaense " ?
And what is native Macau culture ?
This is Carlos Marreiros 's story .
The story began during the era of great sailing ships .
Four hundred years ago , a Portuguese trading vessel dropped anchor off the island of Macau , intent on doing business with imperial China .
That one brief rest stop destined Macau to become a cultural montage that includes Chinese , Indian , Malay , Portuguese and other European influences .
Today , Macaense -LRB- or Macanese -RRB- , the free mix of the various ethnic currents of Macau has become the most vibrant element of its culture .
" Without it , Macau would n't exist , " says Carlos Marreiros , who once served as director of the Macau government 's bureau of culture , and now works as an architect , painter , author and poet .
Ethnic melting pot
Marreiros is a typical Macanese .
His grandfather was Portuguese , his grandmother Chinese .
His mother has a mix of Spanish and Malay blood .
In Macau , he 's what is known as a " local Portuguese . "
Marreiros was born in Macau , but " most of my education took place in Europe , " he says .
He attended university in Lisbon , received his master 's degree in Germany , and went on to study landscaping in Sweden .
His principal impressions of China come from his family and his contacts with Chinese people .
When he was young , Marreiros worked in a Macau post office .
One of his coworkers was a Chinese of the older generation , who often chatted with him about Tang - dynasty poetry , and Chinese proverbs and myths .
For a while Marreiros taught Chinese people how to speak Portuguese .
" I learned quite a lot about the way many Chinese people think , " he says .
Carlos Marreiros speaks fluent Portuguese , Cantonese , English and German .
He has done research on traditional Chinese poetry , and has included some in his Portuguese - language writings .
He personally manifests a blend of Chinese and Western influences .
Marreiros emphasizes that in addition to Chinese and Portuguese influences , Macau also has its own unique blend of culture - Macaense , which is exhibited in " local Portuguese " of mixed ancestry such as himself .
" The world 's first mixed-race culture appeared in Macau , " he says .
Now with the convenience of travel and transportation , the intermingling of black , white and yellow peoples is nothing new , but 400 years ago , the people of Macau intertwined cultures from as far afield as India , Southeast Asia and Japan .
Their influences can be seen everywhere in the cuisine , architecture and literature of Macau .
Intellectual assets
In the enclave 's restaurants , such classic Macanese dishes as curry and Portuguese chicken are served up with a wide variety of seasonings , blending the sweet flavors of Cantonese dishes with the rich , tangy taste of old-style Indian fare .
One example is Macanese baoguo , a combination of Chinese sausage , cabbage and tripe - not precisely Portuguese , nor Cantonese either .
The exteriors of traditional Macau buildings are noticeably southern European in style .
But Marreiros , an architect , points out that while the outsides of many houses are European , the arrangement of rooms and furniture inside is often done in a Chinese manner .
" The important space is given to the father and the eldest son .
The remaining side rooms are for the ladies of the house and others - quite different from Portuguese architecture , " he says .
And the details of ornamentation , such as engravings , glasswork and wood carvings , are actually rendered in Qing - dynasty fashion .
The most representative example is Macau 's oldest church , Sao Paolo -LRB- the ruins of St. Paul 's -RRB- .
Its surviving stone facade is embellished with stone carvings not only of such Catholic images as angels and the Virgin Mary , but also of dragon - and - phoenix motifs and fishing boats , as well as Catholic phrases written in Chinese characters .
Marreiros believes that the hybrid culture of Macau is its greatest asset .
" Macau is so small .
It has no land for industry or agriculture .
All it has to rely on is intellect , " he says .
Three hundred years ago , missionaries in Macau built the first university in the Far East , the Jesuit College of St. Paul 's .
Since the 1980s , Macau has established six institutes of higher learning .
" Macau 's population is young , and the average educational level is quite high , " he notes .
Four hundred years of cultural intercourse between Occident and Orient has left behind enormous assets in Macau , and the enclave 's people have the ability to form a bridge of exchange between East and West .
Now that Macau 's sovereignty has switched hands , Marreiros has chosen not to return to his motherland of Portugal , but to remain behind .
" Macau is my home .
My heart is in Macau , " he says .
Marreiros is a person of Macau , part Portuguese and part Chinese .
A diversity of cultures will only enrich a person , not create a crisis of identity .
For Taiwanese people , who have questions about their own identity and often ask themselves who they are , what thoughts does Carlos Marreiros 's story bring to mind ?
