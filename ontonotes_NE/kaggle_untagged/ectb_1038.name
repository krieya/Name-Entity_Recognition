Internet Pioneer Heidi Hsueh
When the Internet started to take off in Taiwan in 1995 , Inforian was one of the first Taiwan Internet startups .
In the years since it has made quite a splash in the industry .
Back when the Internet in Taiwan mainly meant college students posting on bulletin boards and fooling around with Mosaic , a 23 - year - old graduate student at National Chengchi University named Heidi Hsueh and a graduate student at National Taiwan University named Lawrence Ho decided to form an Internet company together .
They started with just NT$ 500,000 .
Hsueh , who speaks with all the self - confidence of a prophet , recalls that she could early on see the tremendous impact that the Internet was going to have on people s lives .
" We were riding that first wave , " says Hsueh , who points out that deciding to strike at the right time is the first step to success .
Starting with books
In the early period , Inforian - or pAsia as it is known today - made money by publishing books and by localizing software for the Taiwan market .
Hsueh , the co-founder and executive vice president , ca n't count how many times she stayed up all night at the office in those early days .
Once , when their distributor for some reason refused to make payments , they had to endure two months without any incoming revenue .
" When you 're considering founding a company , " she says , issuing a warning to the many youths throwing themselves into Internet startups , " you 've really got to consider carefully the pressures you 're going to be under . "
The division of labor was clear from the start .
Ho was responsible for product design , and Hsueh handled business development and marketing strategy .
After two years , the company had its first success : the IQ97 -LRB- Inforian Quest -RRB- meta - search engine .
It hit a homerun for their Internet dreams .
Not long after Ho finished IQ97 , Hsueh sent it to the American website ZDNet , which awarded it five stars , its highest rating .
Hsueh then used the Internet to find distributors around the world .
Soon IQ97 had been translated into seven languages and plans were laid to step into the global market .
Within a year of the product 's release in October of 1997 , it had sold three million copies worldwide .
Inforian followed by launching CICQ , a Chinese language instant messaging site that attracted 1 million members from around the world .
Then in 1998 it focused on e-commerce , establishing the online auction site CoolBid , which has averaged quarterly sales of NT$ 60 million and has as many as 100,000 members .
Hsueh also made plans to forge alliances with world - famous companies .
In 1998 , after seeing Hsueh 's strategic alliance plan , Intel joined Inforian as a strategic partner .
Later , it decided to take a stake in the company .
It was the first time Intel had ever invested in an Asian Internet company .
Inforian , or pAsia as it is now known , has grown from four employees to a staff of several hundred , and has become a multinational with offices in the United States and on the mainland , as well as in Taiwan .
The Internet lifestyle
" At pAsia we emphasize that the Internet is a kind of technological art that allows people to improve their lifestyle , " Hsueh says .
" This is a work of art that requires creativity to be whole .
The Internet is part software , part media , part databank , and part communications device .
It 's the best possible space for making the most out of creativity .
" On the front door to the company 's office on Hsinyi Road , Leonardo DaVinci , Albert Einstein and the pAsia logo grace each other with their respective presences .
Hsueh notes that those two historical figures ' hard work and creativity changed the way people live .
This is also the spirit that pAsia wishes to project .
As far as Hsueh is concerned , the Internet is both a tool and a communications platform .
Internet companies , she believes , should reflect that .
As one such company , pAsia must be flexible , efficient and practice what it preaches .
The intranet at pAsia , for instance , provides chatrooms , vacation request forms , work guidelines , business travel forms , and even a bulletin board for selling workers ' second - hand stuff .
The offices have neon decorations on the walls and a hallway that is no less stylish than a haute couture catwalk .
The whole office is infused with a modern and technological sensibility .
Of course , success is never guaranteed .
American Tech stocks took a tumble in April of this year , and people began to talk about an Internet bubble .
Meanwhile , pAsia has had trouble obtaining new financing and has seen rapid turnover in its executive ranks , while rumors have circulated about its IPO application being rejected .
Nevertheless , Hsueh holds that pAsia has a clear niche and is very adaptable , so that it will be relatively unaffected by the economic downturn .
When you see Heidi Hsueh 's fresh young face and her no - nonsense approach to doing business , you quickly understand how members of the young generation are realizing their revolutionary ideas about lifestyle and career through the Internet .
