For a late update , live from the campaign trail we 're joined by NBC News correspondent Campbell Brown Ho who 's traveling with the Bush effort , and NBC News correspondent Chip Reid travel traveling with the Gore campaign in Kansas City Missouri .
Good evening to you .
Good evening , Brian .
Well , Bush ended the day with a big rally here .
We 're just outside of Tampa .
And I 'll tell you , these evening rallies really have the feel of a rock concert , or maybe a pro wrestling match .
You have strobe lights , you have screaming crowds , all designed to make Bush look like a winner .
But he is not a winner yet in Florida .
There is one new poll out that actually puts Gore ahead here .
There are still several polls that say Bush is still ahead in Florida .
Bottom line , as we heard David Gregory report , this is not the position the campaign wanted to be in at this stage of the game .
Bush 's central message on this bu bus trip across central Florida today was to his diehard supporters telling them go out , tell your friends still on the fence why they need to vote for me , and it 's a message the campaign hopes it was able to convey today , because while Florida is a must - win , they also can not ignore the other battleground states .
Brian tomorrow morning , Bush flies to Pennsylvania , another swing state with 2023 electoral votes , just two less than Florida .
Pennsylvania traditionally , a Democratic state , but one where there 's a popular Republican governor , Tom Ridge , and there 's a lot of pressure on Ridge right now to deliver Pennsylvania .
He 'll end up tomorrow night in Ohio , and then end the week in another two crucial states , Wisconsin and Michigan .
Thank you for that .
