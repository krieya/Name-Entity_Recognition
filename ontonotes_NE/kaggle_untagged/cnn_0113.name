Hello , I 'm Kathleen Kennedy , sitting in for Chuck Roberts .
We begin this half hour with the latest developments in the presidential election .
Thousands of disputed ballots in South Florida are being prepared for shipment to the state capital amid tight security .
A Tallahassee judge wants them in case they are needed as evidence in a lawsuit challenging Florida 's certified vote , but there are growing signs state lawmakers could step in and decide the winner .
Jonathan Aiken reports .
State legislators in Florida 's capitol are discussing if a special session is needed to decide which 25 electors will represent Florida in the Electoral College -- a Democratic slate ? or a Republican slate ?
U.S. law allows state legislatures to choose representatives to the Electoral College as a last resort .
Florida lawmakers may go that route , if the disputed recount is n't settled by December six days before the Electoral College meets to verify the results of the presidential election .
Experts are telling Florida 's lawmakers to act cautiously .
The right to vote is clearly protected by the First Amendment .
I think that your action needs to take that into consideration .
As lawmakers consider their options , the legal fight over the recount continues at several levels .
In Leon County , which includes Tallahassee , Circuit Court Judge N. Sanders Sauls ordered 13,000 contested ballots from Miami - Dade and Palm Beach counties to be brought to Tallahassee by Saturday .
That 's when he 'll decide if they should be counted , along with contested ballots from Nassau County .
Miami - Dade County , for one , is heavily Democratic , and it 's from these areas , Gore officials believe , that a hand count of ballots will turn up enough votes to overcome Governor Bush 's lead .
In West Palm Beach Wednesday , an independent , conservative group called Judicial Watch asked a court to let it see those ballots for itself .
We 're here for the public , for the public should know what 's going on without two adversaries that are fighting with each other .
The Gore camp would prefer the ballot counting from all disputed counties start immediately .
It 's concerned the public is losing patience with the legal challenges to the Florida vote .
As this host of legal actions makes its way through the Florida court system , attention is turning to the legal body of last resort in the United States -- the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington .
Oral arguments will be heard Friday on a request by the Bush campaign to overturn a decision by Florida 's Supreme Court .
It ruled that recounts submitted to state officials after a filing deadline had passed had to be counted .
