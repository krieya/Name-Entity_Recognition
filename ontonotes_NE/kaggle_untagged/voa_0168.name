The Clinton administration is expressing confidence the UN Security Council will vote next week to tighten sanctions against Afghanistan 's dominant Taliban faction .
Assistant US Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs Carl Enderforth said on Friday the Taliban 's refusal to comply with a UN anti-terrorism resolution last year forced the move to toughen sanctions .
He says trade and humanitarian shipments of food and medicine as well as religious pilgrimages will not be affected .
