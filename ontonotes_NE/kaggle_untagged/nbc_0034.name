NBC News `` In Depth '' tonight .
Hillary Rodham Clinton made history today -- the first ever First Lady to be elected to public office and the world 's most exclusive club -- the U.S. Senate .
After spending most of her life in support of her husband 's political career , watching him get sworn in over and over again it was his turn today to watch from the sidelines as she took the oath of office .
Our `` In Depth '' report tonight , from NBC 's Andrea Mitchell .
She is first among equals , America 's first First Lady politician .
Will you raise your right hand --
97th in seniority , but when the oath is later re-enacted for all the senators , she jumps to the head of the line , even ahead of Republican leader Trent Lott --
`` security concerns '' for her husband , officials claim .
For this political wife , friends say , a dream come true .
Today he holds the Bible for her , trading places from when they first came to Washington eight years ago .
From the health care fiasco to the Monica humiliation -- I did not have sexual relations with that woman , to the campaign many said she could never win , Hillary Clinton is now the most admired woman in America , beating Oprah by a landslide in the latest Gallup poll .
I am thrilled .
I could n't be more proud .
I could not be more happy .
I am very grateful to the people of New York , and I think she will do them proud .
It was really a very moving moment for both of us .
I kept looking at him in the gallery with my daughter , and , you know , it was very emotional for me .
But how will she fit in among 99 other ambitious politicians ?
The Senate has 100 people who think they can be President , and she is only one of them , but she is different .
For instance , the senior senator from New York is hardly camera - shy .
I 'll make you this promise -- I will do my best not to steal Hillary 's limelight .
And while Chuck Schumer bunks on work nights with three fellow congressmen in this rowhouse and other freshmen senators rent small apartments -- I got two bedrooms and a sofa bed so my children can come when they feel like it , Hillary and her husband buy a new $ 2.8 million mansion .
She needs an address , and I 'd like to have someplace to come see her .
Friends even register her china , a soup tureen goes for more than $ 2,000 , but now that she 's sworn in , Senate ethics rules forbid gifts worth more than $ 100 .
She 'll have to rely on her husband 's earnings and her $ 8 million book deal , but she 's still being entertained by friends .
How are you ?
Tonight , at a party hosted by Democratic fund - raiser Walter Kay , the supporter who first sent a young intern named Monica to the Clinton White House .
