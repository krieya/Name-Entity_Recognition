The Mariners can move on to the American League Champion SHN Series with a win over the White Sox this afternoon .
Seattle is obviously upbeat and relaxed after taking the first two games in Chicago .
I think this team is energized .
I think we feel real good , and , you know , after that Anaheim series , I think this whole team took a deep breath of relief and said , Okay , we 're finally in , Let 's go out and do our thing .
As long as we go out and have fun and laugh and , you know , I think it takes a lot of pressure off of everyone , but the key is going out and having fun , laughing and joking around , you know , doing the little things that we 've been doing all year .
