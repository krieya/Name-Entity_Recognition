After the devastating and disgraceful failure whether at the world championship level or even at the continental championship level , like now in Doha in Asia , personally and on behalf of the female gender , I express to you , the young men of Saudi Arabia , our complete readiness as members of the female gender , to watch you bring about the defeat this time of Doha in Qatar .
And in any international forum , as you have accustomed us to , and in every challenge to human strength which attests to what the human body can achieve in its strength and precision , its patience and art . We are ready to pat you on the back and caress your shoulders , console you in your sadness , wipe the tears from your cheeks . And to recite the prayers of the old ladies asking the Creator to compensate you with better championships next time .
It has become the norm to receive Saudi youth empty - handed .
It has become the norm for you , the young men , not to raise the flag of monotheism among the flags of nations .
It has become the expected scenario that we only hear from you , young men , promises about the coming championships .
Because each championship is followed by another , there is no definite time as to how close the era of challenge is or the golden era when medallions are drawn on your chests , not in the near future nor even in eternity .
Despite all your failures we find you depriving us , the female gender , and in a discriminating way , of engaging in challenging the nations .
We find the public welfare -LRB- of youth -RRB- limiting its activity to a gender that confirms its failure not once and not even a thousand times .
Why not open the doors for girls to exercise their human rights , to confirm their freedom which was guaranteed by religion , law , and humanity , so they can stand tall holding the flag that says " There is no god except God , and Muhammad is the messenger of God " among the rest of the girls of the Asian continent ?
