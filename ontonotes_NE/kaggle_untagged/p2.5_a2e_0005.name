Next week , God willing , the water and electricity bills will start to be distributed in one bill .
The Minister of Water and Electricity will be available in the Saudi Company for Electricity -LRB- in the Kharis service area in the Roda district -RRB- to launch the start of distribution , after the implementation of the project is completed without any media fuss , in order to avoid public opinion , which causes a big fuss , refusing this merge .
The Saudi Channel started preparing for the issue two days ago and asked citizens about their opinion on consolidating the water and electricity bills .
The only reason for their merge is very , very silly ; namely , the designation of the Ministry of Water and Electricity by this name requires also a consolidated bill for water and electricity .
The fine for disconnecting the electricity meter and turning back the reading is ten riyals , and the fine for pilfering water is two hundred riyals .
Will the fine for pilfering water be consolidated with the electricity one to be ten riyals ?
Brother , what are the repercussions of these bills on a large section of citizens who can barely pay the electricity bill itself ?
Why should you care about the water and electricity bill ?
Did n't this minister see the women sitting in front of the entrance to Kharis Services with the electricity bills in their hands , pleading for the reviewers to help them pay them ?
The news is correct and 100 % confirmed , for correspondence .
