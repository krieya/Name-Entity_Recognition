My brother Hamid , The decision to close down the group is basically up to you .
Maybe this decision will encourage some to create their own groups or participate more .
I do not know .
In all cases , the correspondence gave everyone including me the opportunity to communicate and learn about other different views .
In this respect , I am grateful for this effort .
I would like to know the primary goal that you perceived when you decided to proceed with this initiative .
Maybe then I can understand your decision to close it , if that is what you want , of course .
My view on this matter is that it has - the group - accomplished some sort of achievement .
The obvious negativity from some does not mean that you will not face negativity in life , in the community .
This is important .
In addition to the fear that some might have - from the security aspect - who are burdened with ideas rejecting the other , and maybe the desire to eliminate him and ca n't frankly and openly express their ideas to the extent that they desire .
This is understandable .
I previously informed those who want to participate in a blog I started , on -LRB- blogger -RRB- but got no response .
Later I learned that the blogger was blocked .
I hope this is the reason and not the intellectual guardianship or the spiral self - withdrawal :--LRB-
Despite my feeling for several times that you and I do not agree , I wish you prosperity and luck .
Greetings .
