Even if the township of Linpien does n't have a monopoly on the cultivation of " black pearl " wax apples , it was orchards in the Linpien locality that earned black pearls their national renown .
A little town formerly notorious for its ground subsidence problem , Linpien is now turning itself into one of Southern Taiwan 's premier tourist attractions .
The impetus for this change has come chiefly from local historians , along with various voluntary groups .
Just before Christmas break , the rural township of Linpien , on the Pingtung Plain at the mouth of the Linpien river , held its first ever Wax Apple Festival .
The festival , in the town 's riverside park , was held to promote black pearl wax apples and celebrate the local volunteer spirit .
It was a scorching hot day , and heavily perspiring visitors were to be seen wandering among the stalls , lugging bags of wax apples and commenting on their remarkable sweetness .
" There 's a lot more than you 'd think to growing wax apples , " says local farmer Chen Sheng - tzung .
" How you take care of the orchards , which equipment you use - it all has an affect on the shape and texture of the fruit . "
Prices for wax apples range widely , from around 3 pounds for NT$ 100 to NT$ 150 a pound .
Fruit that shows a hint of black through the red color of the skin fetches the best price .
Huang Wan - fu , whose family farms two hectares of orchard with more than 700 wax apple trees , and who has over 30 years ' experience as a fruit grower , says that while other parts of Pingtung County also grow wax apples , " Linpien stands out for its growing techniques , developed through trial and error by the growers themselves , and for vernalization rates of up to 90 % . "
Ugly duckling no more
The wax apple is a tropical fruit originating from the Malay peninsula .
The Dutch brought it to Taiwan from Java , in the 17th century , and it became commonly grown as a shade - giving tree .
Old folk in the South remember when wax apples were " just something to munch on " - the kind of fruit that grew freely and that you could help yourself to .
But wax apples have increased in value during the past 30 years , thanks to advances in the way that they are grown .
For example , the " bag - wrap " method was originally a way of protecting budding fruit from birds , but once it was introduced to Linpien , in around 1994 , farmers found it enabled them to grow more lustrous , shiny - looking wax apples , with less pesticide on the skin .
The method soon caught on throughout the district .
Another popular technique involves covering the trees with black mosquito nets to improve yields .
This reduces the amount of sunlight reaching the trees , causing nutrients from the leaves and branches to be diverted into producing fruit .
The net - covered trees blossom earlier and produce more fruit .
As a result of this technique , black pearl wax apples are now available throughout most of the year .
The " black pearl " tag did n't originate in Linpien , but it was Linpien wax apples that made the variety famous and prompted the dramatic growth of its market .
In 1983 the then - provincial governor Lee Teng - hui visited the town and praised the quality of its black pearl wax apples , so assuring the renown of the fruit .
Subsequently , as president , Lee Teng - hui often gave gifts of black pearl wax apples to foreign dignitaries .
Green hills
The success of black pearl wax apples gave Linpien a much - needed boost , bringing some of the younger generation back to the area to grow the fruit .
The credit for putting wax apples at the heart of the town 's revival and for mounting the Wax Apple Festival belongs with a group of volunteer workers - local people committed to the town 's regeneration .
How does a small town like Linpien come to be home to such a well - organized volunteer effort , and just how did the volunteers set about giving their town a make - over ?
The story begins with the town 's riverside park .
The road linking the town 's main street with the riverside park , where locals like to stroll and chat at the beginning and end of the day , used to be overgrown and lined with trash .
Now , however , thanks to a coordinated effort involving volunteers , residents and landlords , the verges are planted with sunflowers and lantana , while a former mud patch , donated rent - free by its owner , has been converted into a carp - filled lotus pool .
The revamping of Linpien started eight or nine years ago , when schoolteacher Tsao Chi - hung - now a DPP deputy in the national legislature - along with fellow members of the Linpien Residents ' Democracy Association launched a program to sweep the streets and keep the riverbank clean .
Wu Wu - ta , a plumber who runs the Democracy Association , says : " People were already doing their bit for the community over ten years ago , but not openly .
They swept the streets before dawn because they did n't want people to see them and call them crazy . "
It was only three years ago , with the founding of the non-political Linpien Natural History Conservation Association , that residents began to publicly support the project .
The flood - prone Linpien River has been dyked and dredged since the Japanese colonial era , but the bare concrete embankments never did much for the scenery .
In 1999 Tsao Chi - hung learned that the Water Conservancy Bureau was planning to renovate the flood defenses , and he proposed a scheme for " greenification " of the riverside area .
Objections were raised , however , with some pointing out that the site , if left untended , could easily get overgrown and become a breeding ground for snakes and vermin .
The issue was discussed and finally the Bureau agreed to let volunteers maintain the riverside area for two years .
If the scheme did n't work out then the Bureau would concrete over the site as originally planned .
Following the lead of the conservation association and the Democracy Association , various volunteer groups in the district - including the senior citizens ' club , members of Tzu Chi Buddhist Foundation , the Presbyterian Church , and followers of the I - Kuan Tao sect - signed up to share responsibility for the riverside park , which was divided into 90 - meter - long plots for the purpose .
Turf was laid , flower beds appeared , and the embankment soon became a 1.2 km - long " green Great Wall . "
Dreaming by the river
" You ca n't go about community work in a standoffish way , and you certainly ca n't operate effectively from behind the scenes - you have to be out there at the front of things .
When local people see teachers and doctors coming out to collect trash , they feel encouraged to join in , " says Chen Chin - chao , a dentist who chairs the Linpien Natural History Conservation Association .
Chen frets about the way the media has focused the spotlight on him alone , when numerous other individuals are also involved , all chipping in what they can .
" The biggest achievement is that the flowers have n't been stolen , " says Tsao Chi - hung .
" As more people volunteer to help , disruptive behavior becomes less and less likely . "
The riverside area used to be a teenage hangout , known for its drinking and fighting , but since greenification the town 's residents have been coming here to stroll and enjoy the scenery : green hills to the East , the sunset in the West , and the dreamy river alongside the park .
" The more that people get involved the greater their sense of accomplishment , " says Tsao .
" It 's not just about tidying up the environment .
We also hope to foster the commercial interests of the community so as to bring practical benefits for people 's lives . "
This was the thinking behind Tsao 's gathering together of various groups for the Wax Apple Festival .
According to the archives , 400 years ago Linpien was a plains - aborigine settlement called " Fang - suo - she . "
In the middle of the 17th century the Ming dynasty loyalist Zheng Chenggong -LRB- also known as Koxinga -RRB- brought an influx of settlers to Taiwan from the Fujian and Guangdong regions of China .
Some of the Fang - suo - she aborigines stayed and intermarried with Chinese , while others moved away .
The oldest recorded use of the name " Linpien " is on a stele , erected in 1762 , next to the town 's Sanshan King Temple .
The name , which means " beside the forest , " indicates that the early settlers must have had a tough time clearing land for their crops .
Moving to center - stage
In the past half century or more Linpien has concentrated on a series of different forms of produce , from rice , to bananas , to prawn and eel farming , to wax apples - today 's main crop .
With Taiwan 's imminent accession to the WTO , the next big change could be just around the corner .
For example , will wax apples lose their market to imported fruit ?
And what does Linpien have to offer that other districts in the county ca n't easily duplicate ?
Yang Hung - jen , a PhD student at National Taiwan University 's Graduate Institute of Sociology , came to Linpien a year ago to research his thesis on the renewal of the local community .
" I had come to what was said to be the worst county in Taiwan for factionalism and corruption , " says Yang , " a place where the ground had sunk as much as three meters due to subsidence .
But the contrast between that image and what I actually found here was quite something . "
For Yang , the way that those most active in the renewal effort routinely pass the credit to others is itself impressive .
Linpien rose to prominence on the strength of its celebrated wax apples .
But can it now push its way to center - stage as a tourist attraction ?
Says Chen Chin - chao : " We ca n't yet say how things will turn out for Linpien .
But that 's not to be pessimistic about the town 's prospects ; it 's simply a case of not building castles in the air . "
Development of the long - promised Tapeng Bay Scenic Area is due to begin , and in 2003 the 2nd Southern Freeway will open .
Will this bring more prosperity to the area ?
Construction of a bypass around the town has already boosted property values , but what other benefits may it bring ?
A golf course is mooted , but will that mean the loss of birdwatching zones and the mangrove woods ?
Can the wax apple orchards be adapted to serve as a setting for family outings ?
And can fish farms in the locality be converted to provide housing and accommodation , and a recreation alternative for visitors ?
Can this little town make an asset of its scenic location and historical roots to attract more visitors ?
Linpien used to be little more than a brief stop for travelers on their way to the seaside resort of Kenting , but now its residents are wondering if they can turn the town into a destination in its own right .

Aquaculture provides for full nets and full bellies , but it is also the culprit behind Linpien 's severe subsidence problem .
The acreage of fish farms has halved in recent years , due to the combination of falling profits and environmental degradation .
p. 47
Subsidence has been caused by the over-extraction of ground - water for aquaculture .
Some of the houses on the Linpien - Chiatung coastal strip have sunk to the degree that their windows are level with the street and their rooves are within easy reach .
