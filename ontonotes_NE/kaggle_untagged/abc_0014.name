Once again there 'll be two presidential candidates missing from the debate .
Pat Buchanan hardly registers on the political radar this year .
And Ralph Nader , who may make the difference between a Gore or Bush win in several places .
ABC 's Linda Douglas was with his campaign over the weekend .
Ralph Nader says his campaign is starting to take off .
Do you feel momentum from last night ?
Yeah .
Well , it was pretty big .
7777
At a Nader rally in Madison Square Garden , 15,000 people joined actors Tim Robbins , Susan Sarandon and other stars to hear his message -- that average Americans are powerless .
They have lost control of their government .
They have lost control of their workplace .
Nader condemns corporations , drug companies , pesticide manufacturers , banks , landlords , the media .
His supporters say they do n't care that he has no chance to become President .
I want to see my vote as a statement that I will no longer compromise .
Nader says George Bush and Al Gore are essentially corrupt .
Here 's the difference between Bush and Gore when it comes to corporate power .
It 's velocity with which their knees hit the floor when corporations knock on their doors .
Applause
In a year when most candidates are afraid of appearing negative , Ralph Nader attacks his rivals with gusto .
George W. Bush is really a big corporation running for President disguised as a human being .
But Nader is most critical of Al Gore , often when speaking to Democrats .
He has betrayed , he has lied , he has deceived , he has dissembled .
Democrats fear Nader may make a difference in some key states , like Washington and Wisconsin , luring voters away from Gore and handing the election to Bush .
You know , some of the Democrats are going to blame you if Gore loses .
They ought to blame themselves .
Who do you think is going to win this year ?
I do n't know .
It 's very close .
Do you care ?
No .
He says this year 's campaign is really about the next election , about building a serious third party and qualifying for federal campaign money .
Thanks for running .
Thanks for voting .
Nader is never happier than when he is taking on the system .
