More than half of the UEFA Champions League games have already taken place , and basically many strong teams are guaranteed access to the elimination series .
Although the focus of this round is on the match between Basa and Chelsea , there is little doubt that they would jointly enter the quarter - finals .
But the situation is very complicated in Group B ; if Bayern does its best and judging by their abilities , they should entirely demolish the Sporting Lisbon .
Internazionale Milan has lost the previous two matches to the opponents , but now they have finally began to explode ; it remains to be seen if such an explosion would be too late .
On the 4th day of the matches , Internazionale Milan would be in freezing - cold Moscow ; Spartak is the only team that uses artificial turf , and it will be a great test for the Internazionale Milan .
Inter Milan is without its four key players , Cambiasso , Recoba , Adriano , and Vieira .
With the absence of these four players , it is estimated that Internazionale Milan might be significantly affected .
If they can not score three points in this match , their mission of acquiring the championship basically comes to an end .
There are some other games where the outcomes are fairly certain from my point of view .
Both the English Super and Italy 's Serie A have their advantages to some extent ; but Italy 's Serie A play two games within a week , and this would put their physical abilities to the test .
Especially for the Internazionale Milan , who exerted tremendous effort in trying to win the big game against AC Milan in the Derby war ; now they must be mentally and physically exhausted after they arrived in Moscow
