But first to the serious business --
George W. Bush 's nominees for his cabinet are still getting a going - over in Congress and President Clinton is causing a mild stir here by his reluctance to slide out of the spotlight .
Mr. Clinton asked for seven minutes on television tonight to say good-bye and he will get it , from us .
Here first , down at the White House is ABC 's Jock Cochran .
He will point out challenges facing Mr. Bush tonight , implied and that is some disapproval for Mr. Bush 's tax cut proposals .
He will also say America must stay engaged with the world , and the President will talk about the importance of building one America , including racial reconciliation .
Mr. Clinton hopes history will look kindly on tonight 's speech , but history ignores most presidential farewells .
Exceptions include the first one , from George Washington , and war hero Dwight Eisenhower 's surprising warning about the influence of the Pentagon .
Richard Nixon made the history books , but only because he said -- I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow .
Even the Great Communicator , Ronald Reagan , got only middling marks for his farewell .
America is respected again in the world and looked to for leadership .
George Bush the Elder left by saying nothing -- no farewell address .
`` It would just be an ego trip , '' he told friends .
Would n't be prudent , but Bill Clinton could not pass up his last chance to use the bully pulpit .
This is someone who wants to create a place for himself in the politics of the future , even if it 's simply campaigning at the side of his wife .
Therefore , what Bill Clinton says tonight is said in large part with an eye to his own political future , but for Bill Clinton , tonight 's speech is a real change , for , as you noted , Peter , this one will be short -- very short , only about seven minutes .
Short for Bill Clinton , certainly .
Thanks , John Cochran .
