Welcome to another hour of news and information on The Voice of America .
I 'm David Chadwick with VOA News Now .
President Clinton is criticizing a proposal to open up food and medicine sales to Cuba , but toughen restrictions on travel there .
VOA 's David Swan reports .
The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the measure next week .
Mr. Clinton says he will withhold final judgment until he sees details of the plan , which Members of Congress hammered out Thursday night , but he tells reporters that if the deal was what it appears to be , the lawmakers made a big mistake .
It looks like it eases the embargo on food and medicine , but it probably does n't very much because it does n't provide any financing credits , which we give to other poor countries , whereas it definitely restricts the ability of the executive branch to increase people - to - people contacts between Americans and Cubans .
The agreement which is part of a larger foreign bill , came after more than a year of political warfare and bargaining over the always sensitive subject of Cuba .
The measure would allow American food and medicine to be sold there for the first time in close to 40 years .
It also applies to four other nations where trade has been restricted , Iran , Sudan , Libya and North Korea , but Cuban - American House Members who fiercely oppose anything that might ease pressure on President Castro demanded concessions .
So , as Mr. Clinton noted , the plan bars American banks from financing the food sales , which means Havana would have to pay cash or obtain credits from third countries .
Another part of the legislation would tighten restrictions on American travel to Cuba .
The Castro government has already rejected the deal , saying it will not buy anything under these terms .
In contrast , the proposal supporters call it an opening to Cuba and an important shift in policy .
One leading farm group , the American Farm Bureau Federation describes it as a positive first step and much better than current law .
It appears Congress is not prepared to take any bigger steps on the issue this year .
