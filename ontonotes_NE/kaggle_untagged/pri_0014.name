One of the largest cases of alleged sexual abuse by a Catholic priest is being settled .
The archdiocese of Portland has apologized to 22 men who say they were molested by an Oregon priest when they were altar boys .
Jeff Brady reports from Oregon Public Broadcasting .
The men say they were abused by Maurice Grammond as far back as 50 years ago .
As part of the settlement , the men will receive money though the exact amount is being kept confidential .
The agreement also calls for an apology from the Portland Archdiocese that will be read from the pulpit of every parish in Western Oregon at Sunday Mass .
Attorney David Slater represented the alleged victims .
These men were burdened through their childhood , and into adulthood , and even in the middle age with an overwhelming sense of shame and isolation .
With few exceptions they kept this experience and the shame around it a secret even from their own wives .
Maurice Grammond is now 80 and lives in the Alzheimer 's unit of a nursing home .
He never faced criminal charges for the alleged abuse because the statute of limitations expired long ago .
