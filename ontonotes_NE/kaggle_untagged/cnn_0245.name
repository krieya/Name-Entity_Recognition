I just want to update you on Kofi Annan 's remarks .
The U.N. Secretary - General did not answer questions on Iraq as a result .
There 's nothing to report on that front .
We have just gotten word from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that that court has now put on hold its ruling banning the Pledge of Allegiance in public classrooms .
Schools in nine Western states would have been prohibited from having students say the pledge starting Monday .
The stay was granted to give the school districts involved in the initial cases 90 days to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court here in Washington .
The appeals court ruled last summer , but the phrase under God which was added to the pledge in the 1950s is an unconstitutional endorsement of religion .
We 'll continue to follow this court ruling as well .
Here 's how you 're weighing in on our web question of the day .
Remember when we 've been asking you this question , Who is the number one threat facing the U.S. ? Is it Saddam Hussein , Kim Jong Il or Osama Bin Laden ?
Look at the results .
13 % of you say Saddam Hussein .
14 % of you who voted say Kim Jong Il .
41 % say Osama bin Laden .
Remember , this is not , not a 13 , 46 , 4 1 , those are the numbers .
You see them , 13 % for Saddam Hussein , 46 % for Kim Jong Il , 41 % for Osama bin Laden .
Remember this , ask not a scientific poll .
