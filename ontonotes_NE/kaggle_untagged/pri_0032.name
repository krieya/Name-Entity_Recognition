At the United Nations , UN Secretary General Kofi Annan says the level of violence is still too high .
Linda Bascilla reports from the UN .
Kofi Annan played a major role in bringing about the emergency summit earlier this week in Egypt , and now after briefing the UN Security Council on his efforts , he made it clear that while violence has decreased some it is nowhere near the level which he thinks is satisfactory .
The UN chief also said that tensions were still high and that the next 48 to 72 hours would be crucial .
He expressed hope that both Israelis and Palestinians would stick to the Sharm el - Sheikh agreement and continue to implement it .
Meanwhile , Annan also told reporters that he hoped the UN General Assembly would send a conciliatory message to both sides encouraging them to implement the agreement .
