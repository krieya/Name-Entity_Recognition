Little Three Links Presage New Era in Cross-Strait Relations
-LRB- Sharon Wu / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
The " little three links " - direct mail , transport , and commerce between the ROC islands of Kinmen and Matsu on the one side and the PRC on the other - were formally opened on January 2 .
-LRB- They were originally supposed to start on January 1 , but were postponed to the 2nd at the request of the PRC . -RRB-
This step is seen as setting the stage for the eventual opening of the full " three links " - direct mail , commerce , and transport between Taiwan proper and the PRC - and for Taiwan 's entry into the World Trade Organization .
But the PRC has remained as chilly as ever , and it is uncertain what breakthroughs and benefits can be realized through the little three links .
It is expected that both Taiwan and the PRC will enter the WTO this year .
Looking ahead , with the alteration of the previous administration 's " no haste " policy , cross-strait trade relations will enter a new era .
On December 20 , Premier Chang Chun - hsiung declared that the opening of the little three links on January 1 was a major part of the government 's mainland policy , and also the prelude to the full three links that will be implemented after WTO entry .
Tsai Ing - wen , chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Commission -LRB- MAC -RRB- , says that the focus in the first stage of the little three links will be on the issues of public security and the local economy in Kinmen and Matsu .
The first step will be decriminalization and legalization of petty trade .
Only after observing the impact of the first stage on social order and local industries in Kinmen and Matsu will the second stage - opening of normal commercial activities - be considered .
As for the opening of the full three links , there is no particular timetable .
On December 18 , MAC Vice-Chairman Teng Chen - chung stated that the government has already begun planning for the full three links .
Faced with questions raised by some legislators that the government is focusing on the little three links as a tactic to postpone the full three links , Teng declared that the full three links will definitely be implemented , but the first priority is to coordinate these with Taiwan 's WTO entry , with secondary attention going to Taiwan 's own needs .
Most media and commentators have been positive toward the little three links .
In an article published on December 25 , the United Daily News declared that , given the trend of economic globalization , the opening of the three links across the Taiwan Strait should bring unprecedented growth in cross-strait economic ties .
In addition , promoting economic links is something that both sides find acceptable despite the frigid nature of the political relationship .
As the borderless global economy takes shape in the 21st century , the three links will help businesses expand their economic space and encourage industrial upgrading , with both sides benefiting .
But PRC economic experts note that , once both sides enter the WTO , the mainland 's large market will be contested by firms from all over the world .
They say that the transfer of high technology firms from Taiwan to the PRC will aid in construction of a " Chinese economic grouping " which would raise the decision - making status of the two sides in international economic affairs .
On another front , in terms of tourism , in June of 2001 Taiwan expects to implement a new policy allowing mainland tourists to come to Taiwan .
This could be very significant in increasing exchanges and mutual understanding between the two sides .
Most opinion leaders in the PRC view this policy positively .
Beijing 's China Travel Association says that mainland people can now travel for tourism to 15 regions or countries , and it is a shame that Taiwan - which is close geographically and shares a common language and heritage - has never been open for mainland travelers .
A recent opinion poll in the PRC shows that 25 million people there say that they would rather visit Taiwan than any other tourist destination .
Mt. Ali -LRB- Alishan -RRB- and Sun Moon Lake are the places in Taiwan they would most like to visit , and they also are looking forward to eating authentic Taiwan cuisine and drinking genuine " pearl milk tea . "
Unfortunately , not only have the mainland authorities not responded enthusiastically to the little three links , they have even attacked the policy .
On December 28 , Zhou Mingtong , vice-director of the State Council 's Taiwan Affairs Office , stated at a banquet for Taiwan media that the little three links are " small potatoes . "
Li Yafei , secretary - general of the PRC 's Association for Relations Across the Strait , said that the mainland does n't even have the concept or term " little three links , " and that the key to the " three links " remains the " one China " principle .
Looking to future cross-strait interactions , the opening of the three links -LRB- at least for tourism and economic interactions -RRB- does not have to get bogged down in the debate over independence vs. reunification , and has in fact already become a new consensus between the two sides .
The success of the relevant government policies in conforming to public opinion and building healthy cross-strait relations , and the PRC 's willingness to tone down the rhetoric and make peace the top priority , will be decisive in creating a win - win situation and in reinvigorating the economy .

Though cross-strait relations remain frosty , this did not stop the Taiwan Poster Design Association from holding its 2001 Peace Poster Competition , with participants from both sides welcome .
