Al Waeli , peace , mercy , and the blessing of God be upon you .
As a courtesy , not an order , please place in the political forum this picture , which goes back to 1973 - 1393 , at the time of King Faisal , may God have mercy on him , when he prevented the export of oil to America .
The picture shows the extent of our ability to stand in the face of America , and I hope the members would comment on the picture .

Things today are more complicated than before ...
and the lurkers for us are many ...
Also , the world today has become uni-polar ... as they say !
I wish things would stay like that ... but leave it to God ...
God shall decide .

Question : I would like to ask His Highness Prince Saud whether the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is ready to raise its production of oil , in case the Iranian crisis causes a reduction of the Iranian production or a rise in prices ?
In other words , is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ready to use the oil weapon against the oil weapon ?
I would also like to ask with regard to the Iranian crisis , what is the significance of the initiatives that the group of nations , of which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is part , I mean , the Gulf Cooperation Council , are undertaking in order to develop the project of the nuclear program ?
Is this , I mean , the preparation a group of Sunni Arab countries are undertaking as a warning directed at the Iranian leadership ?
Your Highness , the Minister : We are -LSB- handling -RSB- the issue of facing the oil weapon with the oil weapon , because we do not consider it an oil weapon .
It is wealth to be used , and we are using this wealth in consideration of our national interests , the interests of the producing nations , and the interests of the consuming nations .
His Highness the Oil Minister has very clearly clarified that the policy of the Kingdom is established on balance in the oil market .
The Kingdom has historically proven that in times of crisis , it does what it should do as the biggest producer of oil , in a way that guarantees the stability of the oil markets .
As for the nuclear program which the Gulf Cooperation Council has approved , I believe that among the most important reasons on which the Council agreed in this framework is to enter in this important industry , the importance of which not only includes a military aspect , but also a peaceful aspect , in order to establish an industry subject to strict controls that can not be violated , in order to guarantee its peaceful direction .
And it may be an example for all who want to have this industry and have no intention of developing it , other than establishing nuclear weapons .
This is the goal the Gulf Cooperation Council countries are seeking .

No doubt the political reading today differs from the situations in which the decision was made at that time .
The political situation of the world today has even become more complicated than before .
It ca n't be said that any oil producing country can use oil as a weapon to impose a certain political vision or political position .
It may be one of the most important reasons that the American presence in the region today has become a fact with which we have to live , not to face with any weapon .

It is very hard today to use oil as a weapon .
We will suffer more than the Americans in my belief .
And God -LSB- knows better -RSB- .
