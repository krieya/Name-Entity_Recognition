Taiwan News Holds Seminar on Cross-Strait Relations
The biggest story of the year in Taiwan has naturally been the changing of the guard at the presidential palace as a result of the Democratic Progressive Party -LRB- DPP -RRB- victory in the election on 18 March .
Jin Zhong , president and editor - in - chief of Hong Kong 's OPEN magazine , which specializes in political reporting and commentary , spent an entire week in Taiwan observing the election campaign and its aftermath , and on 20 March , OPEN organized a seminar titled " The New President and Cross-Strait Relations . "
The seminar was held in cooperation with Taiwan News , one of the island 's oldest English - language newspapers -LRB- known until last year as the China News -RRB- .
The KMT ticket finished nearly 14 percentage points behind independent candidate James Soong and pulled in fully two million votes fewer than the DPP ticket , a margin of defeat which Jin Zhong described in his opening remarks as stunning .
When Chinese Communist premier Zhu Rongji made belligerent remarks a few days before the election in an effort to scare voters away from the DPP ticket , the ruling party made a grievous mistake , opined Jin , when it failed to come out strongly critical of Zhu and attempted instead to capitalize on the incident by playing the " fear card . "
At the same time , however , winning candidate Chen Shui - bian captured only 39 % of the vote , which translates to a weak mandate .
As a result , he must take a moderate line that stresses inter-party cooperation .
He will have to include a wide range of people in his government , keep a low profile , guard against any temptation to grow imperious in power , and strive to be a president of all the people .
As for mainland China 's saber - rattling , Jin argued that there is no need for undue concern .
Stated Jin , " The consequences would be too severe .
It 's not like Taiwan is without any means of retaliation .
Are the mainland authorities really prepared to see Hong Kong and Shanghai go up in flames ? "
There are other perspectives on cross-strait relations , of course .
The seminar participants basically fell into three camps on future prospects .
Some were highly optimistic , others were guardedly optimistic , and a third group argued that the crystal ball has gone cloudy .
Perhaps the most optimistic view was expressed by Ruan Ming , a visiting professor at Tamkang University 's Department of China Studies who in the 1980s was an assistant to former Chinese Communist Secretary General Hu Yaobang .
Ruan stated that Beijing 's basic position on Taiwan has not changed at all since the days of Deng Xiaoping .
" There 's nothing new in what they 're saying . "
The only thing the Chinese Communists are saying , says Ruan , is that they will attack " if Taiwan makes any sort of formal move toward independence , " and Taiwan has no need to formalize anything because changing the country 's name would be meaningless .
" No matter what you call yourself , people are still going to call you Taiwan .
It 's just like in England - the official name is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , but nobody calls it that .
And there 's no need to going around shouting , ' We 're a country ! We 're a country ! '
Who in the international community does that ? "
Pragmatism , please
" Taiwan needs to be more pragmatic , " says Ruan , " just like the mainland . "
They made a lot of noise ahead of the election trying to sway votes , but once the election was over they backpedaled quickly with the simple statement , " We 'll wait and see what they say and do . "
The attitude with them , in Ruan 's view , is very pragmatic .
Ruan is optimistic about cross-strait relations under the new regime , and states , " Chen Shui - bian is best positioned to improve cross-strait relations . "
He likens Chen to the staunchly anti-communist Richard Nixon , who was able to normalize ties with the Chinese Communists precisely because he was trusted by the American people .
Similarly , when Chen Shui - bian negotiates with Beijing , no one will worry about him selling Taiwan down the river .
The noted political commentator Chin Heng - wei , chief editor of Taiwan 's Contemporary Monthly , agreed strongly with Ruan 's comments , and added , " In this election the people of Taiwan were even more concerned about domestic issues than they were about cross-strait relations . "
The most pressing issues facing the new president are education , the environment , " black gold " politics -LRB- murky connections between the worlds of politics , business , and organized crime -RRB- , and crime fighting .
When Nobel laureate Lee Yuan - tseh came out in support of Chen Shui - bian , implying that the DPP represented " the progressive forces in society , " Chen 's support jumped immediately upward .
Virtually everyone at the seminar was in agreement that it is neither advisable nor necessary to seek a quick solution to the cross-strait issue , and that Taiwan need only avoid stirring up Chinese nationalism .
Wei Chengsi -LRB- news director at ATV news in Hong Kong and a former director of policy research in the public relations department of the municipal party committee in Shanghai -RRB- emphasized the fluid nature of Beijing 's policy on Taiwan .
He feels that the mainland authorities face many more pressing issues than Taiwan , and that the current tension basically stems from President Lee Teng - hui 's pronouncement on state - to - state relations .
Having been through the Tiananmen massacre , Wei felt compelled to warn the people of Taiwan , " You absolutely must not think the way the students did in Beijing in '89 .
You must not think that ' the communists wo n't attack because the US wo n't let them , ' and then go out of your way to provoke them to where they no longer have an out .
Under the wrong circumstances , failure to display strong Chinese nationalism could spell political suicide for a Communist Party leader , and he might well decide , ' To hell with the US and economic development , I 've got to attack if I 'm to stay in power . '
That would be an incredible disaster . "
Chiu Hsiang - chung , chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal , also advocated cautious optimism .
In his view , there has been no fundamental change in the cross-strait relationship , but he listed a few variables that bear close watching .
The first is the combination of nationalism and Jiang Zemin 's desire to serve another term as Secretary General of the Communist Party and make his mark on history .
Could he attempt to use nationalism to further his ambition ?
Second , the People 's Liberation Army hopes to parlay the Taiwan issue into increased influence in domestic politics .
Third , Taiwan could make mistakes and give the Chinese Communists an excuse for military action .
And a fourth factor is the wishy - washy American support for Taiwan .
If all of these variables combined in the wrong way , the military authorities could make a miscalculation that would lead to war .
When hawk meets hawk
Chou Chi - ping -LRB- senior advisor at Business Weekly -RRB- and Tseng Fu - sheng -LRB- general secretary of the KMT 's Department of Mainland Operations -RRB- felt that the future of cross-strait relations is still up in the air .
Chou , as a former official with the Straits Exchange Foundation , has had direct dealings with the Chinese Communists .
He argued that the DPP 's view of the mainland has always been colored by ideology , and thus take a dim view of the other side .
It is true , acknowledges Chou , that Chen Shui - bian has changed his basic stance and now says that he " will not change the country 's name , declare independence , or seek to enshrine the state - to - state principle in the constitution . "
It is also true that Lee Yuan - tseh -LRB- who is highly respected in the mainland for his academic achievements -RRB- has vouched for the sensibility of Chen 's approach to cross-strait relations .
And yes , once again , it is true that the Chinese Communists have muted their rhetoric considerably .
Nevertheless , the two sides view each other with suspicion .
If the Chinese Communists conclude that Taiwan 's leadership has dropped its insistence on formal independence only to pursue a policy that includes de facto independence as its aim , Chou argued that this will introduce a note of uncertainty into the relationship .
Tseng Fu - sheng feels that Taiwan should claim the high ground by holding up its experience in democratization as an example for the Chinese Communists .
Says Tseng , " Reunification depends entirely on whether China can democratize . "
His biggest worry is that the deep gulf between the DPP and the mainland authorities could cause them to misread each other .
He stressed that there are both doves and hawks on all sides of the trilateral relationship between Beijing , Washington , and Taipei .
If the hawks gained the upper hand at the same time in all three capitals , opined Tseng , the result could be war .
The seminar attendants also examined Taiwan 's domestic situation .
Versatile author and cultural commentator Ping Lu offered some very incisive comments regarding the post-election protests outside the KMT headquarters .
In demanding that Lee Teng - hui resign as chairman of the KMT to take responsibility for the election defeat , Ping -LRB- herself a second - generation " mainlander " -RRB- argued that the protest revealed an ethnic fault line in Taiwanese society .
It was a venting of mass frustration on the part of one particular ethnic group , said Ping , noting that most of the protesters were mainlanders .
This group feels a loss of status , for during the many decades of KMT rule they have always thought of themselves as a privileged " majority " in Taiwan even though in fact they are a minority .
They do not identify with Taiwan as their home , and they have an unconscious feeling of superiority vis - a - vis the local majority .
In some ways the election has forced them to realize that they truly are a minority .
This development should help to bring about long - lasting ethnic harmony in Taiwan .
The participants generally felt that the election was a victory for democracy .
On the domestic front , the victory of Chen Shui - bian showed that people want more democracy , greater respect for human rights , and a more serious effort to banish " black gold " from the political arena .
In cross-strait relations Chen 's victory spells the end of an era in which the cross-strait relationship was conducted within the framework of a civil war between he KMT and the Chinese Communist Party .
Reform of the KMT and the formation of a new political party by James Soong will also improve the political system in Taiwan .
It appears that the people of Taiwan have finally taken their first bold step into an era of true democracy , and a mature political system is no longer a distant prospect .
