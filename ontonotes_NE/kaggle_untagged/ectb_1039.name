Turning to the Constitution on the " One China " Issue
Still wrestling with the vexed issue of " one China , " the President 's Advisory Group on Cross-Strait Relations met for its sixth and seventh sessions during November , amid frenzied media attention .
The group eventually reached a consensus that the " one China " principle advocated by the mainland should be addressed " in accordance with the constitution . "
How president Chen Shui - bian responds to this proposal will determine whether or not the " one China " stalemate can be broken , and if there is to be a set timetable for implementing the three direct links .
After assuming the presidency , Chen Shui - bian recruited a number of leading politicians , industrialists , academics and other personages for a non-partisan advisory group , intended to build cross-party consensus on the subject of relations with the mainland .
Chaired by Academia Sinica president Lee Yuan - tseh , the Presidential Advisory Group on Cross-Strait Relations first met in early September .
Since then the Group has held a series of intensive discussions on Taiwan 's fundamental position regarding the cross-strait relationship .
The Group entered the final phase of discussions on the " one China " issue during November , but differences between pro-unification and pro-independence participants continued to stymie the effort to produce a statement acceptable to all .
As DPP legislator Shen Fu - hsiung pointed out , the Group had to draft something " palatable both to the pro-unification and pro-independence camps ; something which the DPP ca n't shun and yet which does n't make Beijing wince . "
Clearly no easy task .
On the evening of November 18 Advisory Group chairman Lee Yuan - tseh , meeting over dinner with DPP faction leaders , described the cross-strait situation as extremely precarious , and said that since time is not on Taiwan 's side we need to step up efforts to resume dialogue with the mainland .
Separately , during his report to the Legislative Yuan on the Academia Sinica 's budget , Lee reiterated : " If the whole population could arrive at a consensus on ' one China , ' then President Chen would have no grounds for not accepting that consensus . "
Lee added that he hoped the Advisory Group would shortly come to a firm conclusion on the " one China " issue .
Lee Yuan - tseh 's appeal made little impression on the governing DPP , however .
Furthermore , DPP chairman Frank Hsieh himself came under fire within the party after stating : " The constitution of the ROC is itself a one China framework .
Since the DPP has participated in the process of constitutional amendment it ought to accept this constitution , and as the party of government we ca n't afford to override or reject it . "
According to DPP lawmaker Lin Cho - shui , Chen Shui - bian has shown more goodwill to Beijing as president than Lee Teng - hui ever did , but without any response -
so why should he once again be expected to respond on the " one China " issue ?
Also , Lin disagrees with Lee Yuan - tseh 's assertion that " time is not on our side , " and instead feels that things are no worse than before .
Meanwhile , the opposition alliance has been calling for the DPP to " shed its ideological baggage . "
On November 24 the New Party , which had already pulled out of the Advisory Group , published an article in the press signed by leading members such as Yu Mu - ming and Chen Kui - miao , in which they called on the government to take the constitution as its starting point for breaking the " one China " deadlock .
They pointed out that Chen and the DPP had competed in elections in accordance with the constitution , winning the presidency and a share of seats in the legislature and the National Assembly , and had also participated in the process of revising the constitution .
Now , with its constitutionally granted mandate , the party has an obligation to fully uphold the constitution .
As the politicians argued , Formosa Plastics boss Wang Yung - ching convened a meeting with other captains of industry to come up with some advice for the government on economic policy .
For the first time Wang voiced support for Lee Yuan - tseh 's proposal that " with ' one China ' as the precondition , each side can have its own interpretation . "
Wang also agreed with Lee 's notion that time is running out for Taiwan , in the belief that Taiwan will only have time on its side once it starts to carry out well - intentioned engagement with the mainland .
Consensus on the " one China question " is an urgent priority for both sides if there is to be a peaceful future .
Wang Yung - ching 's demand for a review of the government 's " go slow " policy , and opening of the three direct links , brought a personal phone call from the president , who invited him to come and discuss policy .
On November 25 Wang and a handful of other leading industrialists went to call on the president at his official residence .
The businessmen said that shelving the " one China " issue was not the right thing for the government to do , and that Taiwan could no longer afford to play word games .
They stressed the need for early restoration of the mechanism for cross-strait economic dialogue , and said that the government should also think about moving towards political dialogue .
The Presidential Advisory Group met again on November 26 , and discussed a proposal , made earlier by Public Television System chairman Wu Feng - shan and already favored by most members of the Group , for " one China " to be addressed through " three acknowledgements and four suggestions . "
A firm consensus was finally arrived at , and the Group submitted to the president its proposal that Taiwan should " respond to the mainland 's ' one China ' proposition in accordance with the constitution of the ROC . "
The government and opposition parties continued to disagree regarding this consensus .
DPP legislator Lin Cho - shui described it as " acceptable , if not very satisfactory . "
PFP spokesman Li Ching - an called it " a conclusion without a conclusion . "
New Party convenor Hau Lung - pin said the statement was too ambiguous , tending towards " one China , with each side free to make its own interpretation , " and added that it was highly unlikely to be used by the president as a guide for cross-strait policy .
Ting Shou - chung , deputy executive director of the KMT policy committee , said this so - called consensus was simply a case of going round and round on the spot , and would do nothing to solve the core problem .
In a November 28 press release , the Mainland Affairs Council -LRB- MAC -RRB- , the government body in charge of cross-strait affairs , diplomatically stated that it would observe and implement the suggestions of the Advisory Group if and when they become official government policy .
Speaking on the topic of the three direct links , MAC chairwoman Tsai Ing - wen said that these will be phased in according to conditions , with the first phase being the opening of direct business links as necessitated by the admission of both sides to the WTO .
And according to economics minister Lin Hsin - yi , the government recognizes that the " go slow " policy needs to be relaxed , and will give a more thorough accounting of this before the end of the year .
