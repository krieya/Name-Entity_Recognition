Meanwhile , the director of the FBI , Louis Freeh , is headed for Yemen to personally supervise the investigation into the attack on the `` USS Cole , '' and some progress is being made .
NBC 's Jim Miklaszewski is at the Pentagon tonight , with the latest for us now .
Tom , investigators tonight are still trying to figure out exactly what kind of explosive could cause such devastating damage to the `` Cole . ''
They 're focusing on an abandoned apartment where bomb - making materials were found , but today , the Yemen President claims that the explosive found could only come from the U.S. or Israel , implying that the materials or the weapon itself were Western - made .
U.S. military and intelligence officials can not confirm his claim .
Authorities also discovered two Yemen passports , but quickly determined they were fakes , not surprising to one U.S. official , who said everything in Yemen 's terrorist underground is a forgery .
Tom ?
Thanks very much , NBC 's Jim Miklaszewski at the Pentagon tonight .
