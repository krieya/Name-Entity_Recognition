he did n't command the legs , %huh ?
mhm
sometimes not as much as he would like to be ,
but he 's doing really good .
and he 's Now I think that he 's got kind of control
uh-huh
he 's much sweeter
uh-huh
188.81_192.55_B: yeah ,
he seems to be have a ,
well I mean he was sweet before ,
but
well , it 's a frustrating process to be always falling down , %huh ?
yeah ,
and now he 's usually better ,
now he 's pretty fussy
but oi
yeah
so , how have you been ?
work and Elizabeth ?
and
yeah ,
that was a hard trip
%uh , she 's not at all well , matter of fact
I would n't be surprised to get a phone call anytime .
oh , really ?
yeah ,
she was wanting to die while we were there .
really .
yeah ,
she 's had her fourth stroke
and oh gosh . there 's a lot of pain on her left side ,
and she ca n't walk without a walker ,
and she ca n't go but a few steps ,
and %mm so she lives on the in a chair and on couch and back in her hospital bed , right there within a few feet of each other .
%mm
and a she 's so used to being , you know up and busy , and in control , and able to do and
and she ca n't ?
no .
so she 's finishing her autobiography and then %uh wanting to die , but not , not lifting off ,
so she 's pretty angry and irritable .
wondering what 's the hold up .
yeah .
but her mother died %ah , f- , four years after having a stroke ,
so
oh yeah ?
yeah ,
so she 's not , not supposed to die yet , evidently .
yeah ,
it 's not time
well , that 's a rough trip ,
but
yeah ,
but Laura was able to help her with the book a bit , you know by her sort of secretly wanting her to read it . and tell what sections are where
and and I was packing up things for her to send to people , ,
she wants to ,
you know , things for her family and things
oh yeah
it was kind of a hard and sad trip , in that way ,
but we went %ah , she sent us off to Sonoma one day ,
we went up to Sonoma
and that 's nice
uh-huh
we just aw we were so wretched hot , we just sort of stayed in the car and drove .
Drove off to the sights , you know ?
yeah ,
I ca n't imagine how hot it would be .
yeah .
but still I looked on the ,
least last night still did n't ,
a hundred down there
uh-huh
so it 's been %ah ninety or a hundred for a month now down there jeez down there .
and it 's been , today and yesterday was the first day in a long time that we 've had it less than a hundred , or ninety
and so it 's in the eighties
and it feel marvelous .
wow
and so we finally get some relief from the weather .
it 's like autumn here .
I mean , 342.14_342.66_A: is that right ? yeah , it 's about fifty , fifty five .
yeah ,
that 's right ,
you 're all ready ,
you 've got a short summer , %huh ,
so it 's all ready yeah moving into it ,
yeah
yeah ,
and it smells and it feels like autumn .
is that right ?
, yeah ,
it has for about a week or so .
getting a little , getting a little crisp %huh ?
mhm .
yeah ,
shorts weather is definitely gone ,
I do n't know if it ever really came .
I was waiting
Wait a second ,
what 's going on ?
well I 'm a Finnish T V star .
374.10_374.55_A: are you ?
yeah ,
you were on T V ?
well , I 'm going to be .
oh you are
I did the filming on , last Thursday .
Alexia are you okay ?
and , %um , it 's kind of a cultural show , %um
uh-huh , inter -- to -- view the Americans ?
yeah ,
and we do like little skits on like how %um , Americans react to things differently than other cultures , and oh , neat Finnish culture ,
so we like do the subway scene of Americans in the subway , and Finns in the subway .
they 're pretty funny
I 'll bet that was fun , %huh ?
yeah ,
I think it 'll be pretty interesting
it does n't %um air starting until January fifteenth ,
but it 's pretty fun I think , because they had French , and German , and Asian , and
I 'll be interested to see how they put it all together .
yeah
%um , yeah ,
see how it ends up ,
so
, so will will it be in Finnish ,
or
no .
well we spoke in English ,
but it 's like a Finnish documentary .
it 's a Finnish documentary
but it has all these sections to it ?
yeah
yeah ,
neat
yeah ,
like different parts of movies and stuff ,
so we 're , I 'm going to see if I can get my American friend to tape it .
neat .
Yammi and I are saving up for one of those V C R's that have the mode ,
so maybe by then we 'll have one ,
we can tape it
and yes it seems interesting what they 're doing ,
so
yeah ,
so it 'll be a cross culture center %huh ?
yeah ,
and they 're paying me
so , it 's like
is that right ?
yeah ,
I thought it 's pretty nice
yeah
pays to be a foreigner sometimes , I guess
, not all the time , but sometimes
yeah ,
right
so that 's what we 've been doing here ,
just kind of Yammi 's been taking a few days off while I go and
oh so it was a , not just a little thing then , %huh
well , it was just a couple times
just went a couple times
and oh . uh-huh then if they want to use me later or something they 'll call
oh neat
yeah ,
but it 's pretty fun
neither of us could act .
well , was it like a Helsinki station or ?
, no it 's a Finnish station .
oh
on T V one
and
%hm
so it 's just for the
Alexi honey , come here sweetie
he got , he got the door shut ,
and he 's kind of cranky now
do you want to get him ?
yeah ,
hold on , just a second .
okay I forgot it 's free ,
so you do n't have to
, that 's right
we were worried so much mhm about it ,
but
you wou- you would 've love this house we saw honey .
oh yeah
it was unbelievable
Frank Lloyd Wright 's %huh ?
yeah
aw
it , it would be nice to live in now , you know
yeah ?
and it was built in nineteen oh two
and it 's probably modern looking als- yeah as it would seem to me
yeah ,
yeah ,
it was just gorgeous
aw
and that glass , in extraordinary art glass throughout , in the
the %ah , chandeliers in the dining room were butterfly design
and , oh wow there were butterfly designs in the door coming in
and just , just gorgeous
wow
built for sixty thousand dollars really back in nineteen oh two
yeah ,
a while back I think .
wow .
it would have been nice to see .
I I really enjoy that calendar yeah you guys sent , the Frank Lloyd Wright calendar yeah looking at it ,
I like it .
a lot of people have made comments about who 's this , you know , who did this ?
%hm
coolest
Frank Lloyd Wright
but , yeah ,
I looked into a masters' program here yeah in ,
and they cost seventy thousand marks a year
%huh
so that 's like what ?
twenty four thousand or something ?
you 're kidding .
no .
I thought , whoa .
that 's pretty steep considering all the other education 's free here ,
yeah .
yeah ,
so what 's what 's the deal ?
well , it 's especially for --
private school
well no ,
but it , they , do n't have masters program
does kind of ,
it 's new , starting out this year
and it 's %um designed to fit the States ' idea of undergrad and masters program , you know
%uh
so , I 'm going to see about trying to just get into the regular school , and trying to continue like maybe next year or something ,
but
yeah .
so being a Finnish citizen , or being married to a Finnish citizen does n't help you in that way ,
that
well not for that masters program it does n't
but for just going , if I wanted just to take classes to receive a Finnish degree , which is equivalent to a masters
Alexi come here
hold on dad ,
I 'm sorry .
okay
okay ,
sorry
hey , mister Alexi
nap time
he 's getting kind of cranky ,
I 'll let him bang on the key board a little bit ,
but I 'm going to take a Finnish course and see how that goes
well that 's probably the next step anyway , is n't it ?
yeah
get good at your Finnish , %huh
for me ,
mhm
and I 'm
so it 'll be nice ,
get started and see how that goes then ,
%um , I tried to send you guys cards , couple weeks ago , and realized that I did n't have your address
oh , you want to write it down ?
yeah .

fifty one fifty eight Hawthorn Drive
