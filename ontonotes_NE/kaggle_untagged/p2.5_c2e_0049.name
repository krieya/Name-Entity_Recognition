Last week I called a friend who 's recently become a surgeon in Beijing , and heard something that I 'll say a bit about .
Basically , most people 's idea of an operation is nothing but that you give the patient an anesthetic , ah , cut him open , take out the bad bits , sew him up , and it 's over .
That 's when you meet obliging people .
But there are some people in this world who are just not that obliging .
My friend had the luck to meet some of these people .
A forty - something middle - aged man was going to have an operation .
It was n't a minor operation ; it would need at least two or three hours , and need a general anesthetic .
He was given the anesthetic , and , hey , he 's still wide awake , chatting with the doctor , on and on and on .
What about ?
Just those couple of last night 's World Cup games were such and so forth .
It happened that one of the doctors was a soccer fan , too , and the two of them just began chatting on the operating table .
But no one can stand you talking like this !
This thing takes two or three hours , and if I make a wrong cut with my knife here , are you going to be giving me an end - of - year bonus ?
And the nurse is n't happy , either , -- not everyone is a sports fan -- and just by coincidence she has just had a fight with her other half last night because of the TV matter .
The doctors and nurses knew the bottom of the story quite well , so they stopped right away after they saw her face .
