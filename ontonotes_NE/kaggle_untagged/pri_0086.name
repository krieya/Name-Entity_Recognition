In Yugoslavia today , a Belgrade court indited six members of electoral commissions on charges that they abused their official functions .
Last September , Yugoslavia 's Federal Election Commission published results of a presidential vote , results which , if anyone had believed them , would have necessitated a run off between Slobodan Milosevic and Vojislav Kostunica .
There was no run off , of course , Serbs would n't stand for it .
Now three months later Kostunica is no longer opposing the government .
He is running it .
The World 's Jackie Rolan reports from Belgrade .
The popular uprising which swept Vojislav Kostunica to power , hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in early October to force Slobodan Milosevic to accept his election defeat and step down .
In the two months since then the United Nations and Western governments have rushed to welcome Yugoslavia back into the international fold , but at home the most noticeable change has been a sharp increase in the cost of living .
President Kostunica says this is inevitable but he sees better times ahead .
We are living all under very difficult conditions .
Social aspirations is very difficult and that is something which has to do with Milosevic regime , sanctions of international community , bombing of this country last year , but what people mostly appreciate is that sense of freedom .
The West has been rewarding the democratic reforms in Serbia with big aid packages , but the money comes with some conditions attached .
Western governments want Serbia to cooperate with the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague .
The Tribunal has been allowed to open an office in Belgrade , but it 's not clear how far this cooperation will go .
President Kostunica says he does not agree with demands that Milosevic should be extradited to The Hague .
I am not in favor of that I must say .
I am in favor of trying to go through these processes of responsibility within the country .
I have a very general and many very general objections to the Hague Tribunal .
I can not imagine that just one judicial instant , just one court is actually enough to cope this problems .
After winning the presidency in September , Kostunica and his allies now face a much easier task with Serbian parliamentary elections in less then two weeks time .
The latest opinion polls suggest they will get about 65 % of the vote , while Milosevic and his party would be lucky to win more then a few seats .
The opposition coalition has been an alliance of convenience and President Kostunica admits that it will not last long beyond the elections .
We had to run through these republic elections and with all these differences we are staying till these elections , and later on when we come to some elections , of course , quite normally and for the good of democracy , these differences between the parties within Democratic Opposition of Serbia will appear .
The splits are already visible with public disagreements between Kostunica and Zoran Djindjic , the man expected to form the new Serbian government , so the country faces more political instability in the year ahead and the likely prospect of new elections .
For The World , I am Jacky Rowland in Belgrade .
