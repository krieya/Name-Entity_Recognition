Yugoslavians are waking up today to a new political landscape .
Vojislav Kostunica Saturday was sworn in as the country 's new President yesterday .
He took the oath of office before parliament .
In his acceptance speech , he said democracy is now realized in Yugoslavia , and he encouraged members of parliament to put their differences aside .
We can work together , in spite of our political differences , here in this federal parliament .
I think the consequences of what has happened will be obvious after a while , but we are a little bit surprised right now , and even now I sometimes think it looks like a dream , but it is a reality , and it is good .
Thursday , tens of thousands of people stormed parliament , demanding former President Slobodan Milosevic admit defeat in September 's presidential election and leave office .
He agreed to do so a day later but is vowing to remain active in politics .
