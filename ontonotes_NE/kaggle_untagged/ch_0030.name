Unbelievable .
yeah

%eh %eh thank God
really very very happy .
Very nice .
great
What 's what 's what 's with you ?
%uh , let 's see ,
well I 'm han- still hanging out at Westinghouse .
yeah .
I have your hat .
I wear your hat all the time .
oh goo-
I thought you you know it 's a good hat man .
I I sent that to you with all %uh good intents .
I hope you appreciate it .
I do .
I wear it all the time .
okay .
I even have a p- %uh %uh I I hope I have %um a picture of myself when I %uh had reserves the other day . you know th- th- the other month .
uh-huh .
I took a picture %uh with me
and I had hope it comes out .
I 'll send it to you .
Thank you very much .
%um
If it does n't I 'll take another picture .
Let 's see %uh
Go ahead .
Well I 'm still working there you know
and %uh I got a I 'm on a pretty good project .
Right .
A long a long term %uh next generation %uh fighter plane .
Really ?
So that 's %uh kind of good experience I guess .
uh-huh .
And %uh Westinghouse supposedly is making a bid to buy the %uh C B S broadcasting network .
I thought they bought them already .
Well , you know , th- it 's takes months to close a deal
so there 's lots of spec- -- %ah . -- lots of speculation -- Right . -- that they 'll have to sell the %uh electronics division in order to do that .
And wh- wh- and what would happen with you ?
I guess we 'd be sold to another company and see what happens .
I do n't know .
mhm .
I 'm not too concerned about it though
but it 's a possibility .
But Have you %uh have you y- have a senior position there .
Well , I suppose so .
But , you know . They do n't really think of it that way
they look they just look at the numbers how many people they want and how many people they have .
It 's just a business .
Right .
they just get rid of what they do n't want .
uh-huh .
But %uh that 's that 's still going pretty well .
%huh
nothing really new with the h- house or anything
We 've had some interesting incidents with wasps that have %uh been invading the neighborhood .
They started they they built a nest in my rafters of my house and busted through .
But I told you about that , I think .
I got a in the in the mail .
yeah .
So that
Well I wanted to ask you wha- what 's what 's with the school ?
The schools are extremely expensive .
I 'm going broke basically doing that .
And I do n't know how to %uh handle that .
But how come th- how come how come they do n't help you ?
It does n't make a difference .
They 're only going to you 're still going to go broke whether they help you or not .
They 're not going to let you run a p- run a run a profit when you 're on scholarship .
If you if you have t- two thousand dollars at the end of the year they 're not going to say oh well %uh I guess you can have that .
They 're going to make you pay everything .
Wait a minute
I 'm talking about
wait
wait fir-
I 'm talking about yo- your schooling .
My schooling ?
I thought you meant the kids ' school .
My schooling ?
yeah .
I do n't know .
I put it on hold all the time .
took a course last semester
I I have n't signed up yet for the fall
It 's a lot of stress .
It 's a lot of stress .
Taking to trying to
you know you put out a lot of money
and you have to work really hard to get it back .
Right .
And there 's not necessarily any benefit to it either .
So
%hm .
I was talking abou- I was sorry I was talking about the kids ' school .
Right
the ki- the kids . yeah
R J told me how much -- yeah . -- it costs .
But meanwhile -- It 's a lot of money . -- she does n't know how much you pay .
I do n't know why that is .
I think what we pay
%um %mm we have to %uh
books for all the k- all the kids cost us %uh for for for for two kids it cost about a six hundred sh- about two hundred dollars apiece .
uh-huh ?
And then for %um the taxes and everything else abo- maybe if it i- c- if i- if it costs %uh a year %um maybe %uh seven hundred dollars a a a kid .
okay .
That 's total everything .
Pretty much .
yeah .
Pretty much .
So we 're paying about eight times that .
No about four about five times that .
yeah
five times that
No , actually , %ah we 're paying six times that .
I 'm paying four thousand two hundred dollars a kid . %uh Or more .
Right .
Right .
But then you could also loo- loo- look into the other part . The the tax bracket
yeah .
Here f- here f- %uh
yeah
forty - five
forty - five , actually with all the other taxes that are going on here
the first job %uh i- i- I pay forty - five percent -- mhm . -- my salary .
It goes to taxes .
And then with my a- all the mo- all all of my second job , it already comes out to fifty - five percent of that .
%mm %mm %mm .
Plus the taxes .
Unbelievable .
That 's incredible .
That 's why I I got the I remember I got th- the first paycheck
yeah
I pretty much knew that 's what the statistics were .
Right .
As soon as you you get yo- y- you get you get the paycheck and you see the before tax income and you say wow fi- like f- finally you 're able to get up to a decent number and then you look at th- th- the bottom
and and you say what is this .
You put it into your y- your little pocket calculator --
-- you say they 're taking f- taking fifty - five percent
says fifty - five percent .
I say what country -- -- in their right mind takes fif-
what about the encouragement %eh trying to encourage the populace to go to work and to save more , to earn more .
They %uh they do n't care .
But you still like it there ?
Fifty - five

You 're still
