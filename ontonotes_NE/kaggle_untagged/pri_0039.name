With this month 's ouster of strongman Slobodan Milosevic , Yugoslavia is rapidly joining the international community .
Today , the country was admitted into an international Balkan development program .
Belgrade now hopes to join the United Nations , the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank .
At home , President Vojislav Kostunica says that he intends to promote democracy and free speech , but Kostunica just might have second thoughts , once a theater group that roasted his predecessor over the coals starts turning him on a spit .
The World 's Nened Chebeck reports from the Yugoslav capital .
These days at almost every street corner in central Belgrade , there is a stall selling compact discs with protest songs against the former regime , and the most popular tune blaring out of the speakers goes like this , `` attention , attention , last train for Serbia via day stop Kosovo and The Hague is departing with a ten hour delay .
It 's the latest hit by the satirical theater called `` Index '' .
They started off 20 years ago in a local radio station and became an enormous success on stage and not just here in Serbia .
They toured the world and performed wherever there is an emigrant community from the former Yugoslavia scattered by the wars here , from Australia to New York where Index will be returning in late November .
This song is from their latest play , The Last Train for Serbia , which was recorded on the day protestors stormed the federal parliament in Belgrade and the main television stations .
The song speaks of panic in the household of Slobodan Milosevic .
Even before the former President conceded defeat , the Index Theater performed live on an improvised stage outside the parliament , in front of a crowd of some 300,000 people .
Actor Drugewbo Unitich tells how the show began .
The first thing that I told them was please let us close our eyes and just listen .
When they did that and I saw them and I told them in a voice of Milosevic , `` Ladies and gentleman , I am definitely finished . ''
Only 3 or 4 hours after that he appeared on television and said something very similar to that .
Yubitrich is one of Belgrade 's most popular actors and he owes it to his skilful portrayal of Slobodan Milosevic .
Getting into Milosevic 's shoes even on stage , was quite a temptation says Yubitrich .
I always felt when I enter his person , Okay , that I can do whatever I want and I always molested our fellow players you know .
So being Milosevic is something which I can compare to taking a dangerous drug .
But with Milosevic out of the way , what next for Serbia 's most popular satirical group ?
Writer Vojislav Jonetic says he is confident the new Yugoslav government will provide plenty of fresh material .
We will have plenty of politicians , which we can play .
We will have plenty of idiotic situations in Serbian politics .
Political satirical theater is something which you can apply best to the societies , which are in some kind of crisis .
We are still in crisis and we will be I think for a while , but the current crisis Jonetic hopes will at least be one where government critics will not be branded as traitors and be banned from public performances .
Index Theater is planning a huge comeback now with a series of shows in Belgrade , but even though Milosevic is under de facto house arrest in Belgrade , he is very much present on the repertoire of political humors , says his impersonator , Dragewbo Yubitrich .
I would like to share one joke with the listeners of The World .
It 's the year of 2004 .
In Serbia it is 57th round of elections from September 2000 and Slobodan Milosevic appears on national tv and says , `` I want to greet you as your new President , my name is Vojislav Kostunica '' .
Yubitrich says , he has already set his sights on the new Yugoslav President , Kostunica and will most likely be impersonating him in the future .
He is not as easy to make fun of yet Yubitritch says , unlike Milosevic , but that does n't mean he will escape the scrutiny and sharp wits of Index Theater .
For The World , this is Nenad Chebeck in Belgrade .
