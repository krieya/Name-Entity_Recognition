Family members and close allies of former President Slobodan Milosevic are leaving Yugoslavia ahead of possible investigations into their financial dealings .
Some are believed to have millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts .
Stefan Boss reports from Belgrade .
As Serbia is preparing to inaugurate a new government , some members of former President Slobodan Milosevic 's family are leaving the country .
The son of Milosevic , Marco , tried unsuccessfully to flee to China , but he was refused entry and was on his way back to Moscow from where he came .
Earlier Marco Milosevic did not receive a visa in Russia , a situation which could only be cleared after his uncle and diplomats intervened .
It was seen as another sign that both Russia and China have abandoned their friendship with the Milosevic family and that they are seeking closer ties with new President Vojislav Kostunica .
