They say a rising tide lifts all boats .
No one would know more about that than the older generation in Taiwan .
The changes of the past five decades have had a deep impact , for example , on the Wu family of Yunlin County .
Their main claim to fame is ... nothing , actually , and that is precisely why their story typifies the experiences of so many .
So lend your attention , dear reader , as we recount the ups and downs of an average family from a quiet little backwater called Taihsi Township .
Wu Tsung - sheng and his older sister have come to meet me at the train station in Touliu , administrative seat of Yunlin County .
We pile into a car and head toward their parents ' home .
Wu Tsung - sheng fills me in on his hometown .
" Taihsi is a rather unusual place , " says Tsung - sheng , the family 's oldest grandson and a doctoral candidate in sociology at Tunghai University in Taichung .
" When I read the studies that describe Taiwan as being so prosperous , I have to wonder how their descriptions could be so totally different from what our lives have been .
They might as well be talking about a different planet . "
Probably most people do n't realize , adds Tsung - sheng , that there are still places in Taiwan as backward as Taihsi .
To the outsider , however , the place does n't look backward at all .
As Tsung - sheng drives west in a very nice Toyota at a comfortable speed down a broad county highway , his older sister sits in the front passenger seat with cell phone in hand discussing the traffic situation with someone at home .
In the meantime , Tsung - sheng 's five - year - old nephew clamors from the back seat for his mother to buy him a Pokemon plaything , just like kids the world over are doing these days .
When McDonald 's stores in Taiwan were swamped last year during a giveaway of Hello Kitty dolls , lots of people thought they might be able to beat the crowds by hitting McDonald 's in supposedly untrendy Taihsi , but they found the lines there every bit as long as in more urban locations .
The emperor is far away
The scenery grows increasingly rural as we move west through the townships of Huwei , Tuku , Paochung , and Tungshih .
Temples tower over green rice fields .
Less than half an hour after leaving the train station we get off the county highway and onto narrow Tungshih East Road .
When we reach our destination in rural Taihsi Township , a few dozen buildings of modern ferroconcrete construction line the road , and shops of every description occupy the ground floor of each one .
Wu Tsung - sheng 's parents , who are pushing 60 years old , run a local bakery , and they greet us with the wide smiles and warm hospitality so typical of haikou -LRB- as the locals are accustomed to calling Taihsi and the surrounding townships near the coast in western Yunlin County -RRB- .
They also speak Taiwanese with an unmistakable haikou accent .
To welcome their guest they have ordered a big seafood meal in advance .
Tsung - sheng 's grandmother , parents , uncles , aunts , cousins , nephews , and nieces have all come in from around haikou for the gathering .
The strength of the Wu clan 's family ties is plainly evident .
These people go back for generations here .
From the destruction of World War II to the mixed joy and grief of the early post-war years , from the barest of rural hamlets to a prosperous little town , this family has seen it all .
84 - year - old grandma Wu is not as sharp as she used to be , but she can still rattle off a tale or two .
Two indignities suffered back in the 1940s , in particular , remain indelibly etched in her memory .
The first occurred in the latter part of World War II when the Japanese tied her hands behind her back and marched her off to do forced labor for over a year , building roads , digging ditches , and carrying a shoulder pole .
The second indignity was the onerous taxes that were levied in the early years after Taiwan returned to Chinese rule .
" We had to pay taxes twice a year , " says grandma Wu , flashing a mouthful of dental work .
" The first time was for water , and the second was for land .
It did n't matter whether you even had a crop to harvest or not - you had to pay , or they 'd throw you in jail . "
She explains that one dou -LRB- 10 liters -RRB- of rice back in the 1940s was worth five or six yuan , or about four days ' pay for a manual laborer , but the tax on one jia of land -LRB- 0.97 hectares -RRB- was 150 yuan .
A lot of people had to borrow money just to pay their taxes .
" It took four days to earn one dou of rice , " says grandma Wu .
" We could n't afford to eat it , because we needed it to pay our taxes . "
Although the Kuomintang government eventually carried out land reform to provide relief for poor farmers , the Wu family never shared in the benefits .
They were as poor as their neighbors , to be sure , but they owned land and were thus classified as small landowners , which by definition meant that they neither had any extra land to rent out nor did they rent from others .
While many of their neighbors received land as a result of the reforms , the Wu family got nothing .
Grandma Wu was close to 30 years old when the Kuomintang recovered Taiwan from Japan , but the event meant little to her , for she had never received any schooling .
All she remembers is that when the war ended , Taiwan was turned over to " them . "
With a grin , grandma Wu throws up her hands in a gesture of helplessness and quips , " When the colonial government spoke , I did n't understand their Japanese .
When the Kuomintang speaks , I do n't understand their Mandarin either . "
" There 's no difference between the Japanese government and the Kuomintang , " says Grandma Wu .
" If something important comes up , they send a local official out to make an announcement and explain what it 's all about . "
Wu Tsung - sheng adds , " They 're totally outside the loop here .
You of course know the phrase , ' Heaven is high and the emperor is far away . '
Well , it was people like my grandmother who coined it . "
Grandma Wu was adopted into the Wu family at age ten .
Within half a year both of her adoptive parents died , and at age 11 she slipped and fell in the sugar cane fields , poking her left eye out .
Orphaned and blind in one eye , a hard life lay in store for her , but she made the best of a bad situation .
With no male siblings to carry on the family line , at age 25 she managed to find a husband who was willing to let his first male child take the Wu surname .
The children came rapidly , and there was never any money to spare .
But it is clear that she does live reasonably well now .
When did survival cease to be such a struggle ?
Grandma Wu remembers quite clearly when the turning point came .
It was in the early 1980s , when her oldest grandchild was already a teenager , that business gradually started going better for her three sons .
The three brothers got together and decided that they should each give her NT$ 2,000 every month .
For the first time in her life , she was able to relax a bit , then five years ago the government started providing a monthly pension of NT$ 3,000 .
This was enough to cover meals , and her life improved even more .
Grandma Wu now lives together with several other old folks very near the coast in the old traditional farmhouse where she grew up .
Her main worry these days is her granddaughter in Taipei , who is in her 30s and still unmarried .
" Her father got married when he was 22 .
How can a girl be putting things off ? "
13 - year - old construction worker
A lot of hard work has gone into the comfortable life Grandma Wu enjoys today .
Her eldest son Wu Chien - lo recounts that after he graduated from sixth grade in 1954 his family was too poor to let him go any further in school , so at age 13 he took off with an older boy on the slow train for Taipei .
Without pausing to take in the sights of the big city , Chien - lo went straight to work at a construction site , where he carried a shoulder pole and mixed cement .
Buildings were going up everywhere in Taipei in the mid-1950s , and the city was bursting with opportunities .
But , says Chien - lo , " I only had a grade - school education .
I did n't have what it took to think about a career in Taipei .
I just wanted to go back and help my family work the fields . "
After two years in Taipei he went back home just as the area was getting electric power for the first time .
The bright lights at night got some people so excited at first that they could n't get to sleep .
Taiwan back then was one of the world s biggest producers of sugar cane , but the harvest was extremely difficult work , as Chien - lo is painfully aware .
Once he came very close to cutting a finger clean off with a sickle , but he just slapped some cement mix -LRB- commonly regarded as a good disinfectant -RRB- on the wound and worked on through the pain .
United we stand
Wu Chien - lo joined the army at age 20 , and during his stint he made friends with someone who had been making a living as a baker .
Chien - lo began to realize that selling his manual labor was not a viable long - term option .
He decided to open a bakery .
After receiving his discharge he borrowed NT$ 12,000 from his father , hired a baker , and opened up a store .
He himself rode around on a motorcycle all day selling beverages and baked goods .
His capital ran out before he expected , and he had to ask for a second loan from his father - in - law to get his business off the ground .
A few years later his younger brother Tsai Jui - ting -LRB- as the second son , he was given his father 's surname -RRB- got married and followed in Wu Chien - lo 's footsteps by selling baked goods and beverages .
To avoid competing with his brother , Jui - ting opened up his store over ten kilometers north in Mailiao Township .
Jui - ting , who in his youth always wore hand - me - downs and crude garments fashioned from throwaway rice sacks and the like , never put on his own set of store - bought clothes until just prior to joining the army .
Who would have guessed he would one day become the biggest beverage wholesaler in the Mailiao area ?
Having watched his older brothers succeed with their bakery businesses , the youngest brother Tsai Kuo - lung took up the same business in the neighboring township of Szuhu after finishing his military service .
The three brothers have worked together over the years to build up their businesses , and an efficient division of labor has evolved among them .
Kuo - lung today is in charge of doing all the baking , and he acts as supplier for Wu Chien - lo and Tsai Jui - ting .
" In a rural area like this , " says Wu Chien - lo , " family members work together , and everybody shares equally in the success . "
Not surprisingly , of course , he has seen quarrels arise in other families over who does the most work and who goofs off , who 's getting rich and who 's not , but in the Wu family , at least , harmony has been the key to success .
All three brothers are hard - working and frugal .
Each one married through a matchmaker , and none of them ever had an album of wedding photos made .
Asks Tsai Kuo - lung , " Why should we work so hard and pinch pennies all the time just to spend our money on something like that ? "
All three brothers drive Toyota Camrys , purchased from the same dealer .
One can gradually save up money by running a small business , to be sure , but Wu Chien - lo states frankly , " Land is where the real money is .
It 's hard to get by just running a business . "
Because his beverage wholesaling business requires a lot of space for large warehouses , he borrowed money from friends for many years to buy land .
Little did he know when he first started that what he bought 30 years ago would go up in price from NT$ 3,000 per ping -LRB- approximately 3.3 square meters -RRB- to over NT$ 100,000 today .
When you throw in the family farmland , which has not yet been divided among the brothers , the Wu clan is worth over NT$ 100 million .
Says Wu Chien - lo , " Who figured prices would go up like they have ?
We did n't buy the land as an investment .
We 're not greedy enough to even think in those terms .
We just bought it because we needed it for our business . "
Sacrificing for the kids
Although they may be loath to spend frivolously on themselves , Wu Chien - lo and his wife consider money no object when it comes to their children 's education .
" The reason we worked so hard around the clock for so many years was because we were afraid that we might not be able to do right by our kids .
We were worried that they might fall in with the wrong crowd after they got into junior high , " says Mrs. Wu , adding that Taihsi is well known for the fact that it has " lots of dust in the air , lots of yams , and lots of gangsters . "
To keep their kids out of trouble they sent all four of them off to a well - known Catholic boarding school in Touliu as soon as they reached junior high .
Each child spent six years there -LRB- except for the second daughter , who only attended for three years -RRB- , and every weekend the two parents would pack up lots of goodies and take the bus to see their kids .
It was a difficult trip , and required several transfers .
The total cost of one year 's tuition plus room and board at the private school came to more than NT$ 150,000 per child .
With four kids at the school , the financial burden was substantial , especially considering the fact that they were spending these sums back in the mid-1980s .
The struggle to pay tuition took every ounce of energy they had .
" That 's the responsibility you bear as a parent .
You want to see your children succeed , " says Wu Chien - lo .
Luckily , all four of his children were good students and had no problem passing their university entrance examinations .
In their little hometown , Wu Tsung - sheng and his siblings are noted for their excellent academic achievements .
The result has been a bit comical in at least one respect , for the eldest daughter was so strictly observant of the prohibition against speaking Taiwanese in school -LRB- a rule formerly enforced throughout Taiwan -RRB- that she does n't even speak Taiwanese very well any more .
After graduating from National Taiwan Normal University in Taipei , she came back to Yunlin County several years ago to teach senior high school in Touliu , and now she makes people laugh every time she opens her mouth to speak her odd brand of Taiwanese .
It makes for an amusing contrast with her grandmother , who does n't speak Mandarin well at all .
In the view of Wu Tsung - sheng , the heavy emphasis that rural parents put on education does n't have so much to do with the idea of getting ahead , but stems mainly from a deep respect for learning .
His parents are not interested in his specialty , nor do they know anything about it , but they have never objected to his chosen path , nor did they say a word when his younger brother switched his major from business management to sociology .
This long leash is all the more impressive in view of the fact that there is no chance that either of these sociology majors will ever be able to make a living near home -LRB- because there are no major universities or research institutions in Yunlin County -RRB- .
" Thinking back on it , I realize that our parents began encouraging us very early to aim high and not feel like we had to stay near home .
We all started boarding school at age twelve and then went on to university in Taipei .
As we got older , we went back home less and less . "
Their studies ended up weakening their ties to their hometown , notes Tsung - sheng wistfully .
Their parents , in the meantime , are doing everything they can to make it easier for the children to come back home if necessary .
For starters , they 've built a multi-story house with a separate floor set aside for each of the children .
Chien - lo explains , " Our two boys have n't started working or gotten married yet .
I hope they 'll be able to make a go of it off in some city , but if it does n't work out they can always come back and tend the store . "
It would probably make better business sense , in fact , to close the store .
People have been moving away from the haikou area for many years , and the local economy is in the doldrums .
What 's more , it will only get more and more difficult to make money running an old - fashioned mom and pop store now that a new convenience store has opened up across the street .
Even so , the couple is n't yet ready to call it quits .
It is for their children 's sake that they stay in business .
Living next to heavy industry
Less than ten kilometers away in Mailiao stands the Formosa Plastic Group 's sixth naphtha cracker complex .
Tsai Jui - ting points out that even though Formosa Plastics uses a lot of foreign laborers from southeast Asia , the complex has also hired a lot of local people , and since the plant went into operation he does n't seem to see so many young people hanging out in the area 's small towns with nothing to do .
Even though the seawall built to protect the plant has blocked people 's view of the sea , and in spite of worries about the possibility of mercury pollution in the soil , the extra employment has won the plant a lot of local support .
Says Wu Chien - lo , " I always say , if you 've got work , you 've got food on the table .
Do n't go around complaining about the pay being too low .
It used to take four days to earn one dou of rice .
Now you can earn over ten dou in just one day .
If that 's not enough for you , then you might as well go starve to death . "
Wu Chien - lo and his younger brothers do n't expect a lot from the government .
At most , they express nostalgia for the days when former general Hau Pei - tsun served as premier , because " they arrested a lot of criminals when he was in charge . "
The one thing that really irks them now is national health insurance .
" When you run your own business like we do , " says youngest brother Tsai Kuo - lung , " a family of five like ours has to pay over NT$ 60,000 per year in premiums for national health insurance .
That 's a lot more expensive than labor insurance or farmer 's insurance .
What 's more , he adds , there are no major hospitals in Yunlin County , so if you get sick you 've got to go all the way to the next county .
Not only that , says Tsai , the deductible for medicine was jacked up " ridiculously high " last year , and everyone is complaining bitterly about it .
Hoping for more democracy
When the subject turns to politics and Taiwan independence , the normally outspoken Wu Chien - lo suddenly grows cautious .
" It does n't matter who wins the election .
They 're all good candidates .
We 'll just have to wait and see . "
Wu Tsung - sheng understands the reasons for his father 's reticence quite well .
Yunlin County politics are riddled with factionalism and the influence of organized crime , and you can find ample proof here that all politics are indeed local .
With over 40 voters in the extended family , the Wu clan is a plum of a voting block .
All the local factions eagerly woo Chien - lo , who has in the past gotten deeply involved in politics and taken to the streets in support of certain candidates .
Over the years , however , he has learned that it is best to avoid offending people , and he now plays his cards close to the vest .
Wu Tsung - sheng explains that local politics in the haikou area are linked only tenuously to what goes on in distant Taipei , and the concept of democracy has n't made much headway here .
The locals are most concerned about what public figure " gives people face " by showing up at weddings and funerals , and who has close personal ties with whom .
What is more , vote buying is accepted with breezy indifference , as if it were the normal thing to do .
However , says Tsung - sheng , local politics probably wo n't be so dirty once the younger generation becomes more influential .
Fifty years of struggle have brought prosperity to our island .
Will it take another fifty years to establish a mature democracy ?
As Tsung - sheng drives down the road , holding forth on politics and society , I ca n't help feeling all of a sudden that there is every reason to be very confident about the future of Taiwan .

The haikou area is known for lots of sandy wind blowing in from the seashore , and for the big yam crop grown here .
The area is also a big producer of oysters .
