Reporter :
Wolf , hello to you .
It was a very tense and nerve - racking day for the pilot who is stationed at this base near the Iraqi border .
He flies one of the As behind me , the Warthog attack planes .
Took it out early this morning .
Here 's what happened to him .
He was going on a mission south of Baghdad .
When he was close to his target area , all of a sudden he heard a noise .
Turns out it was an Iraqi missile , a very likely a shoulder fired missile that hit his aircraft .
He realized the plane was going to crash so he ejected .
All these planes have ejection seats .
The pilots carry parachutes .
Ejected landed in the desert south of Baghdad and then he was rescued by U.S. Army ground troops who were in the area .
The pilot , whose name has not been released , was brought back to this base .
He is in good condition with the 172nd Fire Squadron which is based in Battle Creek , Michigan , but he 's a very lucky man .
He 's with two other As flying along with him .
They , two , were hit .
One came back to the base .
The other we have a picture of .
It landed at a base controlled by the coalition .
That particular A was hit in the right engine .
The pilot also was able to make a safe landing and neither of those pilots were hurt .
Those are three planes hit today .
Another A Warthog was hit here today .
That pilot was hit by at least one missile and some artillery .
We have video of that plane .
That plane has a roll in one of the engines .
Stabilizer in the back of the plane .
The pilot lost all flight control as she was flying back .
Thinking about ejecting .
Decided she could make it back safely .
She came back to this base near the border of Iraq and it 's being described as an heroic landing after she was struck by artillery missiles .
Course , we just heard from Jamie McIntyre about the F E Strike Eagle .
