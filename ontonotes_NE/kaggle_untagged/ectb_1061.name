Grand Justices Rule on Constitutionality of Nuclear Plant Suspension
-LRB- Teng Sue - feng / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
The Council of Grand Justices last month delivered a constitutional interpretation on the Cabinet 's decision to suspend construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant .
According to the Grand Justices , the Cabinet committed " procedural errors " in arriving at its decision .
The ruling did not specify , however , whether construction of the nuclear power plant is to be resumed .
After the decision was released , the ruling and opposition camps came out with conflicting interpretations .
The legislature 's opposition coalition agreed to hold an extraordinary session so that Premier Chang Chun - hsiung could present a report on the policy decision to the legislature .
It is anyone 's guess , however , as to when the controversy will finally reach a conclusion .
After deliberating for weeks on the constitutionality of the Cabinet 's decision to suspend construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant , the 15 members of the Grand Council of Justices delivered a constitutional interpretation on January 15 .
In announcing the ruling , Judicial Yuan Secretary - General Yang Jen - shou explained that the Executive Yuan 's decision to suspend construction of the nuclear plant was a major change in government policy , and since the premier is required to deliver a report to the legislature in such cases , Premier Chang 's failure to do so represents a procedural flaw .
The ruling requires the premier to go to the legislature as soon as possible and give the report that he should have delivered there last year .
The Legislative Yuan , for its part , is required to receive the Executive Yuan 's report .
After examining the report , the Legislative Yuan must vote .
If a majority opposes the Executive Yuan 's decision , there are three ways under the ROC Constitution to resolve the standoff :
-LRB- 1 -RRB- the premier can resign ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the legislature can put forward a no - confidence motion against the premier -LRB- which , depending on the outcome , forces either the premier 's resignation or dissolution of the legislature -RRB- ; or -LRB- 3 -RRB- the legislature can pass legislation related to the power plant 's construction .
This turned out to be the most divisive case the Council has ever heard .
Only six justices supported the ruling .
Justice Liu Tieh - cheng wrote a dissenting opinion in which he noted that appropriations are listed in the ROC Constitution together with legislative bills and treaty ratification bills , and argued that they should be treated the same way .
Once such legislation has been promulgated into law by the president , wrote Liu , it must be implemented unless it is vetoed by the Cabinet .
Justice Vincent Sze authored a partial dissenting opinion arguing that since it is the duty of the Council of Grand Justices to rule on constitutional issues , the Council ought to state clearly whether or not the constitution had been violated .
Justice Tung Hsiang - fei pointed that legislation barring construction of the nuclear power plant had already been passed twice before by the legislature , and was successfully vetoed each time by the previous Kuomintang administration .
Noting that the project got underway several years ago , Tung argued that the Cabinet clearly violated the constitution when it unilaterally suspended the project on the grounds that a new party had come to power and its party platform was opposed to the nuclear plant .
After the constitutional ruling was released , it met with many different interpretations .
On issues of primary concern to the public -LRB- such as whether Premier Chang would have to resign as a result of the ruling , and whether construction of the nuclear plant will resume -RRB- , there has been conflicting commentary .
Yu Shyi - kun , Secretary - General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle .
The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the Cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason .
This is not the first time a constitutional interpretation has been used to resolve a political dispute .
What exact role has the constitutional interpretation played in the dispute over the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant ?
According to National Chengchi University law professor and constitutional expert Su Yeong - chin , who headed the legal team presenting the Legislative Yuan 's arguments to the Council of Grand Justices in this case , the crux of the nuclear plant dispute is about the use of democratic means in arriving at policy decisions , and should not be seen as an argument for or against nuclear power .
The role of the judiciary in this case , says Su , was to determine whether the premier has the authority to suspend implementation of a budget appropriation .
In industrialized nations , changes in policy on nuclear power are a common occurrence , but there is no country where the executive branch makes unilateral decisions behind closed doors .
Heading the legal team presenting the Cabinet 's arguments to the Grand Justices was Hsu Tsung - li .
Hsu notes that while the ruling pointed to procedural flaws in the Cabinet 's action , the ruling said nothing about any violation of the constitution or the law .
The Grand Justices , argues Hsu , felt that the dispute could be resolved by having the premier present a report to the legislature , or through consultations between the legislature and the cabinet .
However , said Hsu , since the government has not necessarily built up a consensus in support of its stance against nuclear power , another option might be to have the premier resign , disband the legislature , and elect a new legislature so that the public can express its will regarding the issue .
If other constitutional rulings in the past two years are any guide , it appears that the dispute between the ruling and opposition camps will have to be resolved in the political arena .
Last March the Grand Justices rendered a constitutional interpretation when the ruling and opposition parties were wrangling over a proposed term extension for all members of the National Assembly .
The justices ruled that the decision making process violated the National Assembly 's rules of order and went against the principle that all decisions must be open and transparent .
After the term extension was declared invalid , retaliatory constitutional amendments were proposed in the National Assembly to abolish the Council of Grand Justices and strip the justices of their lifetime stipends .
In 1996 , the Grand Justices ruled on the constitutionality of the plan to have then - Vice President Lien Chan serve concurrently as premier .
The justices issued an ambiguous ruling stating that while the plan was not unconstitutional , neither was it was appropriate .
After the ruling was announced , the ruling and opposition camps both declared victory and eventually negotiated an agreement on the question of whether Lien Chan would be allowed to serve as premier .
The ruling and opposition camps have now agreed that Premier Chang should present a report to the legislature , but the question of whether to resume construction of the power plant remains a focus of contention .

Plans for the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant have triggered an intense struggle between opponents of nuclear power and those more concerned about industrial development .
A constitutional ruling by the Council of Grand Justices appears to have moved the debate back to square one , with the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out once again .
