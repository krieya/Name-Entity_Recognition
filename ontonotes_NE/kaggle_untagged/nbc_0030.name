The nation 's highest court will take up the case next week .
That development may not be as significant as it seems .
Joining me now is law professor Rick Pildes , a consultant to NBC News .
Could a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court settle this case once and for all ?
At this stage , any decision from the U.S. Supreme Court is almost certainly not going to provide a final resolution of this election dispute .
Indeed , the issue is so narrow now before the Supreme Court that whichever way the court rules , it will likely have only the most marginal impact on what 's going on in Florida .
Even if the Bush campaign prevails before the Supreme Court , it simply means we will move more quickly into the contest phase of the litigation or the next stage of the litigation .
But you believe the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court just decided to hear this case is a partial victory for both Bush and Gore .
It is a partial victory for both sides .
For the last two weeks , the central constitutional argument the Bush campaign has been making to the federal courts is , stop these manual recounts now , they violate the Constitution .
The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear that part of the case , agreeing with all the other federal judges who have unanimously held that this is not the proper time for federal court intervention .
So in that sense , a victory for the Gore campaign .
For the Bush campaign , a victory in the willingness of the Supreme Court to play some role in overseeing the Florida system and the Florida judicial decision making process .
Whatever the Supreme Court decides this time , you say this case could come back before the U.S. Supreme Court again ?
John , if the Supreme Court of the United States is to play a final and decisive role in this dispute , that role is going to come at the end of the Florida judicial process , not at this stage .
Law professor Rick Pildes , thank you .
