Russia 's lower house of parliament has overwhelmingly approved restoring the former Soviet anthem as the Russian national anthem .
The move had the strong support of Russian President Vladimir Putin who said use of the old anthem represented a gesture of reconciliation .
Critics argued that the anthem is a throwback to the former totalitarian government .
The anthem will have new words , eliminating verses that praised Communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin .
The lower house of parliament also gave formal endorsement to Russia 's white , red and blue flag but reinstated the old red and gold Soviet flag as the flag of the military .
