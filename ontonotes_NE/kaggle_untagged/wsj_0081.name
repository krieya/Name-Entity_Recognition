A licensing company representing the University of Pennsylvania added Johnson -AMP- Johnson to its lawsuit challenging a university faculty member over rights to Retin - A acne medicine .
University Patents Inc. , based in Westport , Conn. , said it seeks Johnson -AMP- Johnson 's profits from sales of Retin - A , estimated at $ 50 million , a similar amount of punitive damages and the right to license Retin - A elsewhere .
In May , University Patents filed a suit in federal court in Philadelphia against Albert M. Kligman , a researcher and professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine who developed Retin - A in the 1960s to combat acne .
Dr. Kligman patented the medicine while employed by the University , but later licensed the Retin - A to a division of Johnson -AMP- Johnson .
In New Brunswick , N.J. , a Johnson -AMP- Johnson spokesman declined comment .
