Taiwan Stands Up :
Moving Toward a Brighter Future
Leaders of our friendly nations , distinguished guests and compatriots from Taiwan and abroad ;
This is a glorious moment ; this is also a solemn moment full of hope .
I thank our distinguished guests , who have come here from afar , as well as those friends from around the world who love democracy and care about Taiwan , for sharing this glorious moment with us .
We are here today , not just to celebrate an inauguration , but to witness the flowering of hard - won democratic values and the dawn of a new era .
On the eve of the 21st century , the people of Taiwan have completed a historic alternation of political parties in power .
This is not only the first of its kind in the history of the Republic of China , but also an epochal landmark for Chinese communities around the world .
Taiwan has not only set a new model for the Asian experience of democracy , but has also added an inspiring example to the third wave of democracy the world over .
The election for the 10th - term president of the Republic of China has clearly shown the world that the fruits of freedom and democracy are not easy to come by .
Twenty - three million people , through the power of determined will , have dispelled enmity with love , overcome intimidation with hope , and conquered fear with faith .
With our sacred votes we have proved to the world that freedom and democracy are indisputable universal values , and that peace is humanity 's highest goal .
The outcome of Taiwan 's year 2000 presidential election is not the victory of an individual or a political party .
It is a victory of the people as well as a victory for democracy , because we have , while attracting global attention , transcended fear , threats and oppression and bravely risen to our feet together .
Taiwan stands up , demonstrating a firm insistence on reason and a sturdy faith in democracy .
Taiwan stands up , representing the self - confidence of the people and the dignity of the country .
Taiwan stands up , symbolizing the quest for hope and the realization of dreams .
Dear compatriots , let 's always remember this moment ; let 's always remember to value and feel gratitude for it , because the fruits of democracy did not come out of the blue .
We reaped the fruits only after we had been subjected to many perils and countless hardships .
If not for the fearless sacrifice of our democratic forebears , if not for the unswerving faith of the tens of millions of Taiwanese people in freedom and democracy , we could not possibly be standing on our beloved land today and celebrating a glorious occasion that belongs to all the people .
Today , it is as if we are standing before a fresh new gate of history .
In the process of democratization , the Taiwanese people have created a brand - new key to our shared destiny .
The new century 's gates of hope are soon to open .
We are humble but not submissive .
We are full of self - confidence but do not have the slightest bit of complacence .
Since that moment on March 18 when the election results came to light , I have accepted the mandate of all Taiwanese people in a most earnest and humble frame of mind , and have vowed to devote all my heart , knowledge and courage to assuming the heavy responsibility for our country 's future .
I personally understand that the significance of the alternation of political parties and of the peaceful transition of power lies not in that it is a change of personnel or political parties .
Nor in that it is a dynastic change .
Rather , it is the return of state and government power to the people through a democratic procedure .
The country belongs to the people , rather than to any individual or political party .
The government and its officials , from the head of state down to the rank - and - file employees , exist for the service of the people .
The alternation of political parties does not mean an across - the - board negation of the past .
We should be fair in evaluating the contributions made by those in power throughout the ages .
Mr. Lee Teng - hui deserves our highest tribute and heartfelt gratitude for his promotion of democratic reforms and for his excellent performance during his twelve years of leadership .
Taiwan society has rallied and participated energetically in the election .
Despite the diverse views and stances , all individuals share the same commitment - to come forward for the sake of their political ideas and the country 's future .
We believe that the end of an election is the beginning of reconciliation .
After the curtain falls on emotional campaigns , rationality should prevail .
Under the supreme principles of national interest and the welfare of the people , those in power and in opposition should both fulfill their mandates given by the people and realize the ideals of fair competition in multiparty politics , as well as the checks and balances of democratic politics .
A democratic society with fair competition , tolerance and trust is the strongest impetus for a nation 's development .
Placing national interests above those of political parties , we should solidify the will of the people and seek consensus among the ruling and opposition parties , to promote the country 's progress and reforms .
" A government for all people " and " rule by the clean and upright " are promises I made to the people during the campaign period .
They are also Taiwan 's key to stepping over its fault lines and rising to a higher level in the future .
The spirit of " a government for all people " lies in the fact that " the government exists for the people . "
The people are the masters and shareholders of the state .
The government should rule on the basis of majority public opinion .
The interests of the people should reign supreme over those of any political party or individual .
I have always taken pride in being a member of the Democratic Progressive Party , but from the moment I take my oath and assume the presidency , I will put all my efforts into fulfilling my role as a " president for all people . "
As in the formation of the new government , we recruit people according to their talents and do not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity , gender or party affiliation .
The welfare of the populace shall be our primary goal in the future .
" Rule by the clean and upright " has as its topmost priority the elimination of " black gold " - the involvement of organized crime and moneyed interests in politics - and the eradication of vote - buying .
For a long time , the Taiwanese people have been deeply repelled by moneyed politics and the interference of organized crime .
Vote - buying in grassroots elections has also robbed the people of their right to elect the wise and the able , and tainted the development of Taiwan 's democracy .
Today , I am willing to promise that the new government will eliminate vote - buying and crack down on " black gold " politics , so that Taiwan can rise above such sinking forces and ensure rule by the clean and upright .
We must give the people a clean political environment .
In the area of government reforms , we need to establish a government that is clean , efficient , far - sighted , dynamic , highly flexible and responsive , in order to ensure Taiwan 's competitiveness in the face of increasingly fierce global competition .
The age of " large and capable " governments has now passed , replaced by one of " small and effective " governments , which have established partnership relations with the people .
We should accelerate the streamlining of government functions and organization and actively expand the role of public participation .
This will not only allow the public to fully utilize its energy but also significantly reduce the government 's burdens .
Similar partnership relations should also be set up between the central and local governments .
We want to break the authoritarian and centralized control over both power and money .
We want to realize the spirit of local autonomy , where the local and central governments share resources and responsibilities , where " the central government will not do what the local governments can . "
Whether in the east , west , north or south , whether on Taiwan proper or on offshore islands , all will enjoy balanced , pluralistic development , and the gap between urban and rural areas will be reduced .
We should understand that the government is no panacea for all ills .
The driving force for economic development and societal progress is the people .
Over the past half - century , the Taiwanese people have toiled hard to create an economic miracle that has won global applause , and to lay the foundation for the survival and development of the Republic of China .
Today , facing the impact of fast - changing information technologies and trade liberalization , Taiwan must move toward a knowledge - based economy .
High - tech industries need to be constantly innovative , while traditional ones have to undergo transformation and upgrading .
In the future , the government should not necessarily play the role of a " leader " or " manager . "
On the contrary , it should be the " supporter " and " service provider , " as expected by private enterprises .
The responsibility of a modern government is to raise administrative efficiency , improve the domestic investment environment , and maintain financial order and stock market stability , so as to allow the economy to move toward full liberalization and globalization through fair competition .
Based on these principles , the vitality of the public will naturally bloom and create a new phase in Taiwan 's economic miracle .
Apart from consolidating democratic achievements , promoting government reforms , and raising economic competitiveness , the new government should , as its foremost objective , closely watch public opinion and implement reforms accordingly , so that the people on this land can live with more dignity , greater self - confidence and a better quality of life .
Let our society not only be safe , harmonious and prosperous , but also follow the principles of fairness and justice .
As we cultivate the ever - growing abilities of our citizens , we will let our next generation learn in an environment filled with happiness and hope .
The 21st century will be a time when " the right to a quality life " and " a refined way of life " are much emphasized .
The government will find solutions for issues relating to the people 's lives , such as law and order , social welfare , environmental protection , land - use planning , waste disposal , river cleaning , transportation and community renewal .
It will also have to implement these solutions thoroughly .
At present , we need to immediately improve law and order and environmental protection , two important indicators of the quality of life .
We will build a new social order so that the people may live in peace without fear .
A balance must be ensured between nature conservation and economic development so that Taiwan may develop into a sustainable green silicon island .
Judicial integrity is the bulwark of political democracy and social justice .
An impartial , independent judiciary is a protector of social order and a defender of the people 's rights .
At present , we still have a long way to go in our judicial reforms .
Our compatriots must continue to keep close watch over the judiciary and voice their expectations .
At the same time , we should also restrain our administrative power and give the judiciary room to operate independently and without interference .
Humans are Taiwan 's most important resources .
Talented people hold the key to the country 's competitiveness , while education is the long - term cause underpinning " accumulating wealth among the people . "
We will soon seek a consensus among the ruling and opposition parties , academia and the public so as to carry on with educational reforms and build a healthy , proactive , lively and innovative educational system , which will allow Taiwan to cultivate an uninterrupted stream of top - notch talents amid the fierce international competition .
We will let Taiwan move gradually toward being a " learning organism " and a " knowledge - based society . "
We will also encourage people to take up lifetime learning to fully develop their potential and creativity .
Grassroots community organizations are now developing around the country , working to explore and preserve the history , culture , geography and ecology of their localities .
These are all part of Taiwan culture , whether they are local cultures , mass cultures or high cultures .
Due to special historical and geographical factors , Taiwan possesses a wealth of diversified cultural elements .
But cultural development is not something that can bring immediate success .
Rather , it has to be accumulated bit by bit .
We must open our hearts with tolerance and respect , so that our diverse ethnic groups and different regional cultures may communicate with each other , and so that Taiwan 's local cultures may connect with the cultures of Chinese - speaking communities and other world cultures , and create a new milieu of " a cultural Taiwan in a modern century . "
The September 21 earthquake that struck last year brought to our land and our compatriots an unprecedented catastrophe , the pain of which is yet to heal .
The new government will brook no delay in the reconstruction of disaster areas , including industrial and spiritual recovery .
We will not cease until the last victim is taken care of and the last destroyed place is rebuilt .
Here , we would like to express our highest respect again for all individuals and nongovernmental organizations that have selflessly lent a hand to the rescue and reconstruction work after the disaster .
Amid the fierce power of Nature , we have seen Taiwan 's most beautiful compassion , strongest faith and greatest trust .
Our compatriots have been injured by the September 21 earthquake , but with the spirit of a " volunteer Taiwan , " Taiwan 's new family will stand up resolutely on its feet once again .
Dear compatriots , 400 years ago Taiwan was called " Ihla Formosa " - the beautiful island - for its lustrous landscape .
Today , Taiwan is manifesting the elegance of a democratic island , once again attracting global attention , as the people on this land create a new page in our history .
We believe that the Republic of China , with its democratic achievements and technological and economic prowess , can certainly continue to play an indispensable role in the international community .
In addition to strengthening the existing relations with friendly nations , we want to actively participate in all types of international nongovernmental organizations .
Through humanitarian care , economic cooperation , cultural exchanges and various other ways , we will actively participate in international affairs , expand Taiwan 's room for survival in the international arena , and contribute to the welfare of the international community .
Besides , we are also willing to commit to a more active contribution in safeguarding international human rights .
The Republic of China can not and will not remain outside global human rights trends .
We will abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Convention for Civil and Political Rights , and the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action .
We will bring the Republic of China back into the international human rights system .
The new government will urge the Legislative Yuan to ratify the International Bill of Rights as a domestic law of Taiwan , so that it will formally become the " Taiwan Bill of Rights . "
We hope to set up an independent national human rights commission in Taiwan , thereby realizing an action long advocated by the United Nations .
We will also invite two outstanding nongovernmental organizations , the International Commission of Jurists and Amnesty International , to assist us in our measures to protect human rights and make the Republic of China into a new indicator for human rights in the 21st century .
We firmly believe that at no time , nor in any corner of the world , can the meaning and values of freedom , democracy and human rights be ignored or changed .
The 20th century left us with a major lesson - that war is a failure of humanity .
Waged for whatever lofty purposes or high - sounding reasons , war is the greatest harm to freedom , democracy and human rights .
Over the past one hundred plus years , China has suffered imperialist aggression , which left indelible wounds .
Taiwan has had an even sadder fate , tormented by brute force and colonial rule .
These similar historical experiences should bring mutual understanding between the people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait , setting a solid foundation for pursuing freedom , democracy and human rights together .
However , due to the long period of separation , the two sides have developed vastly different political systems and ways of life , obstructing empathy and friendship between the people on the two sides , and even creating a wall of divisiveness and confrontation .
Today , as the Cold War has ended , it is time for the two sides to cast aside the hostility left from the old era .
We do not need to wait further because there is a new opportunity now for the two sides to create an era of reconciliation together .
The people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait share the same ancestral , cultural , and historical background .
While upholding the principles of democracy and parity , building upon the existing foundations , and constructing conditions for cooperation through good will , we believe that the leaders on both sides possess enough wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future " one China . "
I fully understand that , as the popularly elected 10th - term president of the Republic of China , I must abide by the Constitution , maintain the sovereignty , dignity and security of our country , and ensure the well - being of all citizens .
Therefore , as long as the CCP regime has no intention to use military force against Taiwan , I pledge that during my term in office , I will not declare independence , I will not change the national title , I will not push forth the inclusion of the so - called " state - to - state " description in the Constitution , and I will not promote a referendum to change the status quo in regard to the question of independence or unification .
Furthermore , there is no question of abolishing the Guidelines for National Unification and the National Unification Council .
History has proved that war will lead to more hatred and enmity , without the least help to the development of mutual relations .
Chinese people emphasize the difference between statesmanship and hegemony , believing in the philosophy that a government which employs benevolence " will please those near and appeal to those from afar , " and " when those from afar will not submit , then one must practice kindness and virtue to attract them . "
Such Chinese wisdom will remain a universal value .
Under the leadership of Mr. Deng Xiaoping and Mr. Jiang Zemin , the mainland has created a miracle of economic openness .
In Taiwan , over a half century , not only have we created a miracle economy , we have also created the political marvel of democracy .
On such a basis , as long as the governments and people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can interact more , following the principles of " goodwill reconciliation , active cooperation , and permanent peace , " while at the same time respecting the free choice of the people and excluding unnecessary obstacles , both sides of the Strait can make great contributions to the prosperity and stability of the Asia - Pacific region .
Both sides will also create a glorious civilization for humanity .
Dear compatriots , we hope so much to share the moving scene of this moment with all Chinese - speaking people around the world .
The wide Ketagelan Boulevard before us was bristling with security guards only a few years ago .
The building behind me used to be the Governor General 's Mansion during the colonial era .
Today , we gather here to extol the glory and joy of democracy with songs of the land and the voice of the people .
With a little reflection , our compatriots should be able to appreciate the deep and far - reaching meaning of this moment :
Authoritarianism and force can only bring surrender for one time , while democracy and freedom are values that will endure forever .
Only by adhering to the will of the people can we pioneer the paths of history and build enduring architecture .
Today , as the son of a tenant farmer with a poor family background , I have struggled and grown on this land and , after experiencing defeat and tribulation , I have finally won the trust of the people to take up the great responsibility of leading the country .
My individual achievements are minor , but the message is valuable because each citizen of Formosa is a " child of Taiwan " just like me .
In whatever difficult environment , Taiwan will be like a selfless , loving mother , who never stops giving her children opportunities and who helps them realize beautiful dreams .
The spirit of the " child of Taiwan " reveals to us that even though Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen and Matsu are tiny islands on the rim of the Pacific , the map of our dreams knows no limits .
The map extends all the way to the horizon as long as our 23 million compatriots fear no hardship and move forward hand in hand .
Dear compatriots , this magnificent moment belongs to all the people .
All grace and glory belongs to Taiwan - our eternal Mother .
Together , let 's extend our gratitude to the earth and our respect to the people .
Long live freedom and democracy !
Long live the people of Taiwan !
We pray for the prosperity of the Republic of China , and for the health and happiness of all compatriots and all our distinguished guests !
