Do CPA's in the US Make a Good Living ?
I used to work for an accounting firm in China .
It 's not a big city , but I always thought the job I had was not as hard as others imagine .
Perhaps that 's because people before me had long established a set of models .
I 'd like to ask those who have passed CPA exams in the US whether you are making a good living .
It 's also very hard for me to pass the CPA exams in China .
And now in the US , I may find an average school to study for a master 's degree , and then , and then do I have to start preparing for CPA exams here too ?
Also , in China CPA and certified tax agents are separate .
In the US , are there exams for certified tax agents ?
Is the work of tax agents done by accounting firms as well in the US ?
