We begin south of Baghdad , where U.S. troops have found what may be chemical weapons materials .
Elements of the Army 's 101st Airborne Division discovered the chemicals buried in barrels beneath an agricultural complex near Karbala .
Troops also found a large amount of conventional weapons at the site .
Initial tests on the chemicals were inconclusive .
A higher level test indicated the presence of nerve and blister agents , but those tests are not always accurate .
The commander of the 101st says the chemicals may be pesticides or chemical agents that have n't been weaponized .
