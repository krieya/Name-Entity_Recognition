Like many Heartland states , Iowa has had trouble keeping young people down on the farm or anywhere within state lines .
With population waning , the state is looking beyond its borders for newcomers .
As ABC 's Jim Sciutto reports , one little town may provide a big lesson .
On homecoming night Postville feels like Hometown , USA , but a look around this town of 2,000 shows it 's become a miniature Ellis Island .
This was an all - white , all - christian community that all the sudden was taken over -- not taken over , that 's a very bad choice of words , but invaded by , perhaps different groups .
It began when a Hasidic Jewish family bought one of the town 's two meat - packing plants 13 years ago .
First they brought in other Hasidic Jews , then Mexicans , Palestinians , Ukrainians .
The plant and another next door changed the face of Postville .
I think Postville might be catching up with the rest of America .
If you look all over America , if you did a study of any great city , you would see the same thing .
The plants helped spur economic development in a town that had long been stagnant .
Stores are expanding .
New apartments and houses are being built , and there are hundreds of new jobs , making unemployment almost nonexistent .
What else would you like ?
Postville now has 22 different nationalities , but some residents have n't welcomed the newcomers .
They have no insurance on their cars .
They do n't stop at stop signs .
They do not put their children in a cash -- they 've never heard of a car seat .
You know we 've been here a long time and I think most people would meet them halfway , but that does n't seem to be what they want .
For those who prefer the old Postville , Mayor John Hyman has a simple answer .
I just tell them , you 've got to change .
They 're here to stay .
They 're not gon na leave , and you 're going to have to adapt to these people .
Iowa 's governor is now looking to follow Postville 's example , relaxing immigration quotas .
It 's a goal that seems possible when on homecoming night the starting kicker is 14 - year - old Nikita Kargalskiy , who may be 5,000 miles from his hometown in Russia .
