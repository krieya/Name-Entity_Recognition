Peace be upon you .
What I want to talk about in this topic is the increase in the price of everything without exception .
Is it theft or is it a genuine increase which is subject to the circumstances that caused the increase ?
Everything has doubled in price and no one is keeping an eye on it .
What 's strange is that when I asked someone why the price of agricultural materials has increased when most of it is produced locally , he answered me , " Visit the wholesale center and you 'll discover that those who are increasing the prices are a bunch of " tapeworms " who raise the prices without anyone keeping an eye on them " .
So where is the Ministry of Trade to give us the main reason for these increases in all goods ?
What is strange is that engine oil is priced but the real price is n't anything like it , I mean the company steals in broad daylight .
One of the oil sellers told me that the posted price is just a suggested retail price and not the real price and that you have to buy in bulk to get the real price .
So who is responsible for this ?
And how can any employee with a salary that 's barely enough to live on cope with these unjustified increases ?
So who is responsible ?
By the way , in order to protect its citizens , a neighboring state announces the price of merchandise daily over the radio or by printing the prices in one of the newspapers .
So what is the Ministry of Trade doing to protect us from traders ?
