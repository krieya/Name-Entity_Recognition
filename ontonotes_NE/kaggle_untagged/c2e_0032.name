This anti-Cui " movement " made me think of the past .
When I was in junior high school , a man who lived nearby died ; I do n't know why , but rumors started flying , everybody said his wife murdered him .
The two of them had been together for many years , and at the time their two children were older than I was .
This man was very honest , and the woman had always been very sociable , and even though the medical examiner had already examined the body , I do n't know where all this talk came from , but the man 's family insisted on reopening the casket and re-examining it .
This affair stirred up quite a hubbub in our little town .
My mom , too , just kept discussing it on and on .
To my mind it was totally uninteresting , I just felt these middle - aged women were extremely suspicious , and I could n't see what all the fuss was over that woman .
Then one day my mom was at the table , the saliva spraying , and I just could n't stand it anymore .
Mom , do n't keep repeating what other people say , OK ?
You say somebody killed somebody ; what proof do you have ?
My mom rapped her chopsticks on the table : You 're just a kid , what do you know ?
There are no waves without wind ; if this were nothing , people would n't be talking about it so much .
I did n't dare answer the old lady back , but I thought to myself : Just wait and see , wait until this woman has been proven innocent , then you wo n't have anything to say .
This woman was really quite a character ; not only was she on good terms with some of the bigwigs at the plant , she was also quite familiar with the head of the city 's public security bureau , who had been transferred over temporarily from the plant .
The matter of whether to open the casket dragged on and on , and finally , because the pressure from public opinion was so great , they re-examined the body , and the result was poisoning .
When that came out , everybody was in an uproar .
To calm the public , finally there was a trial , and the woman was found guilty of murdering her husband .
Everybody felt that , in such a case , she would certainly get the death penalty , but she was given a stay of execution .
After several years , the head of the city 's public security bureau became head of the provincial public security department , and then some people said that again this woman might show up in the provincial capital .
I think that if the world did not have " wretched men " who waste endless time tangled up in this sort of thing like Cui 's , or " big - mouthed women " like my mother , people like them , who I feel have always been good at certain things , then people would be able to get away with murder or other crimes .
