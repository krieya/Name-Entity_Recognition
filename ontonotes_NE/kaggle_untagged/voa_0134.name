Palestinian officials have turned down a new peace proposal by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak .
Mr. Barak declared Thursday , he is ready to recognize an independent Palestinian state , but added that sensitive issues , such as control over Jerusalem , should be set aside for up to three years .
Palestinian leaders rejected the offer , calling it an interim plan that fails to address their core concerns , namely the fate of Jerusalem and the return of millions of Palestinian refugees .
