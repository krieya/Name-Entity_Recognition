ROC Diplomacy on the Move
Ever since the Republic of China withdrew from the United Nations in 1971 , nearly 30 years ago , Taiwan 's foreign relations have been in a state of chronic crisis - leaving the people of Taiwan with a diplomatic sword of Damocles hanging permanently overhead .
In the last 30 years , Taiwan has become an economic powerhouse , and Taiwanese have become world travelers , yet there 's not a trace of Taiwan in the United Nations .
The shooting may have stopped half a century ago in the Chinese Civil War , but the war has been extended by other means - diplomacy .
The overall international environment has not changed , but Taiwan 's government has .
Now the Democratic Progressive Party -LRB- DPP -RRB- , with which the Chinese Communist Party has no historical relationship , is the ruling party .
In line with the old saying " the newborn calf does n't know that it should fear the tiger , " the new government has been especially active on the diplomatic front .
In June of this year , Foreign Minister Tien Hung - mao visited Macedonia and the Vatican , the two countries in Europe that have formal diplomatic relations with the ROC .
In August , President Chen Shui - bian traveled to six of Taiwan 's diplomatic partners in Central America and Africa .
In September , Tien Hung - mao again journeyed to Europe , while Vice President Annette Lu followed up on the president 's trip to with a visit of her own to ROC diplomatic partners in Latin America .
As is commonly known , Taiwan 's diplomatic difficulties mainly are due to the cross-strait confrontation .
Will the flurry of high - level visits abroad by the new government bring the diplomatic breakthrough that Taiwan 's people almost do n't dare to hope for ?
Will China adopt a new containment policy ?
What counter-measures does the Taiwan government have ?
In these visits abroad , the president and vice president traveled with large retinues , but the foreign minister kept a low profile .
Does the new government have anything in its bag of tricks that the old hands in the former KMT administration did not try ?
Some say that " national sovereignty " and " economic assistance " are the two " Achilles heels " of Taiwan 's foreign relations .
As soon as they are mentioned , they draw crippling fire .
" National sovereignty " meets with powerful resistance from mainland China , which resists Taiwan 's efforts to establish interstate diplomatic links , a key indicator of sovereignty .
" Economic assistance , " on the other hand , though an important tool in maintaining diplomatic ties , has been frequently ridiculed in Taiwan as " checkbook diplomacy . "
Achilles heels
" National sovereignty " is reflected in a country 's ability to engage in diplomatic relations , but in this most critical area for national survival , Taiwan has long been suffering from PRC efforts to undercut Taiwan 's international status .
Indeed , as Levi C. Ying , an overseas Chinese legislator from the New Party , says , mainland China is the only real obstacle and enemy to Taiwan 's foreign relations .
In 1998 the PRC made the boast that by the year 2000 the ROC would have zero diplomatic partners , and moved to undercut Taiwan 's relationships .
They are still trying to achieve this target .
This July , a book published by the PRC entitled Chinese Foreign Policy , the Year 2000 , declared that its most important foreign policy goal is to " reunify the country , " and strongly attacked Taiwan 's efforts to be admitted to the United Nations .
In terms of its relationships with the US and Japan , mainland China makes the " Taiwan problem " a top priority .
Liu Pi - jung , a professor of politics at Soochow University , says that in looking at the diplomatic struggle between the ROC and PRC , it is useful to distinguish three arenas : the Asia - Pacific situation , formal diplomatic relations , and international organizations .
In terms of the Asia - Pacific situation , the PRC strongly resists any international support for Taiwan , such as the idea of placing Taiwan within the scope of the " Guidelines for US - Japan Defense Cooperation . "
Thus the attitude of the US has become one of the key factors in cross-strait relations .
Since the new DPP administration took office in Taipei , the PRC has been deeply worried by the party 's advocacy of Taiwan independence .
As a result , the two sides have yet to open any formal dialogue mechanism such as existed before the freezing of cross-strait relations which occurred after former president Lee Teng - hui went to the US in 1996 .
Meanwhile , Taiwan 's position in the US - PRC - ROC triangle has deteriorated as a result of Lee Teng - hui 's " special state - to - state " formula and mainland China 's active efforts to improve relations with the US .
An example of the latter is the September visit of PRC President Jiang Zemin to New York to participate in the United Nations millennial conference .
In the run - up to the US presidential election , there has been an effort by anti-Communist forces in the US to " demonize " China , and Jiang 's address to the UN - which was very friendly in tone and was delivered in English - is widely believed to have effectively improved the negative image of China in the US .
At the end of September , the US Congress passed a resolution granting the PRC permanent normal trade relations , bringing the bilateral relationship another step forward .
Track two
Jason Hu , formerly foreign minister and now director of the Department of Cultural Affairs in the KMT , warns that the US is already leaning toward the PRC in the trilateral relationship .
The PRC has been intensively lobbying the US on the principle of " one China , " and Taiwan can not sit idly by .
In fact , the new government in Taipei is aware of this point .
President Chen has openly asked the United States to play a more active balancing role in the Taiwan Strait .
Lee Ying - yuan , a DPP legislator who is tapped to be the next deputy representative of the ROC in Washington , states that at the moment the formal channels between Taiwan and the US are functioning very smoothly , and that Chen 's keeping of his promise to make an August stopover in Los Angeles very low - key has strengthened mutual trust between the US and the new government .
In addition , Taiwan is trying to strengthen so - called " track two " communications between think tanks in the ROC , PRC , and US .
" Think tanks have a considerable influence on government policies .
Strengthening contacts between the three sides would help mutual understanding , " says Lee .
Formal diplomatic partners
While the PRC is deeply involved in Taiwan 's relationship with the US , it has an even more immediate target : to break Taiwan 's formal diplomatic relationships , which give Taiwan the status of a sovereign country .
For many years now , the number of countries which recognize Taiwan has been between 28 and 30 , with the current number being 29 .
However , recently the PRC has been stepping up its pressure on ROC diplomatic partners in Latin America , Africa , and the South Pacific .
The book Chinese Foreign Policy , the Year 2000 specifically states that Beijing is targeting Taiwan 's diplomatic partners in Central America - Guatemala , Honduras , El Salvador , Nicaragua , Costa Rica , Panama , Haiti , and the Dominican Republic - for upgrading of formal relationships .
The book also mentions ways in which improvement in ties has taken place .
For example , says the book , last year relations between Beijing and Panama took a giant step forward , indicating that rumors in Taipei about a possible break in relations with Panama were not completely unfounded .
Also , when Chen Shui - bian visited the Dominican Republic in August , the ROC ambassador there reported that in 1997 , the PRC managed to get the Dominican Republic 's agreement to the establishment of a PRC office in the DR capital by playing on the DR 's desire to extend its consular rights in Hong Kong .
In Africa , last year the PRC tried very hard to get Taiwan 's eight diplomatic partners on that continent to participate in the " Sino - African Cooperation Forum " held in Beijing in October .
Although ultimately all eight refused , the PRC 's determination to strengthen interactions with these eight countries is unmistakable .
Meanwhile , in the South Pacific , there were gains and losses , with the ROC losing its formal ties with Tonga but gaining formal recognition from the Marshall Islands .
Fish in water
Taiwan does not have many cards to play in developing formal diplomatic relationships .
Early on , Taiwan 's agricultural technology and the dedication of its agricultural cooperation teams helped maintain relations with African and South Pacific countries .
In recent years , Taiwan 's economic power - including both financial assistance and overseas investment - has added another card to play .
Nevertheless , Taiwan 's foreign assistance programs have been a subject of considerable criticism at home .
In the past the Democratic Progressive Party repeatedly attacked foreign aid , and the fact that the DPP now holds the presidency has n't reduced the general dissatisfaction with it .
Levi Ying says that the old government gave out financial assistance " as if money grew on trees . "
Yet the new government , which criticized this policy in the past , is following the same old path .
" Although you can argue that it is vital to maintain formal diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible until such time as there is a tacit diplomatic cease - fire with Communist China , today , when Taiwan 's budget faces growing constraints and the island has not yet recovered from the recent earthquake , it is not acceptable for the government to be spreading such a huge amount of money abroad . "
What is so important about financial assistance that both the old and the new administrations place such emphasis on it ?
Former foreign minister Jason Hu defends foreign aid by arguing that there are two kinds of countries in the world : those that help and those that need help .
In the past Taiwan was a recipient of American aid , so now that Taiwan has the economic power to return the favor to the international community , it should do so .
Moreover , explains Hu , " In fact the amount of money Taiwan spends on foreign assistance is very limited .
Currently the UN asks that OECD countries try to spend 0.7 % of their GNP on foreign aid .
Although most countries do not reach this level , most spend at least 0.2 % .
Taiwan , on the other hand , is spending only about 0.1 % ! "
Since there is a basic obligation to help all countries in need , and Taiwan is already doing less than it should , it is all the more understandable that Taiwan gives aid to countries with which it has formal diplomatic relations .
Jaw - ling Joanne Chang , a researcher at the Institute of European and American Studies at the Academia Sinica , says that the public needs to look at the issue from a new angle .
Relations between the ROC and its diplomatic partners should be seen as mutually beneficial .
Taiwan 's diplomatic partners have economic needs , so we give financial assistance .
We have diplomatic problems , so our diplomatic partners support our entry into international organizations .
Each side gets something it needs , and the relationship can not be summed up as a purely financial one .
Chang continues : " It is shallow to see the maintenance of relations between the ROC and its diplomatic partners as depending only on money .
Ties with some Latin American countries go back 40 or 50 years .
Such a long period of friendship can not be explained only by the size or wealth of the countries involved .
" In fact , in recent years the PRC has spent much larger sums of money than Taiwan in trying to woo away the ROC 's diplomatic partners .
In addition , it often dangles its enormous domestic market before them as an inducement .
Take for example the so - called " banana diplomacy " the PRC employed toward Costa Rica three years ago .
Attempting to take advantage of the fact that bananas are Costa Rica 's main export , the PRC , through private channels , indicated that it would be willing to purchase Costa Rican bananas at a high price .
However , because the PRC has no formal diplomatic relations with Costa Rica , they would have to add a 40 % customs tax .
This was clearly an effort to use commercial incentives to force the Costa Rican government 's hand .
As it turned out , Costa Rican bananas had been contracted out early to large corporations , and also some of the companies commissioned by the PRC failed to pay up as promised , causing Costa Rican farmers to lose confidence in them .
As a result , the PRC goal was not achieved .
Nonetheless , from this case you can see that PRC diplomacy has been extended to cover the commercial field as well .
Learning from this , President Chen says that Taiwan must deepen its economic diplomacy .
The government must take the lead in negotiating the construction of markets and the creation of business opportunities with other countries and international organizations .
Meanwhile , businesses must collectively move to the front line .
Only in this way can a win - win situation for both diplomacy and trade be created .
The problem is that Taiwan has been engaged in economic diplomacy for many years now , yet the results are not particularly obvious .
Jason Hu says that currently economic diplomacy has shown only limited results , but there are still areas where the new government can work harder .
" The main thing the government can do is provide information and convenience .
This requires coordination among the Government Information Office [ GIO ] , MOEA , and foreign ministry .
Yet , so far , only the GIO has sent staff to diplomatic partners to coordinate , while the MOEA has not posted staff to all relevant overseas offices , " he says .
Greater effort and creativity is needed in economic diplomacy , which in turn requires more study and discussion among the political parties , businessmen , and the academic community , as well as greater flexibility and coordination in the MOFA and other government agencies .
Process vs. outcomes
The number of ROC diplomatic partners is far behind that of the PRC , which seriously impedes Taiwan 's efforts to take part in international organizations .
For international organizations of which the PRC is already member , such as the United Nations , although Taiwan has repeatedly knocked at the door , it has met with repeated failure as a result of international pressure imposed by the PRC under the " one China " principle .
As for the World Trade Organi - zation , to which both sides are attempting to gain entry as early as possible , the PRC has brought its diplomatic superiority to bear in order to ensure that it will enter prior to Taiwan .
However , because negotiations with the United States on early PRC entry have not reached a successful outcome , PRC entry has been continually postponed , which has seriously affected the schedule for ROC entry .
In this age of the global village , international organizations are increasingly important .
How much room to maneuver does Taiwan have in this respect ?
Lo Chih - cheng , chairman of Research and Planning Board at the MOFA , believes that Taiwan still has room to maneuver in terms of international economic organizations .
But as for the UN and its affiliated organizations , such as the World Health Organization or UNESCO , the ROC faces countless obstacles .
In fact , the ROC is currently the only nation that enjoys sovereignty that is excluded from United Nations .
When Chen Shui - bian visited Costa Rica in August , the president of that country , Miguel Angel Rodriguez , indicated for the first time that his country would be willing to help Taiwan enter the UN .
But he suggested that Taiwan should reconsider its tactical approach ; otherwise repeated failure could cause people to lose interest and faith .
In fact , this has already happened in Taiwan 's public , which has seen the UN effort fail repeatedly .
People are wondering whether something should be changed in the ROC approach to the UN .
Lo Chih - cheng says that you can not only look at the results of efforts to enter the UN - you also have to look at the significance of the process .
" Applying for entry to the UN demonstrates that Taiwan is a sovereign state and is qualified to be a UN member .
This reminds the international community to be aware of Taiwan 's existence .
In addition , from the perspective of the foreign ministry , efforts to re-enter the UN are not only excellent training for diplomatic personnel , but also provide a regular test of how secure relations are between the ROC and its diplomatic partner states , " explains Lo .
The PRC worked for 21 years to gain entry to the UN , while we have only been at it a few years .
There 's no point in getting overanxious .
It 's not impossible that the general environment will change .
This year the ROC application to the UN particularly emphasized that the UN could serve as a forum for the peaceful resolution of the cross-strait problem .
This increases international understanding of Taiwan 's sincerity vis - a - vis the cross-strait and international relations issues .
Flexible diplomacy
Looking at the overall diplomatic situation , the new government faces more challenges , not fewer .
That being the case , so far , how has the new foreign policy team been doing ?
Joanne Chang of the Academia Sinica says that although most people feel that the new government 's strategies - " diplomacy of the whole people , " economic diplomacy , and entry into nongovernmental organizations - differ little from the past , you must remember that diplomacy is a long - term game , and , in the details , the new foreign policy team has already brought in some fresh air .
For example , she notes , recently the MOFA , through its " virtual diplomacy institute , " has begun offering a class in " diplomacy of the whole people " that provides training to legislative assistants , political party staff , and employees of nongovernmental organizations .
The aim is to develop the capability to participate in international affairs among a wider public .
In addition , the government is continuing to encourage and assist private groups to participate in nongovernmental organizations , is eliminating the units abroad which have proven ineffective , and is promoting " human rights diplomacy . "
All of these are new approaches in foreign affairs .
Lo Chih - cheng relates that , though there is no direct and immediate impact on inter-state relations as a result of private participation in nongovernmental organizations , nevertheless such participation can strengthen communication and contact between peoples .
The Research and Planning Board intends to establish a special NGO subcommittee , led by the government , to provide information and practical assistance to domestic NGOs in Taiwan .
Lo explains that in democratic countries , with whom Taiwan would like to strengthen ties , public opinion is the source of policy direction .
So over the long term , people - to - people contacts will definitely have a positive effect .
This is also the thinking behind the government 's advocacy of " human rights diplomacy . "
By emphasizing the government 's concern for human rights on the international stage , not only can Taiwan make its own democratization experience available for other countries currently going through the same process , it can bring itself closer to those countries which also place a strong emphasis on human rights .
Besides promoting new ideas , says Lo , the MOFA is also undertaking internal reform .
In early September the MOFA announced that , based on efficiency evaluations , the government would close its representative offices in the African countries of the Congo , Angola , and Madagascar .
As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . "
In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations .
All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe .
" The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented .
In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .
Though in office for less than four months , foreign minister Tien Hung - mao has already been to Europe twice .
Based on his comments , analysts infer that Taiwan may in the near future establish formal diplomatic relations with another European country .
Soft diplomacy
Following closely on President Chen 's trip , in late September Vice President Annette Lu traveled to Central American countries that President Chen could not fit into his itinerary , including El Salvador , Honduras , Belize , and Guatemala , all of which have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan .
This visit , which has been called " soft diplomacy , " breaks the previous mold of focusing on political and economic power .
Instead , the vice president 's delegation included members of the cultural , religious , and scientific communities , and elected officials as well .
In contrast to the male way of thinking , in which priority has always been given to considerations of political and economic power , Annette Lu has emphasized " soft national power . "
Before her departure she stated that Taiwan advocates human rights , democracy , high - technology , compassion , and peace .
If Taiwan can further develop foreign relations using such " soft power , " one day the United Nations will turn around and want Taiwan to join .
Diplomats are anxious for a breakthrough that will reverse negative trends .
But many people say that the root of the ROC 's foreign policy difficulties is still in the relationship with the PRC .
Right now the two sides are at an impasse .
It is unlikely there will be any progress on diplomatic or cross-strait issues between the two sides .
Before departing on his trip , President Chen repeatedly stressed that , despite the tremendous pressure coming from the mainland , there are other considerations in foreign policy .
Indeed , says Joanne Chang , it is precisely because diplomatic and cross-strait issues are inextricably intertwined that foreign policy breakthroughs are needed .
If more states support Taiwan , Taipei will have more cards to play in cross-strait negotiations , and domestic morale will be bolstered and people 's fears alleviated .
As President Chen said , determination is power .
The global values espoused by Taiwan , including democracy , human rights , love , and peace , are the real assets of ROC diplomacy .
The old saying has it that " a person of high morals will never be alone . "
We now look with high hopes to the international community .
