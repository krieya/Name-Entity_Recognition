Big Managers on Campus
In recent years , advanced education for professionals has become a hot topic in the business community .
With this trend , suddenly the mature faces of managers boasting an average of over ten years of professional experience have flooded in among the young people populating university campuses .
In order to attract this group of seasoned adults pulling in over NT$ 1 million a year back to the ivory tower , universities have begun to establish executive MBA -LRB- EMBA -RRB- programs .
In response , each year over 1000 mature professionals looking to recharge their minds and retool their know - how compete for a precious few openings in executive degree programs at top institutions such as National Taiwan University -LRB- NTU -RRB- and National Chengchi University .
What brings these accomplished business professionals back to the classroom ?
What knowledge do they seek that can not be found in society at large ?
And what effect does their return have on campus ?
Morris Chang , chairman of TSMC and a leading light of Taiwan 's high - tech industry , is the hottest university lecturer around .
Two years ago , National Chiaotung University invited Chang , one of the Taiwan IT sector 's most prominent success stories , to lecture to students in its MBA program for top managers , single - handedly raising awareness of executive MBA -LRB- EMBA -RRB- programs .
This year , Acer Group chairman Stan Shih will be a guest lecturer at the university .
The crush of business professionals fighting for a spot in the MBA program at Taiwan 's most illustrious institution of higher education - National Taiwan University - ensured that the acceptance rate for the executive graduate school was even lower than that for undergraduates taking the national university entrance examinations .
Various indications demonstrate that the " back flow education " promoted by the Ministry of Education has become the hottest investment undertaking among Taiwan 's universities .
Three years ago , in the effort to establish a greater diversity of higher educational avenues , the Ministry of Education -LRB- MOE -RRB- greatly increased the number of MA degrees open to professionals in the workforce , steadily reducing the proportion of regular students to professionals from the previous 9 - to - 1 ratio .
In addition , the MOE allowed universities to determine entrance examination topics , testing dates and times , and fee structures individually to help them find and obtain the best students .
Always in search of revenue sources , universities naturally fell right into line .
Twelve institutions opened programs in 1999 , with the number of executive degree programs growing to 34 as of this year .
And as the supply has grown , professionals looking to recharge their intellectual batteries in disciplines ranging from Chinese , foreign languages , and physics to information technology and management now have a greater selection from which to choose .
Management white - hot
A wide range of programs is available , but popularity varies greatly .
Last year , National Taiwan University of Science and Technology -LRB- NTUST -RRB- opened the doors of five of its graduate schools to professionals in the workforce .
Among them , the Institute of Fiber planned to accept 10 students , but only 20 applied , resulting in a 50 % acceptance rate ; meanwhile , the Institute of Mechanical Engineering had only 30 applicants for 10 spots .
Similarly , nine graduate institutes at NTU , including mechanical engineering , Three Principles of the People , and biology , opened degree programs to professionals last year .
Expecting to accept 167 students , they attracted a mere 330 - combined applicants .
Compared to the lukewarm popularity of other graduate programs , management institutes are white hot .
The NTUST College of Management attracted nearly 500 applicants with over 10 years of work experience for 20 spots in its executive management program beginning in 1999 .
NTU 's College of Management opened its doors to 44 professionals on a trial basis in 1996 , attracting a phenomenal 990 applicants .
When 95 spots were offered the following year , the number of applicants rose again to 1400 .
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat - sen University , Da - Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan - Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel .
What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ?
Liao Ching - jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know - how , while seasoned middle - and top - level executives seek an edge in management .
And while most recent university graduates are able to apply professional know - how upon entering the work force , one is not necessarily taught management in the workplace .
Hence universities are the place for systematic instruction on management .
" Given the speed at which the business environment is changing , many new concepts were not previously taught , " says Wu Se - hwa , dean of National Chengchi University 's College of Commerce .
Wu notes that such new fields as venture capital , technology management , intellectual property , and e-commerce are all recent additions to the curriculum over the past few years .
Professor Tang Ming - je of NTU 's College of Management adds : " With small , medium - size and family businesses forming the backbone of Taiwanese industry , one could do just fine without professional management .
But in the age of the global village , many bosses are finding that relying on ' instinct ' to make business decisions is not enough , and that they need systematic management concepts . "
Other management experts note that once Taiwan joins the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- , foreign universities will be able to recruit students directly in Taiwan , and that with the Ministry of Education asking national universities to come up with a portion of their own funding , universities are doubly motivated to establish programs of this sort .
NTU , which enjoys the distinction of being Taiwan 's premier institution of higher education , " never lacks for students , because there are always people who want to attend NTU , " says Tang Ming - je .
More than a diploma
In order to accommodate professionals with day jobs , many universities have scheduled their business management courses during evening hours .
The sight of professionals in suits and ties rushing to class at dusk contrasts greatly from the typical jeans and casual attire of fresh - faced undergrads .
Shuttling between the office and the campus , do they ever feel like they 're burning the candle at both ends ?
At some schools , even professionals boasting Ph.D. degrees are coming back to school for Master 's degrees .
Is the degree really that important to them ?
Mouton Lee , in charge of over 80 employees and production of key components as president of ABBA Linear Tech Co. , Ltd. , is a second - year student in the NTUST Graduate School of Management .
Lee relates that as a youth he studied because he was forced to , but now his motivations for learning are far greater - so great in fact that he registered for three classes at the start of the semester , a decision he has come to regret for lack of time .
Lee , who has also taken short - term management courses , says , " Degree programs are better , since the pressure makes you grow . "
Mouton Lee would like a Master 's degree , yet today he studies for the knowledge it brings .
Ever since graduating with a degree in mechanical engineering from NTUST and setting out to start his own business over 20 years ago , that degree has sat in a drawer somewhere , relegated to mere symbolic significance .
Hsieh Sun - chi , director of the Control Yuan 's Office of Information Management and a 25 - year veteran of civil service , relates that he has already attained the highest rank a general civil servant can achieve , yet at the age of 50 he still has over a decade until retirement .
Two years ago , this led him to consider taking a new direction , and he tested into National Chengchi University 's College of Commerce intent on making connections with movers and shakers in different fields .
Chang Chin - tsung , a researcher at the Chung - Shan Institute of Science -AMP- Technology with a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from a US university , shuttles between his office in Taoyuan s Lungtan and the NTU campus three days each week .
Long immersed in the sciences and always focusing on numbers and statistics , Chang says he feels like he " has gotten into a mental rut . "
Although Hsinchu 's National Chiaotung University offers a similar management curriculum , he was concerned that the students there would be science park types with similar backgrounds in high tech fields .
Thus he would rather spend the extra time commuting to NTU to be around students with experience in such fields as advertising , finance , and architecture .
" I 'd be lying if I said the degree does n't matter .
If it did n't , why not just get into a non-degree program ?
The truth is that a degree in management does nothing to help me in my current job , but it gives me a second skill if I choose another route in the future . "
Advanced training for professionals has become a hot topic among executives over the past two years , but continuing education is nothing new among Taiwan 's universities .
For instance , National Chengchi University 's Public Administration Center has offered graduate extension courses for executives for over a decade , the difference being that , upon completion of the curriculum students only receive a certificate of course credit .
In comparison , a Master 's degree is far more appealing , given that a degree is awarded upon completion of studies .
Burning the proverbial candle
Motivated by the degree or not , the enthusiasm of these professionals for their studies is impressive .
Nevertheless , they must pay a hefty price to be able to study in the first place .
First , working during the day and attending classes at night is often a war of energy and will .
Next , they must shuffle their work schedules to accommodate their studies .
Many of them have to reschedule business trips .
Meanwhile , some become highway speeders , rushing from Taoyuan or Hsinchu to attend class .
And female managers , ordinarily responsible for household chores as well , really burn the proverbial candle at both ends .
" I have my time perfectly allotted , " says Morna Lee , Taiwan regional business manager for Kellogg 's .
She divides her schedule into three - month cycles , and with one class on Thursday afternoons , her company does its best to accommodate her by not holding meetings that involve her on that day of the week .
Still , sometimes nothing can be done , such as the time that she had a meeting in Hong Kong early one Friday morning , forcing her to miss class on Thursday while she flew to Hong Kong .
She had to fly quickly back to Taipei to make class on Saturday afternoon .
Despite often staying up until 2:00 or 3:00 AM to study or write reports , Lee likes mingling in the executive management class with a diverse group of students from different fields , and feels that the new ideas the professors feed them help keep her brain supple .
Moreover , she muses , " We managers are a strange breed .
If we do n't exhaust ourselves , we end up sick . "
Female professionals like Morna Lee represent a minority among executive degree students , accounting for just about five percent .
" If you asked me whether work or family is more important , I would say that since entering society 20 years ago work has always come first , " states Donna Sun , vice president of the Human Resource Division at Schmidt Scientific Taiwan .
Even if she has no classes to attend , leaving the office at 8:00 PM is no different from the perspective of her family life than the extra hour she spends attending classes until 9:00 PM .
She is thankful that her son , a university student , and her daughter , a third - year junior high school student , have always been very independent and self - reliant .
Hiring someone to help with housework , Lee is a model for the children when it comes to studying , even taking them to the library on breaks to conduct research .
No magic bullet
Compared to young students focused on getting a degree , the motivations of professionals studying for advanced degrees " are not that simple . "
They might be after new knowledge , keen to sport a fancy degree from a graduate school like NTU or Chengchi University , out to network with others , or looking out for the survival of business and to raise competitiveness by searching for answers to difficult work or business issues .
" Looking for quick answers from professors is a misguided concept , " says Tang Ming - je , professor of strategic management at NTU 's Department of International Business .
Before commencing a course , Tang tells his students , " I am not in the consulting business .
There are no magic bullets , for if I had any I 'd have gotten rich long ago . "
Wu Se - hwa , dean of National Chengchi University 's College of Commerce , relates , " Academic institutions provide systematic thinking , not the answers to specific questions . "
Wu tells his students that if they put other things aside and concentrate on their studies for three weeks , maybe they 'll find the answer themselves .
Wu notes that adult students bring rich practical experience to the table , and lack only the knowledge to combine and integrate scattered experience .
For them , returning to school is valuable for establishing their own modes of thinking with the knowledge they pick up .
Unlike the 20th century , where the amount of capital was the greatest factor determining success , Wu Se - hwa believes that the next century will be about " knowledge as the main competitive force . "
The book The 500 - year Delta notes that in the 1960s each executive might only have to learn one new skill each year , such as how to use a computer or send e-mail .
By the 1990s , accumulation of know - how accelerated many times over , so that executives needed to learn something new each day .
Now , in the 21st century , each manager might have to learn something new every single hour of the working day .
Curriculums need selling points
In order to satisfy students with diverse expectations and needs for basic knowledge , what innovative means must a professor resort to ?
And what challenges does this pose for the institution itself ?
People are going to fall asleep no matter what , so you have to think on your feet and use different techniques to stimulate their attention , " remarks Mark Gia - khy Tang , professor in the Department of Risk Management and Insurance at National Chengchi University .
Students who have been away from the classroom for well over a decade can not be expected to remember all the formulas they learned in statistics and economics classes way back when .
Nor should classes turn into solo performances by the professor .
Professor Tang 's approach is to lecture on theory for the first hour , then use the remaining time on the homework that each group worked on since the previous week .
Tang 's own " Three No's " policy guides his teaching approach : No midterms , no final exams , and no calling on students .
Instead , grades are based on homework results and class participation .
Tang 's risk management class is discussing how to identify risks .
One of the questions is : " If there were a fairy who could spell out for you exactly what you would experience for the rest of your life , consider what advantages and disadvantages the following information might have for you .
For instance , no matter how hard you work , you are still fated to be poor all your life .
Or what if you were fated to have everything go your way ?
What if , for example , you 're going to be elected to the legislature , or become the president ? "
Tom Lin , associate professor of marketing at NTUST , describes the main difference between teaching adult executives and regular students :
" Executives are always asking questions .
Even when they have an idea themselves , they 'll still bring up issues they encountered in their jobs to see how you respond . "
Often , says Lin , such questions leave him stumped .
Another issue for adult students always on the run is their unfamiliarity with the campus .
In order to enhance their sense of identification with the school , NTUST designed an overseas business camp program .
Last year , one professor made a big hit with over 30 students , taking them to mainland China for over ten days to familiarize them with the investment environment there .
This year , trips are planned to Japan and Silicon Valley in the United States .
Planting in fertile soil
Judging from the manner in which universities are opening their doors for continuing education , non-degree programs , and professional training , higher education in Taiwan appears to be undergoing a sort of makeover .
With these changes , universities must not only take care of teaching and research , but must also make sure they play their third function properly - spreading knowledge and sharing it with the public .
Still , detractors point out that university graduate programs for business executives appear to be elitist .
One student attending a non-degree program at NTUST relates that there are not enough spots to go around in the executive degree programs .
Hoping to make the switch from the non-degree program , he failed to pass the screening that is administered prior to the admissions test .
" If you fail a test , you only have yourself to blame , but tripping up on the initial screening is just a matter of not having a high enough job title . "
Each year when EMBA program acceptances are released , newspapers carry letters from readers relating how certain national university graduate schools compete to accept CEOs and presidents of listed corporations , or the children of rich business people .
The NTUST student expresses cynicism toward the application and review process , suspecting that " they just pay attention to company name and job title . "
Moreover , continuing education courses charge hefty tuition fees .
For instance , NTU divides the school year into three semesters , at NT$ 50,000 per semester , while other institutions charge between NT$ 3700 and $ 10,000 per credit , a full two to three times more than regular graduate student tuition .
Such instances naturally lead to suspicion that graduate schools such as these are " out to make a killing " by catering only to an elite few .
" From review , to written test , to oral exam , in order to ensure fairness , no professor is involved in more than one portion of the process , " says Huang Chung - hsing , director of the EMBA program at NTU .
Still , Huang admits that the bigger the company and higher the candidate 's job title , the greater their chances of acceptance into the program .
This can be partially attributed to the belief among professors that the commitment of their educational resources yields " more bang for the buck . "
As Tang Ming - je forthrightly explains , university professors ' time is a national resource , and if they can have a positive impact on an executive controlling budgets of billions of NT dollars , their contribution to country and society is considerable .
Asks Liao Ching - jong , director of the NTUST Graduate School of Management , concurs , " Which is greater , the marginal benefit of a company president or a staff member 's education ?
The president can go back and put what she learns into practice right away . "
What is more , even if schools do not deliberately seek out company presidents , they invariably perform better on oral exams - perhaps due to their greater experience .
" We must ask ourselves some questions , too , when EMBAs are thought of as giving away degrees to the privileged few , " comments Wu Se - Hwa .
Wu tells his professors that unless they perform well in class , the EMBA can not develop further , as universities are founded upon academic research .
As for tuition policies , Wu Se - Hwa relates that with an annual budget of NT$ 2.1 billion , National Chengchi University spends about NT$ 200,000 per student .
Thus , when it comes down to calculating costs , NT$ 10,000 per credit is actually quite cheap .
Industry retooling
The EMBA craze reflects the cold , intense competition of social Darwinism , but does it also signify that Taiwanese industry is beginning to devote greater attention to the training of top executives ?
Many scholars believe that with the EMBA phenomenon just getting off its feet in Taiwan , many corporate bosses are taking a " wait - and - see " attitude .
This is reflected in the way students approach the programs , not informing their bosses that they have applied to a program until they have been accepted , and not occupying work time if school takes place in the evening .
This way , their boss 's attitude has no particular bearing on what they do .
Perhaps business education may not be widespread in Taiwan at this time , yet a small number of company bosses have taken the lead themselves - taking advanced courses and setting an example for management personnel .
Ma Yu - shan , chairman of Kingdom Construction and 64 years old this year , tested into NTU 's College of Management in 1998 , becoming NTU 's oldest student .
For Ma , " living and learning " is more than just a maxim , as each year Kingdom Construction employees are required to undergo 80 hours of on - the - job training .
" For the boss to lead his team , he ca n't just tell his subordinates to learn , while he remains static himself .
Not to mention that in discussions with employees , if they know you 're the kind of boss who does n't seek to further himself , they put less stock in what you say , " notes Ma .
With the rapid changes in the business environment , poor decision - making can have serious consequences for company development .
" The pressure on the boss is tremendous , because nobody comes to the CEO with easy questions . "
Too busy to attend regular courses , Ma Yu - shan took the advice of an NTU professor and hired a Ph.D. student to tutor him one semester in " management economics . "
Amber Huang , president of Changhua 's Feng Huei Steel -AMP- Iron Company , is a student in the Department of Business Administration at NTUST .
Huang notes three advantages of the boss going to school .
First , it 's good for his company 's image .
As his company must frequently seek bank loans , Huang asks rhetorically , " Could a studious boss be a bad guy ? "
This image has helped him secure loans with little difficulty every time .
Second , it sets a good example for employees .
Lastly , speaking the professional lingo fluently helps enhance his authority .
Knowledge for the new century
In the effort to cultivate management talent , many prominent multinational corporations have founded their own teaching institutions , Toyota University and Intel University being two good examples .
In Taiwan , the Acer Group 's Aspire Academy opened its doors in Lungtan -LRB- Taoyuan Country -RRB- last October after three years of planning .
During the Aspire Academy opening ceremony , academy president Stan Shih , chairman of the Acer Group , remarked that he hopes to introduce management models from Europe and America and mesh them with the unique attributes of Taiwanese industry to enhance the globalization of Asian business .
Shih noted that through the sharing of experiences , emerging businesses might save themselves a lot of groping in the dark .
Are people at the fin de siecle inspired to learn by the confluence of technology , humanities , and economic knowledge ?
At least the entrepreneurs , managers , and executives in campuses around Taiwan clearly recognize that learning is a necessity for survival and an engine of growth .
