We begin tonight talking about the way the justice system deals with those accused or suspected of terrorism , and we 'll talk more about that in just a moment .
First , though with what some believe is a case in point from Tampa , Florida , Samuel Arianna a former college professor in Florida who was arrested in February and charged of being a North America head of a Palestinian group Islamic Jihad .
He was told today he will have his day in court .
Only his day in court wo n't come until January 2005 .
Lawyers for the three men arrested with him say they need that much time to go over the government 's evidence and prepare their case .
Two of the indicted men are out on bond , but Samiel Aryan and other defendant are held without bond which is to say they will stay in jail until the trial starts in roughly 18 months .
This conflict over individual liberty and national security is hardly new .
President Lincoln dealt with it during the civil war , F.D.R. did in World War II , and it is often true that decisions made in the heat of a moment , a war or after an attack look pretty good at the time , not so good as time passes .
Whether that is true now , we can not say .
Others , however , have thoughts and Mr. Barr is among them , a Republican from the state of Georgia , former prosecutor and about the last person on the planet that you would ever call a blying liberal .
He joins us tonight .
We are always glad to see him .
Congressman , good evening .
