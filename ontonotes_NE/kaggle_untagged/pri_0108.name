The Gulf War began 10 years ago tonight and ended 6 weeks later with a decisive US victory over Iraq , but little has changed since then .
The two nations are still bitter enemies .
The United States continues to insist that UN sanctions remain against Iraq until Baghdad completely dismantles its programs of weapons of mass destruction .
The only exception to the trade embargo is the UN Oil for Food Program , which President Saddam Hussein grudgingly accepted 5 years ago .
That program has helped provide Iraqis with basic foods and stabilize the economy somewhat , but Iraq complains that the program is inadequate .
Under it Baghdad has sold 40 billion dollars worth of oil and has received only 10 billion dollars worth of goods .
The rest of the money , 30 billion dollars , has gone to pay war reparations , assist the Kurds in northern Iraq and pay for the UN operation .
Today Iraq 's Oil Minister , Omar Mohammed Rashid called for an end to the Oil for Food Program .
You can not run a country with 23 million people with revenues of 16 billion to 20 billion dollars .
You run it from a security council .
This is totally impossible , even with all the good faith .
So just imagine with all the bad faith .
We know there is absolutely no hope for this program to succeed .
There were other signs today that Iraq 's leaders have few regrets over the action that precipitated the Gulf War .
Iraq 's Deputy Prime Minister defended the 1990 invasion of Kuwait and claimed that his country was the victim of a conspiracy , and Saddam Hussein 's eldest son Uday , who is a member of the Parliament , proposed that Kuwait should be included in a new map of Iraq .
