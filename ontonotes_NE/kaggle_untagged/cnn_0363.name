First an update on a long - running air safety investigation a year and a half near an airline crashed near New York 's Kennedy Airport there is controversy whether the disaster could have been averted .
265 people died in the November 2001 crash of Flight 587 , hard to forget those images , after the pilots lost control of the plane , and the jet 's tail fin broke off .
Airbus strongly denies claims it failed to provide sufficient warning , but critics say Airbus should have sounded a stronger alarm after a similar incident occurred in 1997 .
That is when American Airlines Flight 903 ran into trouble on a trip from Boston to Miami .
The pilots of that plane forcibly applied their rudder to recover from a stall , and as a result the plane 's tail section exceeded its design limits .
Pilots managed to land safely , only after a terrifying ordeal for passengers .
Melanie Joyceon joins us from Dallas .
Thanks for being with us .
