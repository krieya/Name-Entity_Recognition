While the two campaigns struggle over the outcome of the presidential election , tomorrow , in Washington , a high profile ceremony will be held on the Mall to mark the overdue beginning of a World War II memorial , but not even that moment is without controversy .
Here 's Jim Miklaszewski .
In Washington today preparations for a Veterans Day tribute , many believe is long overdue .
Tomorrow , 55 years after America defeated Germany and Japan , a groundbreaking on the National Mall , for the first ever national memorial to World War II .
Navy vet and chairman Hayden Wiiams calling it a fitting legacy to the 16 million Americans who served in the war .
We were fighting for freedom , not only for us but for others .
At $ 141 million , mostly private donations , the monument will feature pillars that form an open circle .
Gold stars will commemorate the 400,000 Americans killed in the war , but these days , nothing in Washington comes easy .
The planning alone for this memorial has lasted longer than it took to win World War II , and now , the monument itself is caught up in controversy .
Not whether to build it , but where .
It 's the right time .
It 's the wrong site .
A small group of protesters has filed a lawsuit to move the memorial off the present sight .
This is an absolute intrusion .
John Graves fought the Nazis in the Battle of the Bulge and believes the new memorial would detract from the other monuments .
We do not want our legacy to be a controversy .
Other vets however , like former senator Bob Dole , say it 's not only the right place , it 's about time .
I do n't -- there would n't be any sight .
But the controversy sounds all too familiar .
Partisan bickering , public protests , even lawsuits .
That 's what America is all about , and it 's why America now remembers those who fought and won World War II .
