From NPR News in Washington , I am Corey Flintoff .
Palestinians and Israeli soldiers fought in the streets one day after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said his nation is taking a break from peace talks .
Barak began negotiations today with his hard line opponents in parliament , considering ways to bring them into a coalition government , a development that could keep Israel out of the peace process for months .
Today Israeli security forces closed the Palestinian airport and the Gaza Strip and blockaded a West Bank town , where gunmen had allegedly fired on a Jewish neighborhood that Israel claims is part of Jerusalem .
