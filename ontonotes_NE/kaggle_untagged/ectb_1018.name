The Age of the Peacock
" God gives a woman one face ; she can make another one for herself . "
This well - known expression is being amended by the behavior of men in the 21st century .
The " male beauty pageant " at Chiao Tung University just ended , and it was quickly followed by a website male beauty contest .
Modern males not only are competing over looks , they also are competing over dressing themselves up and making themselves over .
In his book The Art of Life , the humorist Lin Yutang noted how " commercial advertising has commodified virtually every inch of a woman 's body , right down to the last line and the last painted toenail . "
Now when you look at advertising billboards or magazines , you see men displaying their oiled - up muscles , shiny white teeth , smooth and clean - shaven skin , and elegant attire .
The " new man " is making himself over from head to toe , and is not averse to showing a more feminine side in doing so .
Men are invading territory previously held exclusively by women , and are declaring : " Ladies , you no longer have a monopoly on making yourselves beautiful ! "
" This summer , before putting on your shorts and sandals , be sure to do skin care treatment and thoroughly clean your legs , so that you can present a fresh clean image to people . "
You would probably assume that this is an ad for a woman 's beauty product , would n't you ?
A men 's fashion magazine that sells over 10,000 copies per month in convenience stores cautions its male readers that if they want to have the " face of an angel , " then every day they must do " three - step skin care " to rid themselves of dead skin cells .
Men can now retain their youthful looks with moisturizing masks , wrinkle - removing patches , and techniques for tightening facial skin and giving the lines of the face a more pronounced depth .
Of course , after facial care is finished , do n't forget to rub moisturizing cream into your calves !
Everywhere advertisements are promoting the idea of the " peacock . "
They are encouraging modern men to take practical steps to " decorate " themselves .
The American cosmetics company Clinique had sales over NT$ 1 million in the first month in which they released men 's skin care products in Taiwan .
Chu Che - tao , the company 's director of education and training , declares : " The market potential for male skin - care products is unlimited . "
Phone calls and Internet inquiries from men asking about beauty products and services are outpacing the capacity of the industry to handle them .
Angela Chiang , general manager of Access Cosmetics International , the Taiwan agent for a number of imported perfumes , says that Taiwan 's male fragrance market began to grow markedly in 1998 .
Last year , some of the leading brands showed sales increases of 200 % .
Many male clients have three or four different kinds of fragrance at home , using different ones for the office , long weekends , and so on .
In days gone by , it was considered an extravagance for Dad to go down to the barbershop for a shave and haircut .
Today beauty parlors are offering these aging gents the chance to lighten their spots , change their profiles , and have their wrinkles pulled away .
One salon in Hsinchu called Modern Man Salon has adopted the slogan : " Men and women are finally equal . "
The determination of men in Taiwan to redo themselves is rising .
Men are giving away nothing to their sisters in the search for beautiful bodies , as is suggested by a few recent disputes between male beauty salons and dissatisfied customers .
According to statistics from early March 2000 from the Wanfang Hospital Laser Center , last year the ratio of men to women going for cosmetic surgery was 1 : 3 , compared to 1 : 5 just five years ago .
Lai Hsien - hung , a physician at the center , predicts that before long the ratio will reach 1 : 1 .
Show me the body
It is frequently argued that it is a male - dominated society that creates the need for women to spend money making themselves up as if their lives depended on it .
But who should get the " credit " for this new male infatuation with beauty ?
Besides the fact that advertising and sales pitches in a modern commercial society " seduce " some men into falling into the beauty trap , many observers suggest that a major force behind male vanity are women , especially the women closest to individual men .
Betty Wu , a famous author and television host , says that today seven out of ten modern guys who buy name - brand fashions and use cosmetics do so under the influence of their girlfriends .
Wu has found that " modern men can in fact easily accept change . "
Indeed , as consumers men are often easier to deal with than women , as they are more decisive about purchasing .
When Taiwan was a primarily agricultural , then primarily industrial , society , most men lived off physical labor .
Few bothered to worry about their external appearance .
Even office workers dressed the same every day for years on end .
Of course , rich kids had the ability to dress up , but they were generally seen as playboys or dandies .
But women have had enough of that , and these days have the economic wherewithal to do something about it .
In the past , women could only be recipients of gifts from men , but now they are able to buy gifts to give to their male partners .
Women are very familiar with the cosmetics market , and are now influencing the consumer behavior of their husbands and boyfriends .
With a little help from women , men 's fashions have taken off :
" Virtually all the major men 's fashion brands have been brought into Taiwan in the last five years , " say Justin Lin , editor - in - chief of Men 's Uno , a well - known fashion magazine .
In the past , when foreign companies would release men 's and women 's fashion lines at the same time , Taiwan importers would only bring in the women 's clothing ; now men 's and women 's attire comes in together .
Men also are increasingly feeling pushed by women in the realm of cosmetic surgery and body shaping .
Many men have been encouraged by their wives to get surgery to change their single-fold eyelids to double-fold , or to have fat removed by liposuction .
One mother brought her middle school son to Lin Ching - yun 's cosmetic surgery hospital , saying : " I could n't give birth to a good nose for you , but at least I can have a good nose made for you . "
Macho macho man
In the view of Betty Wu , the reason men are daring to enter the ranks of beauty lovers , and even accept softer and more feminine standards of beauty , is because expectations of men in society have changed .
The women of Generation X , born after 1965 , have economic independence , and no longer are looking to men to support them and their children .
Thus they no longer are looking for someone who " walks and talks like a real man . "
In the past , the definition of " a real man " was usually one who could support a wife and children , and who would play the active role in a relationship , with the woman being the passive partner .
Since more and more women do not expect a man to support them , what they are looking for in a man has also changed .
Wu croons , " We want men to be more juicy . "
In the past it was no big deal if your male partner was n't really presentable , but now an important condition for a boyfriend is that one is not embarrassed to take him out in public .
Says Wu : " I just do n't understand what my mother saw in John Wayne in his dirty old jeans .
" In the past women wanted to be coddled , now they want to coddle men .
Guys who evoke a woman 's sympathetic instincts and " non-threatening " types of " pretty boys " are becoming more and more popular .
Lucia Lee , a young office worker who regularly discusses social trends with webfriends on her own website , says that modern males no longer have that rough - tough character ; guys like Hsieh Ting - feng and Chen Hsiao - tung , who never have a hair out of place , are very popular male idols these days .
When well - groomed male stars stand on stage next to their female counterparts , they both look equally " juicy . "
Relax dudes
Social change is permitting women to devote more attention to admiring male beauty , and it also is allowing men to enjoy beautifying themselves .
Ning Yin - bin , an associate professor in the Graduate Institute of Philosophy at National Central University , and an expert on gender issues , says that for a long time " society did not encourage men to spend time making themselves up or becoming more attractive to others . "
The role society assigned to men emphasized accomplishments in the outside world , so it was only legitimate for men to learn how to make a living .
Wang Hao - wei , a psychiatrist who frequently writes on the subject of men in Taiwan , says that guys by nature find it hard to reveal their softer sides .
They can only put down their body armor after slugging a few drinks down .
Today , they 're getting a chance to express themselves through external beauty , and can show a softer side .
He Tu - lin , a tall and handsome television star , declared his own opinion - without the least bashfulness about it - on a recent radio program :
" The key factor allowing men to have the courage to display their own bodies is that they see their bodies as their own .
Their bodies no longer belong to a cultural tradition or to other people .
As men love themselves more , they can transfer some of this self - love to their bodies .
As a result , modern men have discovered that can they can make a statement about themselves through their clothes and their bodies . "
Whether awakened to a new sense of their own bodies by popular culture , or driven to stay at the forefront of commercial fashion , contemporary men have certainly made a firm decision to make themselves more beautiful .
Moreover , as the service industry has come to dominate the economy , a fresh and clean appearance - with absolutely none of that macho sweat thing allowed - has become considered simply good manners .
Many of the young men one might consider " vain " say that they only bother to create an immaculate external appearance because they need to look sharp for their jobs .
Yet , simply not smelling repulsive is hardly enough to satisfy these men .
A case in point :
Last year , Singtsufang Enterprise imported specially made underwear from Japan that gives a guy that " tight butt " look .
They originally anticipated that the stock would sell out only by October , but in fact it went six months earlier .
Kao -LRB- Taiwan -RRB- Corporation recently did a " millennial masculinity survey " in which 70 % of male respondents said that they could accept the idea of a man wearing cosmetics .
Many foreign manufacturers and advertisers are rubbing their hands in gleeful anticipation of getting a share of this market .
Chen Yen - ying , director of public relations planning for Kao , says that this year at least four companies will begin marketing skin care products for men .
From the celebrity advertisements in subway stations and on the sides of buses , you can see that in terms of market leaders like trendy fashions , hair styling , body sculpting , face care , and even undergarments , there is a tremendous amount of scope for a more diversified selection of products for men .
Androgynous zone
Ideally , businesses and popular culture want to be able to sweep everyone up in a single net , and would prefer not to break their market up by gender .
It happens that many modern guys who go in for dressing up are also showing a trend toward androgynous standards of beauty .
In fact , says Betty Wu , it is not only now that androgynous standards of beauty are starting to take root in Taiwan .
Although everyone has a different aesthetic sense , and there are many kinds of beauty , " you can still identify certain trends , " she says .
" Some years the look is the tough , hard - nosed type , and other years a softer , more feminine look is in . "
Look at some of the stars of early films in Taiwan , like Chin Han , Chin Hsiang - lin , and Liu Wen - zheng , who had a definite elegance .
" They were tall and well - built , but very gentle , " opines Wu .
These days , more and more women , in appreciating men , think that the " prettier " the guys are , the better .
Justin Lin , in his analysis of the pretty - boy phenomenon , avers : In the 1990s , the general trend of all cutting - edge design was " super-youth . "
Many well - established products appealing to the upper middle - class found it impossible to resist the trend toward youth and had to change their own design and style .
Looking around , you can see a transition in the most popular types of male models .
The muscle man and the James Dean type are on the way out .
More and more the models are of the soft , almost feminine schoolboy type , the boy next - door type , or boys who look childish and underdeveloped , as if they lack experience .
You could say that people just got tired of looking at macho men and cool dudes .
But as Wang Hao - wei sees it , the deeper cause of the current worship of ever - greater youthfulness in modern society can be traced to the dissolution of the traditional family structure .
Elders , who held all the power in the past , have become targets of derision .
Businesses have no choice but to go along with the trend .
Wang concludes : " In a society in which individualism is important , youth is the best security . "
Besides adapting to rising individualism , ever - alert commercial culture is also taking advantage of feminism and homosexual self - awareness .
Cross-gender thinking is influencing the way men make themselves appear .
This is especially apparent in the entertainment community , which sets the pace for popular culture and is often the fastest to pick up on new trends .
Many in that field are crossing traditional barriers between male and female .
In the past only women had sequins , embroidery , or skin - revealing gaps as part of their clothing , but now these are being put in men 's clothing as well .
Recently , the top four Hong Kong male singing stars were seen on stage competing for attention while wearing skirts .
You can expect that it wo n't be long before you can admire some guy on the street wearing a skirt .
The new generation of young women mostly have a positive attitude toward androgynous beauty .
As Lucia Lee says , " raw masculinity or raw femininity is of course attractive , but the more diversified is the pursuit of beauty , the more interesting the world is .
As far as I 'm concerned , if a guy wants to wear a skirt or have long hair , as long as it looks good , anything goes . "
The Non-no set
Male beauty is tending toward youth and gender neutrality , and those pursuing beauty are mainly young .
They are the ones who most dare to and who can afford to .
Chen Ta - wei , a 28 - year - old webpage designer , says that in his generation the girls grew up reading Non-no and the boys grew up reading Men 's Non-no .
Fashion magazines taught him to accept more colorful and cuter clothing , and now he knows name - brand fashions like the back of his hand .
Though he has already entered the working world , he still pays close attention to the men 's fashions introduced into magazines .
" This year Prada is putting out purple shoes that cost about NT$ 20 - 30,000 .
Doc Marten 's millennial commemorative shoes have a similar style , but the price is much lower .
I 'm thinking about buying the latter . "
Girls who grew up reading Non-no can accept the consumer attitude of the Men 's Non-no crowd .
Both groups follow fashion closely , exchange information , and raise new ideas .
" I do n't work out to build muscles , but to define them .
Right now shape is what 's in .
With a little bit of muscle , your clothes look even better . "
Chen Ta - wei also has his own ideas about the skin care products on the market :
" Men 's skin care products all assume that men have oily skin with built up dead skin cells , so they have very strong cleaning agents .
But these can damage your skin .
I prefer to use softer women 's skin tonic . "
Cabula Chang , associate managing editor at ChinaTimes.com , who is now 40 , has a brother eight years younger than himself .
He says that if he is the last of the " a - man 's - life - is - hard " generation , his younger brother will unfortunately be of a set whose lives will be even harder down the road .
This is because his younger brother , who invests an hour a day decking himself out , spends virtually all his money on clothing and pleasure .
Liu Hsiang , a PhD candidate who also teaches at an English supplementary school , says that it is certainly necessary to spend time and money if you want to give your exterior appearance a little character .
The materials of the clothes and the hairstyle have to be just right .
And some labels do indeed represent quality .
Liu , who clears out his closet for each new season , currently has 25 pairs of shoes , and more than 30 shirts .
He feels that the expression " there are no ugly women , only lazy women " can equally be applied to men , so he also encourages his friends to pay more attention to their appearance to give people a better impression .
It has been said that " power is the greatest aphrodisiac , " and this is still true .
But in the past , men with status simply neglected their physical appearance .
Today 's younger generation is n't content with knowing that they have power or ability ; young men today care about the impression they make on the outside as well .
Beauty is an acquired trait
Some feel that the arrival of " the age of the peacock " is simply a reflection of the frivolousness of the younger generation .
Public commentary was quite reserved on the incident of " Chiao Tung University has no handsome guys " and the subsequent " male beauty pageant " earlier this year .
But , counters Chen Tsai - ching , director of guidance counseling at the Lungshan Middle School , it is in the nature of young people in whatever era to worry about their looks .
As she sees it , young people are no more vain now than they were in the past .
It 's just that society is more open , and adults are more tolerant .
They no longer have a negative , repressive attitude , and therefore young people are more daring about expressing themselves .
Ko Ching - ming , a professor of Chinese at National Taiwan University who is in his fifties , says , " I grew up with compulsory haircuts and school uniforms . "
In the past , both boys and girls were required to keep their external appearance " non-provocative . "
The new generation has more opportunities to express individuality through appearance .
In the youth sub-culture that aims for rebelliousness , dyed hair and pierced ears have become trademarks .
Ko sees this simply as the diversified choice that is available in a pluralistic society .
" There 's no need to see it as an indicator of morality . "
Chang Shao - yu , a second year medical student at National Taiwan University , says that in fact beauty is learned .
Some of his classmates are able to achieve a certain look without really investing too much effort simply because their parents devoted a lot of attention to clothes .
" The kids from my family , on the other hand , have to figure it out for ourselves . "
His voice carries a tinge of regret .
He and his mother rarely went shopping together or discussed how to evaluate the quality of clothes .
Chang , who takes note of how others dress and of how fashions are matched in store displays , says that the point is not for parents to teach their children to be slaves to fashion , but to teach them how to dress with a sense of character and beauty .
Whether or not you find this behavior among some men acceptable , it is an established fact .
Tsai Shih - ping , a " pretty boy " from the literary world who is now his 40s , sighs : " This is a new era , and men really can make a statement with their bodies .
From a certain point of view , I believe that many men around my age feel very jealous , and even a sense of loss , when we see young guys with their personalized photo albums and their dressing up . "
Dress for success ?
There is more at work here , however , than just looking good , and many men now feel , as many women have long felt , that dressing up is forced on them by society .
Wang Hao - wei notes that in this generation people are increasingly forced into situations in which appearance matters - for example , on the lecture podium , or in front of the TV camera or the camera lens .
People need a greater sense of self - confidence , and feel more and more uncomfortable with their bodies .
So they strive more and more to recover lost confidence by enhancing their external appearance .
" If you do n't have looks , and you ca n't dress well , you wo n't even be able to find a job as a clerk in a clothing store , which is ranked as one of the lowest status job categories , " says Chen Ta - wei .
Go to a clothing store and check it out for yourself -
you wo n't find any ugly guys working there .
In fact , there is still a lot of discrimination in our society based on appearance .
It is not only the young who want to look better , and it seems the attitudes of the kids are affecting their elders at home .
Besides supporting their families , guys in their 40s are also starting to worry about whether they are looking old , and whether their beer - guts are starting to show .
So they too are joining the ranks of those seeking cosmetic surgery and skin care treatments .
Men 's Uno had one article which said : In the past , Western guys lived for sun , sea , and sex .
These days , they think about how the sun causes skin cancer , the sea is filled with oil spills , and sex can be fatal .
Thus a beautiful body , appropriate diet , and healthy recreation have become the new pursuits .
Part of the reason middle - aged men seek better looks is also health , with health now encompassing the realm of skin care and looks as well .
Ning Yin - bin suggests that it is hard to generalize about which group or groups are in the " beauty - loving set . "
He points to the fact that even politicians are playing this game .
In this visual age , politics is closely tied in with performance .
Male politicians are careful about their appearance and attire .
With the help of male beauty salons , skin care products , and cosmetic surgery , these middle - aged men can also win the support of strangers just from their external appearance .
Lin Ching - yun , who often helps politicians with their images , says frankly that many politicos come to have their wrinkles and the bags under their eyes removed before they go for photo sessions .
And many government officials who often appear on TV have been patients in her cosmetic surgery clinic .
The book , Dear , I Want You to Look Good For Me is billing itself as " the first book of sartorial philosophy against which men can measure themselves . "
The book declares that as Taiwan moves toward internationalization , men are constantly required to appear in public places or at social gatherings , so that dressing up is no longer a monopoly of women .
Playboys , not chauvinists
The rapidity with which ideas and fads spread in a wealthy information society means that a love of beauty is not limited to one gender , and body - sculpting does not distinguish between young and old .
Last year , a survey by Tung 's Foundation discovered that the gender / age cohort most concerned about comparisons between their bodies and others ' is men aged 60 and above .
They ranked higher than women or any other age group of men on " willingness to pay money to preserve or enhance physique " and " attention devoted to changes in physique . "
The Foundation 's suggested explanation is that these men were focused on their careers when they were younger , and they are only turning their attention to their appearance as they get older .
The new generation , on the other hand , strikes a balance between career and appearance .
This is not necessarily a bad thing .
In the eyes of feminists , the arrival of the era of male preening has added a number of interesting possibilities to the game of mutual admiration between the sexes .
But besides lustful appreciation there is a deeper question :
Do the " peacocks " who have been influenced in part by feminist consciousness " have any different ideas or make any adjustments with regard to their roles in relations between the sexes ? "
Not necessarily , it appears .
He Tu - lin , a staunch advocate of male body autonomy , did an advertisement once for jewelry for men .
Beneath the soft face was a body of primitive , raw male muscle , with the idea being that jewelry makes a man even sexier .
The ad copy claimed that jewelry would attract women and make them " willing to accept your rules . "
Wang Hao - wei has asked flashy " pretty boys " how they cope if their girlfriends wo n't listen to them .
Often the case is , " I give her a good slap in the face . "
Despite such anecdotal evidence , however , there are hopes that there will be positives from the new male fashion sense .
Ning Yin - bin assumes that as men and women compete in corporeal beauty , some balance will be reached , without going to extremes .
Lin Ching - yun , who has often expressed in writing her conviction that people should n't go for cosmetic surgery unless they have little choice , says that the advantage of men entering the ranks of cosmetic surgery patients is that there is more supervision of the industry ; women who go for plastic surgery accompanied by husbands or boyfriends usually get better results .
Liu Hsiang , who spends a lot of time dressing and making up , has come to feel deeply the trouble women go through in their pursuit of beauty .
Perhaps , when more men can feel the sentiment that women have known for millennia of " dressing up to please others , " gender relations will be a little more harmonious .
