Hello from Atlanta .
Our top story this half hour , the man responsible for U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf says there was no specific threat of an imminent attack in the Yemeni port of Aden before a bomb ripped into the `` USS Cole '' there this month .
Army General Tommy Franks , head of the U.S. Central Command , today testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee to answer questions about the attack .
He told lawmakers it would not trigger a U.S. retreat from the Persian Gulf , even though troops remain at risk to terrorism .
17 sailors were killed and dozens were injured when the explosion blew a huge hole into the hull of the Navy destroyer as it was refueling in Aden .
Franks said U.S. war ships have made almost 30 safe visits to Aden since January of last year .
He added the attack is already the subject of an intense investigation by many agencies .
We 're determined to get to the bottom of this .
We 'll put the events that led up to `` Cole '' under a microscope , and , in fact , we 've begun that process .
We will find the facts we need to find , and we 'll use the lessons that we learn from `` Cole '' to provide the best possible force protection for our troops in one of the most dangerous regions of the world .
