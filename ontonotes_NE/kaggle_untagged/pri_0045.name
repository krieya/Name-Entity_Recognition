You want tight harmony singing ?
How about these guys ?
President Fidel Castro of Cuba and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela made beautiful music together , well , maybe not so beautiful music but they did break into song yesterday on Chavez 's call in radio show .
Castro had more to sing about today , before returning home to Cuba .
He learned that Venezuela has agreed to provide Cuba with cheap oil .
As for Chavez , he is singing a different more aggressive tune these days .
As The World 's Maria Soreas reports from Caracas , the Venezuelan leader is pushing parliament to pass an enabling law that would grant him special powers .
The enabling law will give President Chavez the right to legislate by decree , which means he could rush dozens of laws through parliament , not just economic and financial reforms , but also laws dealing with security and the creation of a new national police force .
Responding to his critics , Chavez recently defended his bid for power in a televized speech .
I do n't think the matter is exceptional .
The enabling law is a constitutional measure within a normal economic social and political situation .
What 's one of its purposes ?
Well , to accelerate solutions to our many problems .
Although many members of Venezuela 's National Assembly are grumbling about the enabling law , Haber Cuniket professor of political science at Desimum Boulevard University has no doubt they will give Chavez , what he wants .
Given that he has already controlled a majority of the National Assembly , it is very likely that the law will be passed and the general feeling is that there is a hurry in approving the legislation because the President seems to feel that he is running out of time with the popular support he has gotten ever since 1998 .
Cuniket says , there has been a lot of public pressure on Chavez to live up to his many campaign promises , such as distributing land and wealth more equally among Venezuelans .
Deputies from the opposition are voicing their discontent .
Beneta Tikong belongs to a party called Democratic Action .
Tikong says , her party is radically opposed to giving Chavez the special powers .
She says , the constitution can grant leaders such concentrated authority but it 's only supposed to be used in cases of emergency .
Granting Chavez special powers also concerns Professor Kenike , who says the President 's deputies will contribute by giving him even more power .
What is worrisome is that the President will be with extreme powers and he will be almost like a king , able to decide whatever he wants .
He has been very hard against governors and mayors throughout the country and he seemed to prefer centralized kind of government than a decentralized one .
Centralizing power under Chavez seems risky to many .
The United States is already leery of the unpredictable leader , who is hosting Cuba 's Fidel Castro and has visited Iraq 's Saddam Hussein .
As President of OPEC , he has struck at oil consuming nations like the U.S .
At the last OPEC summit , Chavez called soaring prices for oil fair , giving nations like the U.S. charge for the products they sell .
Meanwhile , Venezuelans fear that once their Assembly grants Chavez special powers , the President will have one full year to pass nearly 40 new laws and then he can ask for an extension to continue ruling by decree .
For The World , I am Mario Soreas in Caracas .
