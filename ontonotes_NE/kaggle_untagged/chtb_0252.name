Russian troops held the last ceremony to bid farewell to Germany on the 31st .
Soldiers from three countries , namely , the US , UK and France will also withdraw from Berlin in early September .
The occupying armies existing in German territory will end soon .
On September 1st , 1939 , Hitler 's army attacked Poland .
It has just been 55 years now since the Second World War II which brought great suffering to the people of Europe and the world .
A total of four million people from European countries died in this war , including those from Germany .
Among them , the USSR made a great sacrifice in the war to win over German invaders .
Its casualties were nearly 28 million .
Half a century has passed in a flash , with Europe experiencing hot war , cold war , turmoil and tremendous changes .
Currently , both the hot and cold wars have passed , but the end of turmoil and conflict is not yet to be seen .
In the early period after the war , the four large countries , namely the USSR , the US , the UK and France , carved out their spheres of influence in accordance with the " Yalta agreement " , and occupied Germany and its capital by districts .
The highest policy - making authorities in Germany then were the " Control Committee of the Allied States " .
Henceforth , Germany was split up and in a powerless state for a long period .
Not long after , the contest between the US and the USSR in Europe caused a split in the original anti-fascist coalition , resulting in German 's division into two .
On the western side , the US organized NATO and supported West Germany for the purpose of keeping the USSR " in check " ; on the eastern side , the USSR organized the Warsaw Pact , and built up East Germany as the bridgehead against the West .
Germany , being split up , became the frontline of the cold - war confrontation between the East and West .
Henceforth , there has not been a single day of peace in the political situation of Europe , a crisis - ridden continent .
But , since the start of 1989 , a new turn has occurred in the European situation .
Radical changes in Eastern Europe , the re-unification of Germany , the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the disintegration of the USSR all occurred successively , causing difficulties in continuing the original " Yalta system " .
In this great change , Germany became the largest beneficiary .
The rise of a re-unified Germany has changed the proportion of strength in Europe , making the UK and France , which originally were large world powers , worry about dropping to second - class big countries .
The US , the only superpower today , has recently started to regard Germany as a " partner in leadership " , encouraging it to " exercise a leadership role " in world politics .
The reason is obvious : the US wants to make use of Germany 's strength .
A unified Germany is moving today from a large economic country to a large political country .
Depending on its own tremendous strength , Germany is playing a leading role in the European Union , and its role as a " giant " is obviously seen by common people .
It spares no efforts in playing a " bridging role " between eastern and western Europe and participating in the " peacekeeping mission " under the banner of the United Nations , and is striving to be a permanent member country of the United Nations Security Council .
Currently , the historical post-war period is drawing to an end .
But the lesson of blood and tears and the painful experience it left for later generations still needs to continue and earnestly conclude .
