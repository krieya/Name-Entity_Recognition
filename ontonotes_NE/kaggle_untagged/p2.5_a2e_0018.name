Baker 's Stupidity , Al Hakim 's Straying , and the Ignorance of Arab Leaders .
Baker Asks for Fair Distribution of Oil Returns .
It is known that America steals oil returns , or that most of it falls in the hands of Safawis and Kurds .
How can the unjust be fair ?
And how could the thieves distribute fairly to others what they have stolen ?
Did America come to Iraq , other than to loot its oil wealth ?
Baker also asked for the dismantling of the militias .
Who can do that , when the whole American army failed to ?
Even the Iraqi police and the Iraqi army are a branch of the Badr militias , implementing Al Hakim 's sectarian program to cleanse Iraq of Sunnis .
In spite of Baker 's admission that Syria and Iran play a role in supporting the militias and the rebellion , and his admission that Iran considers it in its interest for the United States to submerge itself in the quagmire of Iraq , he asked for cooperation with and negotiation , as if the goal were the attempt to consolidate their efforts to eliminate resistance without affecting the general security in Iraq .
Reality highlights the contradiction between the givens Baker admits and the results he is seeking to achieve .
Baker also considers it necessary that the Iraqi government move to achieve tangible progress , forgetting - or ignoring - that it is incapable even of protecting itself , and that it is a sectarian government implementing its own agenda which is inflaming sectarian war in the country .
Baker asserted that the other security needs of the United States and the future of its army can not remain hostage to the Iraqi government 's actions or its incompetence .
This is a proof that the US army should escape from Iraq , whether the situation in Iraq improves or deteriorates
Baker asked for the return of Arab Baathists and Nationalists to the national life , with the symbols of Saddam Hussein 's regime .
The United States should encourage the return of qualified Iraqis , Sunnis , Shiites , nationalists , former Baathists , or Kurds , to the government .
