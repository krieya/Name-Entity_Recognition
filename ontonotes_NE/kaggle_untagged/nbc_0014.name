Tom , U.S. officials tonight are assessing new threats made against American warships in the Middle East .
This latest threat calls for more terrorist bombings like that against the `` USS Cole , '' but steskically on the `` Cole , '' but specifically targets American and Israeli ships in the Suez Canal .
It comes from Egyptian militant Rifai Ahmed Taha , seen here with terrorist Osama Bin Laden in a video tape that threatens attacks on Americans in Yemen released only three weeks before the `` Cole '' is hit .
Why Yemen ?
Meanwhile , on Capitol Hill , lawmakers want to know why U.S. warships refuel in Yemen at all , since it 's known as a hotbed of terrorism .
Retired Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni said he made the decision to improve military ties with Yemen and because -- the threat conditions in Aden the specific threat conditions were actually better than anywhere else , but a State Department report says in the last two years , there have been 35 significant terrorist incidents in Yemen , and Yemen is one of only four countries in the world where terrorist attacks against Americans have increased -- 52 % .
It 's sort of like the Wild , Wild West .
There is no central authority .
At the same time , the Pentagon launches its own investigation to determine what , if anything , went wrong with security for the `` Cole . ''
We will never have a perfect defense against terrorism , but we need to make our defenses as good as they can be .
But too late for the `` Cole . ''
Tonight , the Navy has finished recovering all remains of the 17 sailors killed in the sneak attack .
Officials here knew about the Bin Laden warning before the `` Cole '' was attacked .
The threat was considered so nonspecific , U.S. warships were not put on a higher state of alert .
Tom ?
Thanks very much , NBC 's Jim Miklaszewski tonight .
