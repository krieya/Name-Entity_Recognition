George W. Bush is campaigning in the hotly contested Sunshine State today .
Bush is stumping with his brother Jeb , who is governor of the state .
Also on hand , Arizona Senator John M Cain .
Meanwhile , Gore is expected to deliver what aides are calling a major speech on education in Tennessee this morning .
The Vice President is campaigning with running mate Joe Lieberman .
Polls in Gore 's home state show him nearly even with Bush .
Nationwide , the race appears to be seesawing back and forth .
We have not seen the lead change hands , after Labor Day , according to the Gallup Poll , in a presidential election since 1980 .
This is the first time .
In 1984 , 1988 , 1992 and 1996 , the candidate who was ahead on Labor Day never went behind .
Now , unless I 've lost track , because it 's been a little hard to keep track , today is the fifth lead change in Gallup polling after Labor Day between Gore and Bush .
The lead did change hands .
Yesterday 's CNN / `` USA Today '' / Gallup tracking poll shows Gore with a slight edge for the first time in two weeks .
The new numbers show that if the election were held today , 46 % of the likely voters questioned would choose Gore .
45 % would choose Bush , but the pollsters say the change is statistically insignificant when the margin of error is considered .
