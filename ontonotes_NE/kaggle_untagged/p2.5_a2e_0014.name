New specializations for female students .
There are calls for more areas of specialization to be opened up for females students .
What are the fields you think need to be opened up to them rapidly ?
Female students need to specialize in the fields of education technology in all its branches .
This is not empty talk ; it is based on a study by the educational techniques in higher education team .
Computer graphic design , electronic , electrical , civil and industrial engineering , school buildings engineering , designing educational materials to upload to the internet , academic advice , family and marital relations experts and other areas needed by the market .
This is what market requirement studies have shown , conducted in order to delineate new specializations , whether for boys or girls .
You can refer to the Aafaaq website for a clearer , more accurate picture .
Do you back a single academic curriculum for male and female students ?
Or do you believe each side has their specific talents ?
I 'm for a single curriculum , apart from certain subjects such as home economics .
As for mathematics , and according to the latest child development and growth studies , and the difference between females and males , at the early stages , it 's preferable for information to be presented differently , but to be combined later on .
But I also back curricular decentralization in such a way that details , standards and motor , cognitive and social skills are defined and then specialist companies can come in and set up curricula according to the areas in question because the experiences and interests of town people differ from the skills of village people and so on .
